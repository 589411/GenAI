To best tailor interview questions for Generative AI job roles, I need some more information.  Please tell me:

1. **What specific role are we targeting?** (e.g., Research Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Product Manager, Software Engineer focusing on Generative AI)  The questions will differ significantly depending on the role.

2. **What is the seniority level?** (e.g., Intern, Junior, Mid-level, Senior)  The difficulty and depth of the questions should scale with experience.

3. **What are the key technologies or areas of focus?** (e.g., Large Language Models (LLMs), Diffusion Models, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specific applications like image generation, text generation, code generation)

Once I have this information, I can generate a more relevant and effective set of interview questions.
Okay, focusing on a **Mid-level** role with expertise in **LLMs** and other **Generative AI technologies**, here's a markdown file containing interview questions.  This covers a range of topics, from foundational knowledge to practical application and problem-solving.  Remember that the specific questions asked should be adapted based on the candidate's resume and the specific needs of the role.
