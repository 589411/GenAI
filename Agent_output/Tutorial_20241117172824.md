# LangChain and LangGraph: A Powerful Combination for Generative AI Applications

This tutorial introduces LangChain and LangGraph, two powerful libraries that enhance the development of Generative AI applications. We'll explore their core concepts and demonstrate their usage with practical Python code examples.

## LangChain: Building Complex LLM Workflows

LangChain simplifies the creation of sophisticated applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a structured framework for chaining together different components, enabling complex workflows and interactions.

### Core Concepts:

* **Chains:**  The fundamental building blocks of LangChain. Chains link together various components like LLMs, prompts, and other utilities to perform specific tasks.
* **LLMs:**  LangChain supports integration with various LLMs, allowing flexibility in choosing the best model for your needs.
* **Prompts:**  Well-crafted prompts are essential for effective LLM interaction. LangChain provides tools for managing and optimizing prompts.
* **Indexes:**  Indexes structure your data for efficient retrieval and usage within LangChain workflows.
* **Agents:**  Agents empower LLMs to interact with their environment, making decisions and gathering information.
* **Memory:**  Memory components maintain context and history across chain interactions.
* **Callbacks:** Callbacks provide insights into chain execution and allow for monitoring and customization.

### Code Example:

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

# Initialize an LLM
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)

# Define a prompt template
template = """Tell me a {adjective} joke about {topic}."""
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["adjective", "topic"])

# Create an LLM chain
chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)

# Execute the chain
response = chain.run({"adjective": "funny", "topic": "programming"})
print(response)

```

## LangGraph: Visualizing and Analyzing LLM Workflows

LangGraph complements LangChain by providing tools to visualize, analyze, and debug LLM workflows. It offers a graphical representation of chains, facilitating understanding and optimization.

### Core Concepts:

* **Graph Visualization:** LangGraph creates interactive graphs of LangChain workflows, making it easy to see how components interact.
* **Workflow Analysis:**  Analyze chain execution flow, identify bottlenecks, and optimize performance.
* **Debugging:**  Visual debugging tools help pinpoint issues in complex chains.

### Code Example (Conceptual - LangGraph integration is evolving):

```python
# Hypothetical LangGraph integration - API is subject to change
from langgraph import visualize

# Visualize the LLM chain
visualize(chain)

```
