Impressionism originated with a\ngroup  of  Paris-based  artists  whose  independent  exhibitions  brought\nthem to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.\n\nThe  Impressionists  faced  harsh  opposition  from  the  conventional  art\ncommunity in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a\nClaude  Monet  work,  Impression,  soleil  levant  (Impression,  Sunrise),\nwhich  provoked  the  critic  Louis  Leroy  to  coin  the  term  in  a  satirical\n1874  review  of  the  First  Impressionist  Exhibition  published  in  the\nParisian \nof\nImpressionism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles\nin  other  media  that  became  known  as  Impressionist  music  and\nImpressionist literature.\n\nnewspaper  Le  Charivari.[1]  The \n\ndevelopment \n\nOverview\n\nImpression, Sunrise, an 1872 Claude Monet oil\n\non canvas painting now housed at Musée\nMarmottan Monet in Paris. This painting\n\nbecame the source of the movement's name\nafter Louis Leroy's 1874 article, \"The Exhibition\nof the Impressionists\", satirically implied that the\n\npainting was, at most, a sketch.\n\nFrance\n\nLocation\nInfluences\nInfluenced\n\nRealism, Barbizon School\n\nlines \n\nExpressionism\n\nPost-Impressionism\nNeo-Impressionism\n\nRadicals in their time, the early\nImpressionists violated the rules\nof  academic  painting.  They\nconstructed  their  pictures  from\nfreely brushed colours that took\nprecedence  over \nand\ncontours, following the example of painters such as Eugène Delacroix and J. M. W.\nTurner.  They  also  painted  realistic  scenes  of  modern  life,  and  often  painted\noutdoors.  Previously,  still  lifes  and  portraits  as  well  as  landscapes  were  usually\npainted  in  a  studio.[a]  The  Impressionists  found  that  they  could  capture  the\nmomentary  and  transient  effects  of  sunlight  by  painting  outdoors  or  en  plein  air.\nThey  portrayed  overall  visual  effects  instead  of  details,  and  used  short  \"broken\"\nbrush strokes of mixed and pure unmixed colour—not blended smoothly or shaded,\nas was customary—to achieve an effect of intense colour vibration.[2]\n\nJ. M. W. Turner's atmospheric work\nwas influential on the birth of\nImpressionism, here The Fighting\nTemeraire, 1839\n\nImpressionism emerged in France at the same time that a number of other painters, including the Italian artists known as\nthe  Macchiaioli,  and  Winslow  Homer  in  the  United  States,  were  also  exploring  plein-air  painting.  The  Impressionists,\nhowever, developed new techniques specific to the style. Encompassing what its adherents argued was a different way of\nseeing, it is an art of immediacy and movement, of candid poses and compositions, of the play of light expressed in a\nbright and varied use of colour.[2] In 1876, the poet and critic Stéphane Mallarmé said of the new style: \"The represented\nsubject, being composed of a harmony of reflected and ever-changing lights, cannot be supposed always to look the same\nbut palpitates with movement, light, and life\".[4]\n\n\fThe  public,  at  first  hostile,  gradually  came  to  believe  that  the  Impressionists  had\ncaptured  a  fresh  and  original  vision,  even  if  the  art  critics  and  art  establishment\ndisapproved of the new style. By recreating the sensation in the eye that views the\nsubject, rather than delineating the details of the subject, and by creating a welter of\ntechniques  and  forms,  Impressionism  is  a  precursor  of  various  painting  styles,\nincluding Neo-Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism.\n\nBeginnings\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century—a time of rapid industrialization and unsettling\nsocial change in France, as Emperor Napoleon III rebuilt Paris and waged war—the\nAcadémie  des  Beaux-Arts  dominated  French  art.[5]  The  Académie  was  the\npreserver  of  traditional  French  painting  standards  of  content  and  style.  Historical\nsubjects, religious themes, and portraits were valued; landscape and still life were\nnot. The Académie preferred carefully finished images that looked realistic when examined closely. Paintings in this style\nwere made up of precise brush strokes carefully blended to hide the artist's hand in the work.[6] Colour was restrained and\noften toned down further by the application of a thick golden varnish.[7]\n\nPierre-Auguste Renoir, Dance at Le\nMoulin de la Galette (Bal du moulin\nde la Galette), 1876, Musée\nd'Orsay, one of Impressionism's\nmost celebrated masterpieces.[3]\n\nThe Académie had an annual, juried art show, the Salon de Paris, and artists whose work was displayed in the show won\nprizes,  garnered  commissions,  and  enhanced  their  prestige.  The  standards  of  the  juries  represented  the  values  of  the\nAcadémie, represented by the works of such artists as Jean-Léon Gérôme and Alexandre Cabanel. Using an eclectic mix of\ntechniques  and  formulas  established  in  Western  painting  since  the  Renaissance—such  as  linear  perspective  and  figure\ntypes derived from Classical Greek art—these artists produced escapist visions of a reassuringly ordered world.[8] By the\n1850s,  some  artists,  notably  the  Realist  painter  Gustave  Courbet,  had  gained  public  attention  and  critical  censure  by\ndepicting contemporary realities without the idealization demanded by the Académie.[9]\n\nIn the early 1860s, four young painters—Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, and Frédéric Bazille—met\nwhile studying under the academic artist Charles Gleyre. They discovered that they shared an interest in painting landscape\nand contemporary life rather than historical or mythological scenes. Following a practice—pioneered by artists such as the\nEnglishman  John  Constable—[10]  that  had  become  increasingly  popular  by  mid-century,  they  often  ventured  into  the\ncountryside together to paint in the open air.[11] Their purpose was not to make sketches to be developed into carefully\nfinished works in the studio, as was the usual custom, but to complete their paintings out-of-doors.[12]\n\nBy  painting  in  sunlight  directly  from  nature,  and  making  bold  use  of  the  vivid  synthetic  pigments  that  had  become\navailable since the beginning of the century, they began to develop a lighter and brighter manner of painting that extended\nfurther the Realism of Courbet and the Barbizon school. A favourite meeting place for the artists was the Café Guerbois on\nAvenue  de  Clichy  in  Paris,  where  the  discussions  were  often  led  by  Édouard  Manet,  whom  the  younger  artists  greatly\nadmired. They were soon joined by Camille Pissarro, Paul Cézanne, and Armand Guillaumin.[13]\n\nDuring  the  1860s,  the  Salon  jury  routinely  rejected  about  half  of  the  works\nsubmitted  by  Monet  and  his  friends  in  favour  of  works  by  artists  faithful  to  the\napproved  style.[2]  In  1863,  the  Salon  jury  rejected  Manet's  The  Luncheon  on  the\nGrass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe) primarily because it depicted a nude woman with\ntwo  clothed  men  at  a  picnic.  While  the  Salon  jury  routinely  accepted  nudes  in\nhistorical  and  allegorical  paintings,  they  condemned  Manet  for  placing  a  realistic\nnude in a contemporary setting.[14] The jury's severely worded rejection of Manet's\npainting appalled his admirers, and the unusually large number of rejected works\nthat year perturbed many French artists.\n\nAfter  Emperor  Napoleon  III  saw  the  rejected  works  of  1863,  he  decreed  that  the\npublic be allowed to judge the work themselves, and the Salon des Refusés (Salon\nof the Refused) was organized. While many viewers came only to laugh, the Salon\n\nÉdouard Manet, The Luncheon on\nthe Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe),\n1863\n\ndes Refusés drew attention to the existence of a new tendency in art and attracted more visitors than the regular Salon.[15]\n\n\fArtists' petitions requesting a new Salon des Refusés in 1867, and again in 1872,\nwere denied. In December 1873, Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley, Cézanne, Berthe\nMorisot,  Edgar  Degas  and  several  other  artists  founded  the  Société  anonyme  des\nartistes  peintres,  sculpteurs,  graveurs,  etc.[b] \ntheir  artworks\nindependently.[16][17]  Members  of  the  association  were  expected  to  forswear\nparticipation in the Salon.[18] The organizers invited a number of other progressive\nartists to join them in their inaugural exhibition, including the older Eugène Boudin,\nwhose  example  had  first  persuaded  Monet  to  adopt  plein  air  painting  years\nbefore.[19] Another  painter  who  greatly  influenced  Monet  and  his  friends,  Johan\nJongkind,  declined  to  participate,  as  did  Édouard  Manet.  In  total,  thirty  artists\nparticipated  in  their  first  exhibition,  held  in  April  1874  at  the  studio  of  the\nphotographer Nadar.\n\nto  exhibit \n\nAlfred Sisley, View of the Canal\nSaint-Martin, 1870, Musée d'Orsay\n\nThe critical response was mixed. Monet and Cézanne received the harshest attacks.\nCritic  and  humorist  Louis  Leroy  wrote  a  scathing  review  in  the  newspaper  Le\nCharivari in which, making wordplay with the title of Claude Monet's Impression,\nSunrise  (Impression,  soleil  levant),  he  gave  the  artists  the  name  by  which  they\nbecame known. Derisively titling his article \"The Exhibition of the Impressionists\",\nLeroy  declared  that  Monet's  painting  was  at  most,  a  sketch,  and  could  hardly  be\ntermed a finished work.\n\nHe wrote, in the form of a dialogue between viewers,\n\n\"Impression—I was certain of it. I was just telling myself that, since I was\nimpressed,  there  had  to  be  some  impression  in  it  ...  and  what  freedom,\nwhat  ease  of  workmanship!  Wallpaper  in  its  embryonic  state  is  more\nfinished than that seascape.\"[20]\n\nThe term Impressionist quickly gained favour with the public. It was also accepted by the\nartists themselves, even though they were a diverse group in style and temperament, unified\nprimarily  by  their  spirit  of  independence  and  rebellion.  They  exhibited  together—albeit\nwith shifting membership—eight times between 1874 and 1886. The Impressionists' style,\nwith  its  loose,  spontaneous  brushstrokes,  would  soon  become  synonymous  with  modern\nlife.[7]\n\nMonet, Sisley, Morisot, and Pissarro may be considered the \"purest\" Impressionists, in their\nconsistent pursuit of an art of spontaneity, sunlight, and colour. Degas rejected much of this,\nas he believed in the primacy of drawing over colour and belittled the practice of painting\noutdoors.[21]  Renoir  turned  away  from  Impressionism  for  a  time  during  the  1880s,  and\nnever entirely regained his commitment to its ideas. Édouard Manet, although regarded by\nthe Impressionists as their leader,[22] never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour\n(while Impressionists avoided its use and preferred to obtain darker colours by mixing), and\nnever participated in the Impressionist exhibitions. He continued to submit his works to the\nSalon, where his painting Spanish Singer had won a 2nd class medal in 1861, and he urged\nthe  others  to  do  likewise,  arguing  that  \"the  Salon  is  the  real  field  of  battle\"  where  a\nreputation could be made.[23]\n\nClaude Monet, Haystacks, (sunset),\n1890–1891, Museum of Fine Arts,\nBoston\n\nClaude Monet, Woman with\na Parasol – Madame Monet\nand Her Son (Camille and\nJean Monet), 1875,\nNational Gallery of Art,\nWashington, D.C.\n\nAmong the artists of the core group (minus Bazille, who had died in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870), defections occurred\nas Cézanne, followed later by Renoir, Sisley, and Monet, abstained from the group exhibitions so they could submit their\nworks  to  the  Salon.  Disagreements  arose  from  issues  such  as  Guillaumin's  membership  in  the  group,  championed  by\nPissarro  and  Cézanne  against  opposition  from  Monet  and  Degas,  who  thought  him  unworthy.[24]  Degas  invited  Mary\nCassatt to display her work in the 1879 exhibition, but also insisted on the inclusion of Jean-François Raffaëlli, Ludovic\nLepic, and other realists who did not represent Impressionist practices, causing Monet in 1880 to accuse the Impressionists\nof \"opening doors to first-come daubers\".[25]\n\n\fIn  this  regard,  the  seventh  Paris  Impressionist  exhibition  in  1882  was  the  most\nselective  of  all  including  the  works  of  only  nine  \"true\"  impressionists,  namely\nGustave  Caillebotte,  Paul  Gauguin,  Armand  Guillaumin,  Claude  Monet,  Berthe\nMorisot, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, and Victor Vignon.\nThe  group  then  divided  again  over  the  invitations  to  Paul  Signac  and  Georges\nSeurat to exhibit with them at the 8th Impressionist exhibition in 1886. Pissarro was\nthe only artist to show at all eight Paris Impressionist exhibitions.\n\nCamille Pissarro, Boulevard\nMontmartre, 1897, the Hermitage,\nSaint Petersburg\n\nThe  individual  artists  achieved  few  financial  rewards  from  the  Impressionist\nexhibitions, but their art gradually won a degree of public acceptance and support.\nTheir dealer, Durand-Ruel, played a major role in this as he kept their work before\nthe public and arranged shows for them in London and New York. Although Sisley\ndied  in  poverty  in  1899,  Renoir  had  a  great  Salon  success  in  1879.[26]  Monet\nbecame  secure  financially  during  the  early  1880s  and  so  did  Pissarro  by  the  early  1890s.  By  this  time  the  methods  of\nImpressionist painting, in a diluted form, had become commonplace in Salon art.[27]\n\nImpressionist techniques\n\nFrench  painters  who  prepared  the  way  for  Impressionism  include  the  Romantic  colourist\nEugène Delacroix; the leader of the realists, Gustave Courbet; and painters of the Barbizon\nschool  such  as  Théodore  Rousseau.  The  Impressionists  learned  much  from  the  work  of\nJohan  Barthold  Jongkind,  Jean-Baptiste-Camille  Corot  and  Eugène  Boudin,  who  painted\nfrom  nature  in  a  direct  and  spontaneous  style  that  prefigured  Impressionism,  and  who\nbefriended and advised the younger artists.\n\nA number of identifiable techniques and working habits contributed to the innovative style\nof the Impressionists. Although these methods had been used by previous artists—and are\noften conspicuous in the work of artists such as Frans Hals, Diego Velázquez, Peter Paul\nRubens, John Constable, and J. M. W. Turner—the Impressionists were the first to use them\nall together, and with such consistency. These techniques include:\n\nMary Cassatt, Lydia\nLeaning on Her Arms (in a\ntheatre box), 1879\n\nShort, thick strokes of paint quickly capture the essence of the subject, rather\nthan its details. The paint is often applied impasto.\nColours are applied side by side with as little mixing as possible, a technique that exploits the principle of\nsimultaneous contrast to make the colour appear more vivid to the viewer.\nGreys and dark tones are produced by mixing complementary colours. Pure impressionism avoids the use\nof black paint.\nWet paint is placed into wet paint without waiting for successive applications to dry, producing softer edges\nand intermingling of colour.\nImpressionist paintings do not exploit the transparency of thin paint films (glazes), which earlier artists\nmanipulated carefully to produce effects. The impressionist painting surface is typically opaque.\nThe paint is applied to a white or light-coloured ground. Previously, painters often used dark grey or strongly\ncoloured grounds.\nThe play of natural light is emphasized. Close attention is paid to the reflection of colours from object to\nobject. Painters often worked in the evening to produce effets de soir—the shadowy effects of evening or\ntwilight.\nIn paintings made en plein air (outdoors), shadows are boldly painted with the blue of the sky as it is\nreflected onto surfaces, giving a sense of freshness previously not represented in painting. Blue shadows\non snow inspired the technique.\n\nNew  technology  played  a  role  in  the  development  of  the  style.  Impressionists  took  advantage  of  the  mid-century\nintroduction of premixed paints in tin tubes (resembling modern toothpaste tubes), which allowed artists to work more\nspontaneously,  both  outdoors  and  indoors.[28]  Previously,  painters  made  their  own  paints  individually,  by  grinding  and\nmixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil, which were then stored in animal bladders.[29]\n\n\fMany vivid synthetic pigments became commercially available to artists for the first time during the 19th century. These\nincluded cobalt blue, viridian, cadmium yellow, and synthetic ultramarine blue, all of which were in use by the 1840s,\nbefore  Impressionism.[30] The  Impressionists'  manner  of  painting  made  bold  use  of  these  pigments,  and  of  even  newer\ncolours such as cerulean blue,[7] which became commercially available to artists in the 1860s.[30]\n\nThe  Impressionists'  progress  toward  a  brighter  style  of  painting  was  gradual.  During  the  1860s,  Monet  and  Renoir\nsometimes painted on canvases prepared with the traditional red-brown or grey ground.[31] By the 1870s, Monet, Renoir,\nand Pissarro usually chose to paint on grounds of a lighter grey or beige colour, which functioned as a middle tone in the\nfinished painting.[31] By the 1880s, some of the Impressionists had come to prefer white or slightly off-white grounds, and\nno longer allowed the ground colour a significant role in the finished painting.[32]\n\nContent and composition\n\nThe  Impressionists  reacted  to  modernity  by  exploring  \"a  wide  range  of  non-\nacademic subjects in art\" such as middle-class leisure activities and \"urban themes,\nincluding  train  stations,  cafés,  brothels,  the  theater,  and  dance.\"[33]  They  found\ninspiration in the newly widened avenues of Paris, bounded by new tall buildings\nthat  offered  opportunities  to  depict  bustling  crowds,  popular  entertainments,  and\nnocturnal lighting in artificially closed-off spaces.[34]\n\nA  painting  such  as  Caillebotte's  Paris  Street;  Rainy  Day  (1877)  strikes  a  modern\nnote  by  emphasizing  the  isolation  of  individuals  amid  the  outsized  buildings  and\nspaces of the urban environment.[35] When painting landscapes, the Impressionists\ndid not hesitate to include the factories that were proliferating in the countryside.\nEarlier  painters  of  landscapes  had  conventionally  avoided  smokestacks  and  other\nsigns of industrialization, regarding them as blights on nature's order and unworthy\nof art.[36]\n\nCamille Pissarro, Hay Harvest at\nÉragny, 1901, National Gallery of\nCanada, Ottawa, Ontario\n\nPrior to the Impressionists, other painters, notably such 17th-century Dutch painters\nas Jan Steen, had emphasized common subjects, but their methods of composition\nwere  traditional.  They  arranged  their  compositions  so  that  the  main  subject\ncommanded the viewer's attention. J. M. W. Turner, while an artist of the Romantic\nera, anticipated the style of impressionism with his artwork.[37] The Impressionists\nrelaxed  the  boundary  between  subject  and  background  so  that  the  effect  of  an\nImpressionist painting often resembles a snapshot, a part of a larger reality captured\nas  if  by  chance.[38]  Photography  was  gaining  popularity,  and  as  cameras  became\nmore  portable,  photographs  became  more  candid.  Photography \ninspired\nImpressionists to represent momentary action, not only in the fleeting lights of a landscape, but in the day-to-day lives of\npeople.[39][40]\n\nBerthe Morisot, Reading, 1873,\nCleveland Museum of Art\n\nThe  development  of  Impressionism  can  be  considered  partly  as  a  reaction  by  artists  to  the  challenge  presented  by\nphotography, which seemed to devalue the artist's skill in reproducing reality. Both portrait and landscape paintings were\ndeemed  somewhat  deficient  and  lacking  in  truth  as  photography  \"produced  lifelike  images  much  more  efficiently  and\nreliably\".[41]\n\nIn spite of this, photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of creative expression, and rather than compete\nwith photography to emulate reality, artists focused \"on the one thing they could inevitably do better than the photograph—\nby  further  developing  into  an  art  form  its  very  subjectivity  in  the  conception  of  the  image,  the  very  subjectivity  that\nphotography  eliminated\".[41]  The  Impressionists  sought  to  express  their  perceptions  of  nature,  rather  than  create  exact\nrepresentations.  This  allowed  artists  to  depict  subjectively  what  they  saw  with  their  \"tacit  imperatives  of  taste  and\nconscience\".[42]  Photography  encouraged  painters  to  exploit  aspects  of  the  painting  medium,  like  colour,  which\nphotography  then  lacked:  \"The  Impressionists  were  the  first  to  consciously  offer  a  subjective  alternative  to  the\nphotograph\".[41]\n\n\fAnother  major  influence  was  Japanese  ukiyo-e  art  prints  (Japonism).  The  art  of\nthese prints contributed significantly to the \"snapshot\" angles and unconventional\ncompositions that became characteristic of Impressionism. An example is Monet's\nJardin à Sainte-Adresse, 1867, with its bold blocks of colour and composition on a\nstrong diagonal slant showing the influence of Japanese prints.[44]\n\nEdgar Degas was both an avid photographer and a collector of Japanese prints.[45]\nHis  The  Dance  Class  (La  classe  de  danse)  of  1874  shows  both  influences  in  its\nasymmetrical composition. The dancers are seemingly caught off guard in various\nawkward  poses,  leaving  an  expanse  of  empty  floor  space  in  the  lower  right\nquadrant.  He  also  captured  his  dancers  in  sculpture,  such  as  the  Little  Dancer  of\nFourteen Years.\n\nFemale Impressionists\n\nImpressionists,  in  varying  degrees,  were  looking  for  ways  to  depict  visual\nexperience and contemporary subjects.[46] Female Impressionists were interested in\nthese  same  ideals  but  had  many  social  and  career  limitations  compared  to  male\nImpressionists.[47]  They  were  particularly  excluded  from  the  imagery  of  the\nbourgeois social sphere of the boulevard, cafe, and dance hall.[48]\n\nClaude Monet, Jardin à Sainte-\nAdresse, 1867, Metropolitan\nMuseum of Art, New York.,[43] a\nwork showing the influence of\nJapanese prints\n\nAs  well  as  imagery,  women  were  excluded  from  the  formative  discussions  that\nresulted in meetings in those places. That was where male Impressionists were able\nto  form  and  share  ideas  about  Impressionism.[48]  In  the  academic  realm,  women\nwere believed to be incapable of handling complex subjects, which led teachers to\nrestrict what they taught female students.[49] It was also considered unladylike to\nexcel in art, since women's true talents were then believed to center on homemaking and mothering.[49]\n\nBerthe Morisot, The Harbour at\nLorient, 1869, National Gallery of\nArt, Washington, D.C.\n\nYet several women were able to find success during their lifetime, even though their careers were affected by personal\ncircumstances – Bracquemond, for example, had a husband who was resentful of her work which caused her to give up\npainting.[50] The four most well known, namely, Mary Cassatt, Eva Gonzalès, Marie Bracquemond, and Berthe Morisot,\nare,  and  were,  often  referred  to  as  the  'Women  Impressionists'.  Their  participation  in  the  series  of  eight  Impressionist\nexhibitions that took place in Paris from 1874 to 1886 varied: Morisot participated in seven, Cassatt in four, Bracquemond\nin three, and Gonzalès did not participate.[50][51]\n\nThe critics of the time lumped these four together without regard to their personal styles,\ntechniques,  or  subject  matter.[52]  Critics  viewing  their  works  at  the  exhibitions  often\nattempted  to  acknowledge  the  women  artists'  talents  but  circumscribed  them  within  a\nlimited  notion  of  femininity.[53] Arguing  for  the  suitability  of  Impressionist  technique  to\nwomen's manner of perception, Parisian critic S.C. de Soissons wrote:\n\nOne  can  understand  that  women  have  no  originality  of  thought,  and  that\nliterature and music have no feminine character; but surely women know how\nto observe, and what they see is quite different from that which men see, and\nthe art which they put in their gestures, in their toilet, in the decoration of their\nenvironment  is  sufficient  to  give  is  the  idea  of  an  instinctive,  of  a  peculiar\ngenius which resides in each one of them.[54]\n\nWhile  Impressionism  legitimized  the  domestic  social  life  as  subject  matter,  of  which\nwomen  had  intimate  knowledge,  it  also  tended  to  limit  them  to  that  subject  matter.\nPortrayals of often-identifiable sitters in domestic settings, which could offer commissions,\nwere  dominant  in  the  exhibitions.[55]  The  subjects  of  the  paintings  were  often  women\n\nMary Cassatt, Young Girl at\na Window, 1885, oil on\ncanvas, National Gallery of\nArt, Washington, D.C.\n\n\finteracting with their environment by either their gaze or movement. Cassatt, in particular, was aware of her placement of\nsubjects:  she  kept  her  predominantly  female  figures  from  objectification  and  cliche;  when  they  are  not  reading,  they\nconverse, sew, drink tea, and when they are inactive, they seem lost in thought.[56]\n\nThe women Impressionists, like their male counterparts, were striving for \"truth\", for new ways of seeing and new painting\ntechniques; each artist had an individual painting style.[57] Women Impressionists, particularly Morisot and Cassatt, were\nconscious of the balance of power between women and objects in their paintings – the bourgeois women depicted are not\ndefined by decorative objects, but instead, interact with and dominate the things with which they live.[58] There are many\nsimilarities in their depictions of women who seem both at ease and subtly confined.[59] Gonzalès' Box at the Italian Opera\ndepicts a woman staring into the distance, at ease in a social sphere but confined by the box and the man standing next to\nher. Cassatt's painting Young Girl at a Window is brighter in color but remains constrained by the canvas edge as she looks\nout the window.\n\nDespite their success in their ability to have a career and Impressionism's demise\nattributed  to  its  allegedly  feminine  characteristics—its  sensuality,  dependence  on\nsensation, physicality, and fluidity—the four women artists, and other, lesser-known\nwomen Impressionists, were largely omitted from art historical textbooks covering\nImpressionist  artists  until  Tamar  Garb's  Women  Impressionists  published  in\n1986.[60]  For  example,  Impressionism  by  Jean  Leymarie,  published  in  1955\nincluded no information on any women Impressionists.\n\nPainter  Androniqi  Zengo  Antoniu  is  co-credited  with  the  introduction  of\nimpressionism to Albania.[61]\n\nEva Gonzalès, Une Loge aux\nItaliens, or, Box at the Italian Opera,\nc. 1874, oil on canvas, Musée\nd'Orsay, Paris\n\nProminent Impressionists\nThe central figures in the development of Impressionism in France,[62][63] listed alphabetically, were:\n\nFrédéric Bazille (1841–1870), who only posthumously participated in the Impressionist exhibitions\nGustave Caillebotte (1848–1894), who, younger than the others, joined forces with them in the mid-1870s\nMary Cassatt (1844–1926), American-born, she lived in Paris and participated in four Impressionist\nexhibitions\nPaul Cézanne (1839–1906), although he later broke away from the Impressionists\nEdgar Degas (1834–1917), who despised the term Impressionist\nArmand Guillaumin (1841–1927)\nÉdouard Manet (1832–1883), who did not participate in any of the Impressionist exhibitions[64]\nClaude Monet (1840–1926), the most prolific of the Impressionists and the one who embodies their\naesthetic most obviously[65]\nBerthe Morisot (1841–1895) who participated in all Impressionist exhibitions except in 1879\nCamille Pissarro (1830–1903), who was the only artist to participate in all eight Impressionist exhibitions.[66]\nPierre-Auguste Renoir (1841–1919), who participated in Impressionist exhibitions in 1874, 1876, 1877 and\n1882\n\n\fAlfred Sisley (1839–1899)\n\nTimeline: lives of the Impressionists\n\nThe Impressionists\n\nGallery\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFrédéric Bazille, Paysage au bord\ndu Lez, 1870, Minneapolis Institute\nof Art\n\nAlfred Sisley, Bridge at Villeneuve-\nla-Garenne, 1872, Metropolitan\nMuseum of Art\n\nBerthe Morisot, The Cradle, 1872,\nMusée d'Orsay\n\nArmand Guillaumin, Sunset at Ivry\n(Soleil couchant à Ivry), 1873,\nMusée d'Orsay\n\nÉdouard Manet, Boating, 1874,\nMetropolitan Museum of Art\n\nCatalogue cover from the First\nImpressionist Exhibition, 1874\n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAlfred Sisley, La Seine au Point du\njour, 1877, Museum of modern art\nAndré Malraux - MuMa, Le Havre\n\nÉdouard Manet, The Plum, 1878,\nNational Gallery of Art,\nWashington, D.C.\n\nClaude Monet, La Falaise à\nFécamp, 1881, Aberdeen Art\nGallery\n\nÉdouard Manet, A Bar at the\nFolies-Bergère (Un Bar aux Folies-\nBergère), 1882, Courtauld Institute\nof Art\n\nEdgar Degas, After the Bath,\nWoman Drying Herself, c. 1884–\n1886 (reworked between 1890 and\n1900), MuMa, Le Havre\n\nEdgar Degas, L'Absinthe, 1876,\nMusée d'Orsay, Paris\n\nEdgar Degas, Dancer Taking a\nBow (The Prima Ballerina), 1878,\nGetty Center, Los Angeles\n\nEdgar Degas, Woman in the Bath,\n1886, Hill–Stead Museum,\nFarmington, Connecticut\n\nEdgar Degas, Dancers at The Bar,\n1888, The Phillips Collection,\nWashington, D.C.\n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGustave Caillebotte, Paris Street;\nRainy Day, 1877, Art Institute of\nChicago\n\nPierre-Auguste Renoir, La\nParisienne, 1874, National\nMuseum Cardiff\n\nPierre-Auguste Renoir, Portrait of\nIrène Cahen d'Anvers (La Petite\nIrène), 1880, Foundation E.G.\nBührle, Zürich\n\nPierre-Auguste Renoir, Two Sisters\n(On the Terrace), 1881, Art Institute\nof Chicago\n\nPierre-Auguste Renoir, Girl with a\nHoop, 1885, National Gallery of Art,\nWashington, D.C.\n\nCamille Pissarro, Washerwoman,\nStudy, 1880.

Originally from the school of Corot, Vignon\nwas a friend of Camille Pissarro, whose influence is\nevident  in  his  impressionist  style  after  the  late\n1870s,  and  a  friend  of  post-impressionist  Vincent\nvan Gogh.\n\nVictor Alfred Paul Vignon, Woman in\na Vineyard, c. 1880, Van Gogh\nMuseum\n\nThere were several other close associates of the Impressionists who adopted their methods\nto  some  degree.  These  include  Jean-Louis  Forain,  who  participated  in  Impressionist\nexhibitions  in  1879,  1880,  1881  and  1886,[67]  and  Giuseppe  De  Nittis,  an  Italian  artist\nliving in Paris who participated in the first Impressionist exhibit at the invitation of Degas,\nalthough  the  other  Impressionists  disparaged  his  work.[68]  Federico  Zandomeneghi  was\nanother Italian friend of Degas who showed with the Impressionists. Eva Gonzalès was a\nfollower of Manet who did not exhibit with the group.\n\nJames Abbott McNeill\nWhistler, Nocturne in Black\nand Gold: The Falling\nRocket, 1874, Detroit\nInstitute of Arts\n\n\fJames Abbott McNeill Whistler was an American-born painter who played a part in Impressionism although he did not join\nthe group and preferred grayed colours. Walter Sickert, an English artist, was initially a follower of Whistler, and later an\nimportant disciple of Degas. He did not exhibit with the Impressionists. In 1904, the artist and writer Wynford Dewhurst\nwrote  the  first  important  study  of  the  French  painters  published  in  English,  Impressionist  Painting:  its  genesis  and\ndevelopment, which did much to popularize Impressionism in Great Britain.\n\nBy the early 1880s, Impressionist methods were affecting, at least superficially, the art of the Salon. Fashionable painters\nsuch as Jean Béraud and Henri Gervex found critical and financial success by brightening their palettes while retaining the\nsmooth finish expected of Salon art.[69] Works by these artists are sometimes casually referred to as Impressionism, despite\ntheir remoteness from Impressionist practice.\n\nThe influence of the French Impressionists lasted long after most of them had died. Artists like J.D. Kirszenbaum were\nborrowing Impressionist techniques throughout the twentieth century.\n\nBeyond France\n\nAs the influence of Impressionism spread beyond France, artists, too numerous to\nlist, became identified as practitioners of the new style. Some of the more important\nexamples are:\n\nThe Girl with Peaches (1887,\nTretyakov Gallery) by Valentin Serov\n\nThe American Impressionists, including Mary Cassatt, William Merritt\nChase, Frederick Carl Frieseke, Childe Hassam, Willard Metcalf, Lilla\nCabot Perry, Theodore Robinson, Edmund Charles Tarbell, John Henry\nTwachtman, Catherine Wiley and J. Alden Weir.\nThe Australian Impressionists, including Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton,\nWalter Withers, Charles Conder, Frederick McCubbin and E. Phillips Fox\n(who were prominent members of the Heidelberg School), and John\nRussell, a friend of Van Gogh, Rodin, Monet and Matisse.\nThe Amsterdam Impressionists in the Netherlands, including George\nHendrik Breitner, Isaac Israëls, Willem Bastiaan Tholen, Willem de\nZwart, Willem Witsen and Jan Toorop.\nThe California Impressionists, including William Wendt, Guy Rose, Alson\nClark, Donna N.

Pierre\nAdolphe Valette, who was born in France but who worked in\nManchester, was the tutor of L. S.

He created as many as 150 sculptures during his\nlifetime.  Degas  preferred  the  medium  of  wax  for  his  sculptures  because  it  allowed  him  to  make\nchanges, start over, and further explore the modelling process.[73] Only one of Degas's sculptures,\nLittle  Dancer  of  Fourteen  Years,  was  exhibited  in  his  lifetime,  which  was  exhibited  at  the  Sixth\nImpressionist  Exhibition  in  1881.  Little  Dancer  proved  to  be  controversial  with  critics.  Some\nconsidered Degas to have overthrown sculptural traditions in the same way that Impressionism had\noverthrown the traditions of painting. Others found it to be ugly. [74] Following the Degas's death in\n1917, his heirs authorized bronze castings from 73 of the artist's sculptures.[75]\n\nThe  sculptor  Auguste  Rodin  is  sometimes  called  an  Impressionist  for  the  way  he  used  roughly\nmodeled  surfaces  to  suggest  transient  light  effects.[76] The  sculptor  Medardo  Rosso  has  also  been\ncalled an Impressionist.[77]\n\nSome Russian artists created Impressionistic sculptures of animals in order to break away from old\nworld concepts. Their works have been described as endowing birds and beasts with new spiritual\ncharacteristics.[78]\n\nEdgar Degas's\nLittle Dancer of\nFourteen Years at\nthe National\nGallery of Art,\nWashington, D.C.\n\nPhotography and film\nWhile his photographs are less known than his paintings or his sculptures, Edgar Degas also pursued photography later in\nhis life. His photographs were never exhibited during his lifetime, and not much attention was given to them following his\ndeath. It was not until the late 20th century that scholars started to take interest in Degas's photographs.[79]\n\nPictorialist  photographers,  whose  work  is  characterized  by  soft  focus  and  atmospheric  effects,  have  also  been  called\nImpressionists. These Impressionist photographers used various techniques such as photographing subjects out of focus,\nusing soft focus lenses or pinhole lenses, and manipulating the gum bichromate process to create images that resembled\nImpressionist paintings.[80]\n\nFrench Impressionist Cinema is a term applied to a loosely defined group of films and filmmakers in France from 1919 to\n1929, although these years are debatable. French Impressionist filmmakers include Abel Gance, Jean Epstein, Germaine\nDulac, Marcel L'Herbier, Louis Delluc, and Dmitry Kirsanoff.\n\nMusic\n\nClair de Lune (5:04)\n\n\fComposed by Claude Debussy in 1890, performed by Laurens Goedhart in 2011.\n\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\n\nMusical  Impressionism  is  the  name  given  to  a  movement  in  European  classical\nmusic that arose in the late 19th century and continued into the middle of the 20th\ncentury.  Originating  in  France,  musical  Impressionism  is  characterized  by\nsuggestion and atmosphere, and eschews the emotional excesses of the Romantic\nera. Impressionist composers favoured short forms such as the nocturne, arabesque,\nand  prelude,  and  often  explored  uncommon  scales  such  as  the  whole  tone  scale.\nPerhaps  the  most  notable  innovations  of  Impressionist  composers  were  the\nintroduction  of  major  7th  chords  and  the  extension  of  chord  structures  in  3rds  to\nfive- and six-part harmonies.\n\nThe  influence  of  visual  Impressionism  on  its  musical  counterpart  is  debatable.\nClaude  Debussy  and  Maurice  Ravel  are  generally  considered  the  greatest\nImpressionist composers, but Debussy disavowed the term, calling it the invention\nof critics. Erik Satie was also considered in this category, though his approach was\nregarded as less serious, more musical novelty in nature.\n\nClaude Monet, Water Lilies, 1916,\nNational Museum of Western Art,\nTokyo\n\nPaul  Dukas  is  another  French  composer  sometimes  considered  an  Impressionist,  but  his  style  is  perhaps  more  closely\naligned to the late Romanticists. Musical Impressionism beyond France includes the work of such composers as Ottorino\nRespighi (Italy), Ralph Vaughan Williams, Cyril Scott, and John Ireland (England), Manuel De Falla and Isaac Albeniz\n(Spain), and Charles Griffes (America).\n\nAmerican Impressionist music differs from European Impressionist music, and these differences are mainly reflected in\nCharles Griffith's poetry of flute and orchestral music. He is also the most prolific Impressionist composer in the United\nStates.[81]\n\nLiterature\nThe term Impressionism has also been used to describe works of literature in which a few select details suffice to convey\nthe sensory impressions of an incident or scene. Impressionist literature is closely related to Symbolism, with its major\nexemplars being Baudelaire, Mallarmé, Rimbaud, and Verlaine. Authors such as Virginia Woolf, D.H. Lawrence, Henry\nJames, and Joseph Conrad have written works that are Impressionistic in the way that they describe, rather than interpret,\nthe impressions, sensations and emotions that constitute a character's mental life. Some literary scholars, such as John G.\nPeters, believe literary Impressionism is better defined by its philosophical stance than by any supposed relationship with\nImpressionist painting.[82]\n\nPost-Impressionism\n\nDuring the 1880s several artists began to develop different precepts for the use of\ncolour, pattern, form, and line, derived from the Impressionist example: Vincent van\nGogh, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. These artists\nwere  slightly  younger  than  the  Impressionists,  and  their  work  is  known  as  post-\nImpressionism.  Post-Impressionist  artists  reacted  against \nthe  Impressionists'\nconcern  with  realistically  reproducing  the  optical  sensations  of  light  and  colour;\nthey turned instead toward symbolic content and the expression of emotion.[83]\n\nCamille Pissarro, Children on a\nFarm, 1887\n\nPost-Impressionism  prefigured  the  characteristics  of  Futurism  and  Cubism,\nreflecting  the  change  of  attitude  towards  art  in  European  society.[84]  Some  of  the  original  Impressionist  artists  also\nventured into this new territory; Camille Pissarro briefly painted in a pointillist manner, and even Monet abandoned strict\nplein  air  painting.  Paul  Cézanne,  who  participated  in  the  first  and  third  Impressionist  exhibitions,  developed  a  highly\n\n0:000:00\n\n/ 0:00\n/ 0:00\n\n\findividual vision emphasising pictorial structure, and he is more often called a post-Impressionist. Although these cases\nillustrate  the  difficulty  of  assigning  labels,  the  work  of  the  original  Impressionist  painters  may,  by  definition,  be\ncategorised as Impressionism.\n\n \n\n \n\nGeorges Seurat, A Sunday\nAfternoon on the Island of\nLa Grande Jatte, 1884–\n1886, The Art Institute of\nChicago\n\nVincent van Gogh,\nCypresses, 1889,\nMetropolitan Museum of Art\n\nPaul Gauguin, The Midday\nNap, 1894, Metropolitan\nMuseum of Art\n\nExpressionism, a reaction to Impressionism\nLuminism (Impressionism)\nCantonese school of painting, influenced by Impressionism\nLes XX\n\nPaul Cézanne, The Card\nPlayers, 1894–1895,\nMusée d'Orsay, Paris\n\nSee also\n\nArt periods\nHistory of Painting\nWestern Painting\n\nGeneral:\n\nNotes\n\na.
