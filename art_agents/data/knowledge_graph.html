oil, celebrated for its ability to create depth, richness of color, and intricate textures in artworks. This medium has been employed by numerous renowned artists, including Berthe Morisot, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Mary Cassatt, and Edgar Degas, among others.\n\nMorisot utilized oil in her painting *Summer\u0027s Day*, which highlights the unique blending of colors and textures possible with this medium. Renoir showcased the depth and richness that oil paints can achieve in works such as *By the Seashore* and *Dance at Bougival*, where the medium was crucial in creating vibrant colors and textures. Similarly, Cassatt\u0027s *The Boating Party* exemplified the richness and textural capabilities of oil paints.\n\nThe versatility of oil as a painting medium has led to its use in many significant artworks, such as in Sargent\u0027s impressionist piece *Reapers Resting in a Wheat Field*, Degas\u0027s *Comte Le Pic and his Sons*, and Monet\u0027s *Rough Sea at Etretat*. Each of these works demonstrates the distinctive qualities of oil paint, from its ability to achieve luminosity and depth to its role in enhancing color vibrancy.\n\nOther notable works that utilized oil include Manet\u0027s *Le Suicid\u00e9*, *Self-Portrait with a Palette*, and *A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re*, where the medium\u0027s richness and versatility were paramount. Furthermore, works like Monet\u2019s *The Magpie* and Renoir\u0027s *The Large Bathers* illustrate how oil paint can be manipulated to create desired textural outcomes, contributing significantly to the Impressionist style.\n\nOverall, oil paint stands out as a fundamental medium in art history, embraced for its rich colors, depth of application, and capability for detailed brushwork, influencing the works of many legendary artists and shaping the evolution of painting techniques.", "entity_type": "\"MATERIAL\"", "id": "\"OIL\"", "label": "\"OIL\"", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "source_id":

He tackled controversial subjects, as seen in pieces like \"Le Suicid\u00e9,\" and was influential in the development of Impressionism through his late impressionistic works, self-portraits, and oil
