    "### Overview\n",
    "For knowledge retrieval, this tutorial uses [LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG) which is knowledge graph based RAG implementation. Compared to GraphRAG, LightRAG is more accurate for single topic datasets, and uses 1,000x less tokens for retrieval. Furthermore, documents can be added to LightRAG incrementally without rebuilding the knowledge graph. See the full results in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05779).\n",

From the vibrant landscapes of Claude Monet to the poignant social commentaries of Édouard Manet, we traversed a rich landscape of creativity and expression.\\n\\n**1. The Grand Canal 03** by Claude Monet captures the ethereal beauty of Venice, showcasing Monet's mastery of light and color as he paints the changing reflections on the water. This series exemplifies his exploration of natural light, inviting viewers to experience the serene yet dynamic environment of the canal.\\n\\n**2. A Girl with a Watering Can** by Pierre-Auguste Renoir portrays a tender moment in a garden setting, depicting Mademoiselle Leclere in a cheerful blue dress as she engages in a simple, everyday activity. Renoir’s impressionistic style vividly brings this scene to life through fluid brushwork and rich colors.\\n\\n**3. Spring (Study of Jeanne Demarsy)** by Édouard Manet embodies contemporary themes reflected in the depiction of the actress Jeanne DeMarsy, captured in a striking floral dress amid a lush backdrop. This painting is a testament to Manet’s exploration of modern femininity and fashion, blending traditional portraiture with modern elements.\\n\\n**4. Summer's Day** by Berthe Morisot features two women in a rowboat painted with a delicate touch, showcasing her distinctive style that beautifully intertwines color and light. Morisot’s artwork stands out for its feminine perspective and capturing the joys of leisure in nature.\\n\\n**5. The Boating Party** by Mary Cassatt offers an intimate glimpse into the family dynamic through the depiction of a mother and child on a sailboat, emphasizing maternal themes in her work. This piece is notable for its composition and the interplay of figures, reflecting Cassatt’s deep understanding of women’s experiences.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this tour illuminated the profound themes of light, fleeting moments of beauty, and the complexity of modern life that these artists so eloquently captured in their works.
