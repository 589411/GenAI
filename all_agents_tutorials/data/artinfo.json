It depicts a seemingly disheartened swagman, sitting by a campfire sadly brooding over his misfortune. According to an 1889 review, \"The face tells of hardships, keen and blighting in their influence, but there is a nonchalant and slightly cynical expression, which proclaims the absence of all self-pity ... McCubbin's picture is thoroughly Australian in spirit.\" The surrounding bush is painted in subdued tones, reflecting his somber and contemplative mood.\r The artist's model was Louis Abrahams, a friend and successful tobaccanist in Melbourne who earlier supplied the cigar box lids for the famous 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition. The scene was staged near the Box Hill artists' camp outside Melbourne, but it is thought that McCubbin would have made additional studies of Abrahams under studio conditions.\r The painting was owned by William Fergusson up to 1986 until it was purchased by the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth.\n", "\nArtist: Frederick McCubbin\nArtwork Name: The pioneer\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frederick-mccubbin/the-pioneer-1904\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Pioneer is a 1904 painting by Australian artist Frederick McCubbin. The painting is a triptych; the three panels tell a story of a free selector and his family making a life in the Australian bush. It is widely considered one of the masterpieces of Australian art.\r The painting is part of the National Gallery of Victoria's Australian art collection and exhibited in the Ian Potter Centre in Federation Square in Melbourne.\r The three panels of the triptych tell a story of a free selector, a farmer who has chosen some land to clear and farm, and his family. The story is ambiguous, like many of McCubbin's other works and McCubbin chose not to respond when controversy broke out over the \"correct\" meaning.\r The left panel shows the selector and his wife settling on their selection; in the foreground the woman is deep in thought. In the centre panel, the baby in the woman's arms indicates that some time has elapsed. A cottage, the family home, can be seen in a clearing through the trees. The right panel shows a young man standing over a grave. A city is visible in the background, again indicating that time has passed. It is unclear if the young man is the baby from the centre panel or a stranger stumbling across the grave.\r McCubbin painted the work en plein air near Fontainebleau \u2014 his home in Mount Macedon, northwest of Melbourne \u2014 using specially dug trenches to lower the canvas. The view is across a neighbouring property owned by William Peter McGregor, the second chairman of Broken Hill Proprietary Ltd. The cottage in the middle panel was the home of the manager of McGregor's bull stud. McCubbin's wife Annie and a local sawyer Patrick \"Paddy\" Watson were the models for the left panel, with Watson also the model for the youth in the right panel. The model for the centre panel was a young commercial painter, James Edward with Annie again posing as the woman. The baby was Jimmy Watson, Patrick's nephew.\r A study of the materials and technique used in the painting revealed that\u2014to add \"luminosity and texture\"\u2014McCubbin covered the ground in the centre panel with a further layer of lead white; the brushmarks in the stiffer lead white can be seen through the later layers in raking light. Raking light also shows that a palette knife has been used in some places to apply paint to the surface. The painting is still displayed in its original frame; the frame may have been resurfaced.\r The painting was first exhibited in a one-man show in 1904 at the Melbourne Athenaeum gallery but did not find a buyer. Walter Withers, a friend of McCubbin's, suggested that McCubbin add a view of Melbourne in the background of the right panel, which he did. The National Gallery of Victoria purchased the painting the following year for 367 pounds and 10 shillings, using funds from the Felton Bequest.\r The painting has been described as \"self-consciously nationalistic; proud of the prosperity of the fine city seen in the background - Its mood of quiet optimism is unqualified.\"\n", "\nArtist: Tom Roberts\nArtwork Name: The Golden Fleece\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-roberts/the-golden-fleece-1894\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Golden Fleece, originally known as Shearing at Newstead, is an 1894 painting by the Australian artist Tom Roberts. The painting depicts sheep shearers plying their trade in a timber shearing shed at Newstead North, a sheep station near Inverell on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales. The same shed is depicted in another of Roberts' works, Shearing Shed, Newstead (1894).\r The painting was originally titled Shearing at Newstead but was renamed The Golden Fleece after the Golden Fleece of Greek mythology to honour the wool industry and the nobility of the shearers. This was in keeping with Roberts' conscious idealisation of the Australian pastoral worker and landscape.\r The painting, said to be \"an icon of Australian art\", is part of the collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales.\n", "\nArtist: Gustav Klimt\nArtwork Name: Judith and the Head of Holofernes\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustav-klimt/judith-and-holopherne-1901\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJudith and the Head of Holofernes (also known as Judith I)  is an oil painting by Gustav Klimt created in 1901. It depicts the biblical character of Judith holding the severed head of Holofernes.\r When Klimt tackles the biblical theme of Judith, the historical course of art has already codified its main interpretation and preferential representation. In fact, many paintings exist, describing the episode in a heroic manner, especially expressing Judith's courage and her virtuous nature. Judith appears as God's instrument of salvation, but the violence of her action cannot be denied and is dramatically shown in Caravaggio's rendering, as well as those of Gentileschi and Bigot. Other representations have chosen the subsequent moment, when a dazed Judith holds Holofernes' severed head, as Moreau and Allori anticipate in their suggestive mythological paintings.\r Klimt deliberately ignores any narrative reference whatsoever, and concentrates his pictorial rendering solely on to Judith, so much so that he cuts off Holofernes' head at the right margin. And there is no trace of bloodied sword, as if the heroine would have used a different weapon: an omission that legitimates association with Salome. The moment preceding the killing \u2014 the seduction of Nebuchadnezzar's general \u2014 seems to coalesce with the conclusive part of the story.\r Judith I reveals a curious symbolic and compositional consonance with The Sin by Franz Stuck: the temptation illustrated by the German painter becomes the model for Klimt's femme fatale by suggesting the posture of the disrobed and evanescent body as focal piece of the canvas, as well as the facial set. Judith's force originates from the close-up and the solidity of posture, rendered by the orthogonal projection of lines: to the body's verticality (and that of Holofernes') corresponds the horizontal parallels in the lower margin: those of the arm, the shoulders joined by the collier, and finally the hair base. Judith was the biblical heroine who seduced and then decapitated General Holofernes in order to save her home city of Bethulia from destruction by the enemy, the Assyrian army.\r Judith's face exudes a mixed charge of voluptuousness and perversion. Its traits are transfigured so as to obtain the greatest degree of intensity and seduction, which Klimt achieves by placing the woman on an unattainable plane. Notwithstanding the alteration of features, one can recognise Klimt's friend and maybe lover, Viennese socialite, Adele Bloch-Bauer, the subject of another two portraits respectively done in 1907 and 1912, and also painted in the Pallas Athena. The slightly lifted head has a sense of pride, whereas her visage is languid and sensual, with parted lips in between defiance and seduction. Franz A. J. Szabo describes it best as a, \u201c[symbol of] triumph of the erotic feminine principle over the aggressive masculine one.\u201d Her half-closed gaze, which also ties into an expression of pleasure, directly confronts the viewer of all this. In 1903, author and critic Felix Salten describes Judith\u2019s expression as one \u201cwith a sultry fire in her dark glances, cruelty in the lines of her mouth, and nostrils trembling with passion. Mysterious forces seem to be slumbering within this enticing female\u2026\u201d Although Judith had typically been interpreted as the pious widow simply fulfilling a higher duty, in Judith I she is a paradigm of the femme fatale Klimt repeatedly portrayed in his work. The contrast between the black hair and the golden luminosity of the background enhance elegance and exaltation. The fashionable hairdo is emphasized by the stylised motifs of the trees fanning on the sides. Her disheveled dark green, semi-sheer garment, giving the viewer a view of nearly bare torso, alludes to the fact that Judith beguiled the general Holofernes before decapitating him.\n", "\nArtist: Gustav Klimt\nArtwork Name: Hope I\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustav-klimt/hope-i\n\nWikipedia Article:\nHope I is an oil painting created by Gustav Klimt in 1903. It is 189\u00a0cm x 67\u00a0cm and currently located in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa. The main subject of this work is a pregnant, nude female. She is holding her hands together above her stomach and close to her chest. She gazes directly at the viewer and has a great mass of hair with a crown of forget-me-not flowers placed on her head. The scene is beautiful upon first glance but once the viewer\u2019s eyes move to the background, deathlike figures become noticeably present.\r In the years before this painting was made, it was uncommon to show pregnancy in art in Western art and Gustav Klimt was one of the first artists who blatantly portrayed a nude pregnant female in a powerful manner. Klimt did not show this work to the public until the Second Vienna Kunstschau in 1909. The themes present in this painting are contradictory, such as birth and death. The dark figures in the background swirl around the nude female seeming to blend the idea of life, death, and rebirth.\r Not only does this painting show deathly figures in the background, but there also is a sea monster standing towards the left. The viewer can notice the monster\u2019s teeth along with its claw like hand that is located directly across from the woman\u2019s stomach and pelvic region. The sea monster has a large tail that wraps around the feet of the woman as if trying to capture her and continues out of the frame. Also, among the three sickly looking figures in the background, there is a skull located directly above the woman\u2019s head. This skull is attached to a blue body with varying shapes, lines, and colors. The skull represents death and decay while the three figures in the background symbolise disease, old age, and madness.\r The skull behind the woman could be a reference to the art historical tradition of memento mori, which serves as a reminder that death is unavoidable. This tradition focuses on the idea that you can be thriving with life (such as the nude woman is) but tomorrow could bring the possibility of death. In Hope I the theme of life, death, and rebirth relate to the similar themes behind the tradition of memento mori. In art, memento mori is often represented by a skull, which we see present in the background of Hope I.\r The model for this painting was Herma, one of Gustav Klimt\u2019s favorite models. Klimt described Herma as \u201chaving a backside more beautiful and more intelligent than the faces of many other models.\u201d  Hope I was created unexpectedly; one day Herma was supposed to model for Klimt and did not show up. He became concerned and eventually sent someone to see if she was sick. The response that Klimt received was that Herma was not sick, but pregnant. Klimt demanded she come into work regardless of her being pregnant and upon seeing her he decided to make her the model for Hope I. It is believed that Klimt had sexual relations with nearly all his models. However, it is not known whether or not any of the pregnancies depicted in his paintings, such as Herma\u2019s, were his offspring.\n", "\nArtist: Gustav Klimt\nArtwork Name: The Three Ages of Woman\nArtwork Genre: symbolic painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustav-klimt/the-three-ages-of-woman-1905\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Three Ages of Woman is a painting by Gustav Klimt, symbolist painter and one of the most prominent members of the Vienna Secession movement. that was completed in Austria in 1905.\r The work features three women in varying stages of age, symbolizing the cycle of life. The three women are central on the canvas and are the focal point of the work. The background has a lack of depth, making it look very two dimensional. The colors are neutral and create a restful effect. Klimt's common use of colorful motifs is also evident in this work. There are two vertical auras that the women are in. The two younger women are in a blue aura that has a fluid pattern of cool colors. The old woman is in an aura by herself, and it is filled with a less fluid pattern with more distinct separations in the design. The colors of this aura are warm, earthy tones that contrast with the cool colors of the other aura. The woman and the auras overlap slightly. The leg of the young woman goes behind the left aura and the old woman's head comes in front of the right aura.\r The youngest figure, a child, is connected to the young woman who is her mother. They are the only two touching, they also have sheer blue fabric draped down their legs. Both of these women also have their eyes closed. The young woman has flowers around her head which represent spring. Her hair is bright an voluminous, contrasting with that of the old woman who is separated from the other two women. Her head is turned away and facing down. The effects of old age are obvious through her sagging skin, bloated belly, and prominent veins. She is also unlike the other two in the fact that both of her feet are shown. This was done so the viewer can see the ugliness of her age in its entirety.\r The artists, Gustav Klimt, was a prominent Austrian painter who was born in 1862. He worked as an apprentice of Ferdinand Laufberger during the early part of his art career. Later he was a founding member and the first president of the Vienna Secession from 1897 to 1903. He and fellow artist formed the secession after leaving K\u00fcnstlerhaus, or the Corporation of Austrian Artists due to differences in views. The Secession held many exhibitions and also founded a magazine titled Ver Sacrum, which translates as sacred spring. Here they published many writers and artists all while sharing the views of the Vienna Secession. Klimt left the Vienna Secession in 1905, the same year that The Three Ages of Woman was completed.\r This is an oil on canvas painting that measures 180 by 180 centimeters. It shows signs of an impasto painting technique that was common of Klimt's work. His painting methods included mixing drying solvents into the paint to make sure there was no unwanted glossy appearance. He also would retouch works, which limited how many paintings he was able to create per year. The Three Ages of Woman falls into Klimt's Golden Period which includes other works such as The Kiss. This period was characterized by high ornamentation and the use of gold and metallic paints. This work also suggest that it is part of the Art Nouveau movement due to the time period and the decorative elements. The Painting is located in Rome at the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna.\n", "\nArtist: Gustav Klimt\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustav-klimt/portrait-of-adele-bloch-bauer-i-1907-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I (also called The Lady in Gold or The Woman in Gold) is a painting by Gustav Klimt, completed between 1903 and 1907. The portrait was commissioned by the sitter's husband, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer\u00a0(de), a Jewish banker and sugar producer. The painting was stolen by the Nazis in 1941 and displayed at the \u00d6sterreichische Galerie Belvedere.\r In 2006, following eight years of effort by the Bloch-Bauer heirs, the painting was returned to the family; it was sold the same year for $135\u00a0million, at the time a record price for a painting.\r The portrait is the final and most fully representative work of Klimt's golden phase. It was the first of two depictions of Adele by Klimt\u2014the second was completed in 1912; these were two of several works by the artist that the family owned. Adele died in 1925; her will asked that the artworks by Klimt were to be left to the Galerie Belvedere, although these belonged to Ferdinand, not her. Following the Anschluss of Austria by Nazi Germany, Ferdinand fled Vienna, and made his way to Switzerland, leaving behind much of his wealth, including his large art collection. The painting was stolen by the Nazis in 1941, along with the remainder of Ferdinand's assets, after a charge of tax evasion was made against him. The assets raised from the purported sales of artwork, property and his sugar business were offset against the tax claim. The lawyer acting on behalf of the German state gave the portrait to the Galerie Belvedere, claiming he was following the wishes Adele had made in her will. Ferdinand died in 1946; his will stated that his estate should go to his nephew and two nieces.\r In 1998 Hubertus Czernin, the Austrian investigative journalist, established that the Galerie Belvedere contained several works stolen from Jewish owners in the war, and that the gallery had refused to return the art to their original owners, or to acknowledge a theft had taken place. One of Ferdinand's nieces, Maria Altmann, hired the lawyer E. Randol Schoenberg to make a claim against the gallery for the return of five works by Klimt. After a seven year legal claim, which included a hearing in front of the Supreme Court of the United States, an arbitration committee in Vienna agreed that the painting, and others, had been stolen from the family and that it should be returned to Altmann. It was sold to the businessman and art collector Ronald Lauder, who placed the work in the Neue Galerie, the New York-based gallery he co-founded.\r Gustav Klimt was born in 1862 in Baumgarten, near Vienna in Austria-Hungary. He attended the Vienna School of Arts and Crafts (German:Kunstgewerbeschule Wien) before taking on commissions with his brother, Ernst, and a fellow-student Franz von Matsch from 1879. Over the next decade, alongside several private commissions for portraiture, they painted interior murals and ceilings in large public buildings, including the Burgtheater, the Kunsthistorisches Museum and the ceiling of the Great Hall at the University of Vienna.\n", "\nArtist: Gustav Klimt\nArtwork Name: Danae\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustav-klimt/danae-1908\n\nWikipedia Article:\nDana\u00eb is an oil painting by Gustav Klimt, created in 1907. An example of Symbolism, the canvas measures 77 x 83\u00a0cm, and is in the Galerie W\u00fcrthle in Vienna. Dana\u00eb was a popular subject in the early 1900s for many artists; she was used as the quintessential symbol of divine love, and transcendence.\r While imprisoned by her father, King of Argos, in a tower of bronze, Dana\u00eb was visited by Zeus, symbolized here as the golden rain flowing between her legs. It is apparent from the subject's face that she is aroused by the golden stream.\r In this work, she is curled in a royal purple veil which refers to her imperial lineage. Sometime after her celestial visitation she gave birth to a son, Perseus, who is cited later in Greek mythology for slaying the Gorgon Medusa and rescuing Andromeda.\r Many early portrayals of Dana\u00eb were erotic; other paintings completed in similar style are Klimt's Medicine (1900\u20131907), and Water Snakes (1904\u20131907).\n", "\nArtist: Gustav Klimt\nArtwork Name: Hope II\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustav-klimt/hope-ii-1908\n\nWikipedia Article:\nHope II (in German, Die Hoffnung II) is a painting by Gustav Klimt, made in 1907\u201308. It was the second of Klimt's works to focus on a pregnant woman, both depicting Herma, one of his favourite models. It was entitled Vision by Klimt, but has become known as Hope II after the earlier work Hope, which is now distinguished as Hope I. Hope II was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1978.\r Klimt painted the heavily pregnant Herma in Hope I in 1903, in which she was depicted naked. In Hope II, she is wearing a long dress or cloak decorated with geometric shapes. She has long brown hair and closed eyes, bowing hear head towards her bare breasts and burgeoning abdomen. An incongruous human skull appears attached to the front of her clothing \u2013 perhaps a sign of the dangers of labour, or possibly a memento mori (in Hope I, she is also accompanied by a skull and several deathlike figures). At the foot of the painting, three woman also bow their heads, as if praying or perhaps mourning.\r The square painting measures 110.5 by 110.5 centimetres (43.5\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a043.5\u00a0in). The women occupy the central third of the painting, with a darker gold-flecked background to either side. The woman's clothing, decorated with gold leaf like a Byzantine artwork and richly coloured and patterned, but flat like an Orthodox icon, contrasts with the delicately painted and contoured human faces and bare flesh, and also with the darker tones of the background.\r Hope II was exhibited at the first Vienna Kunstschau\u00a0(de) in 1908. Due to the scandalous nudity of its central figure, Hope I was not exhibited until the second Vienna Kunstschau the following year.\r The painting was acquired by Eugenie Primavesi\u00a0(de) before December 1914, and it was sold in the late 1930s by the Neue Galerie of Otto Kallir or his successor Vita K\u00fcnstler. It remained in private collections until 1978, when it was sold by Hans Barnas to the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York.\n", "\nArtist: Gustav Klimt\nArtwork Name: The Kiss\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustav-klimt/the-kiss-1908\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Kiss (in German Liebespaar, Lovers) is an oil painting, with added silver and gold leaf by the Austrian Symbolist painter Gustav Klimt, and was painted between 1907 and 1908 during the height of Klimt's \"Golden Period\". The painting depicts a couple embracing one another, their bodies entwined in elaborate robes decorated in a style influenced by the contemporary Art Nouveau style and the organic forms of the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. The painting hangs in the \u00d6sterreichische Galerie Belvedere museum in the Belvedere palace, Vienna, and is widely considered a masterpiece of the early modern period. It is an icon of the Jugendstil\u2014Viennese Art Nouveau\u2014and is considered Klimt's most popular work.\r Love, intimacy, and sexuality are common themes found in Gustav Klimt's works. The Stoclet Frieze and the Beethoven Frieze are such examples of Klimt's focus on romantic intimacy. Both works are precursors to The Kiss and feature the recurring motif of an embracing couple.\r It is thought that Klimt and his companion Emilie Fl\u00f6ge modeled for the work, but there is no evidence or record to prove this. Others suggest the female was the model known as 'Red Hilda'; she bears strong resemblance to the model in his Woman with feather boa, Goldfish and Dana\u00eb.\r Gustav Klimt depicts the couple locked in an intimate embrace against a gold, flat background. The two figures are situated at the edge of a patch of flowery meadow that ends under the woman's exposed feet. The man wears a robe printed with geometric patterns and subtle swirls. He wears a crown of vines while the woman wears a crown of flowers. She is shown in a flowing dress with floral patterns. The man's face is not shown to the audience and instead, his face is bent downward to press a kiss to the woman's cheek, and his hands are cradling the woman's face. Her eyes are closed, with one arm wrapped around the man's neck, the other clinging to the front of his robe, and her face is upturned to receive the man's kiss.\r The patterns in the painting suggests the style of Art Nouveau and the organic forms of the Arts and Crafts movement. At the same time, the background evokes the conflict between two- and three-dimensionality intrinsic to the work of Degas and other modernists. Paintings such as The Kiss are visual manifestations of fin-de-siecle spirit because they capture a decadence conveyed by opulent and sensuous images. The use of gold leaf recalls medieval \"gold-ground\" paintings, illuminated manuscripts, earlier mosaics, and the spiral patterns in the clothes recall Bronze Age art and the decorative tendrils seen in Western art since before classical times. The man's head ends very close to the top of the canvas, a departure from traditional Western canons that reflects the influence of Japanese prints, as does the painting's simplified composition.\r Klimt's use of gold was inspired by a trip he had made to Italy in 1903. When he visited Ravenna he saw the Byzantine mosaics in the Church of San Vitale. For Klimt, the flatness of the mosaics and their lack of perspective and depth only enhanced their golden brilliance, and he started to make unprecedented use of gold and silver leaf in his own work.\n", "\nArtist: Gustav Klimt\nArtwork Name: The Virgin\nArtwork Genre: symbolic painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustav-klimt/the-virgin-1913\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Maiden (Die Jungfrau) is a painting by the Austrian painter Gustav Klimt painted in year 1913.

It is created in an Art Nouveau (Modern) style by use of allegorical painting genre during Golden phase. The painting measures 178 by 198 centimeters and is now housed at the Leopold Museum in Vienna.\r This is one of Klimt\u2019s central themes, central also to his time and to his contemporaries among them Edvard Munch and Egon Schiele. Klimt makes of it a modern dance of death, but unlike Schiele, he introduces a note of hope and reconciliation, instead of feeling threatened by the figure of death, his human beings seem to disregard it. The imagination of the artist is focused no longer on physical union, but rather on the expectation that precedes it. Perhaps this new found serenity is rooted in Klimt\u2019s own awareness of aging and closeness to death.

He made numerous portraits for nobility and government officials. Josef Kriehuber left more than 3000 lithographs, with portraits of many people.  Josef Kriehuber was born in Vienna, Austria on 14 December 1800. He was first trained by his brother Johann Kriehuber, then studied at the Vienna Academy under Hubert Maurer, then moved to Galicia, where he devoted himself to horse painting. He worked as a lithographer for several Viennese publishing houses. With nearly 3,000 works, Josef Kriehuber was the most important portrait lithographer of the Viennese Biedermeier period.  Kriehuber is also noted for his studies of the Prater park. He taught at the Vienna Theresianum academy.  Kriehuber was only 13 years old when he went to the art-class in the Imperial Academy in Vienna. In 1818, he accompanied the prince Sanguszko as a drawing-master to Poland. In 1821 he returned to Vienna. To earn himself money for the course at the academy, and for the cost of living, he became one of the most industrious lithographic employees of the publishing company Trentsensky. In 1826, his first portraits using the new printing technique of lithography appear. In the next few decades, Kriehuber becomes the most sought-after and best-paid portraitist of Biedermeier Vienna. His success probably stems from the fact that he is a master of portraying men as more distinguished, and women as prettier, than they are in reality.  His works, an image of the Viennese society of this epoch, include nearly 3000 portrait-lithographs, along with a few hundred water-colours. There are but few well-known persons of that time who did not have their portrait made by Kriehuber. Names include: Francis I of Austria, F\u00fcrst von Metternich, Josef Radetzky, Franz Grillparzer, Johann Nestroy, Archduke Johann, Friedrich Halm, Friedrich Hebbel, Hammer-Purgstall, Franz Schubert, Anton Diabelli, Robert Schumann, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Carl Czerny, Franz Liszt, Sigismond Thalberg, Ole Bull, Niccol\u00f2 Paganini, Elias Parish Alvars, Fritz Reuter, Therese Krones, Fanny El\u00dfler, Archduke Karl Ludwig, Sophie of Austria, Marie-Louise of Austria, Johann Kaspar von Seiller, Hector Berlioz, Stephan Endlicher, Ignaz von Seyfried, Moritz Gottlieb Saphir, Carl von Ghega, Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, Ferdinand Maximilian von Austria.  In 1860 he was hailed as first artist awarded the Franz Joseph Order in Austria. With the advances of photography, however, commissions fell off; Kriehuber's last years were overshadowed by poverty. He died on 30 May 1876, in his native city of Vienna. His final resting place, now an honorary grave, is in Vienna's \"Zentralfriedhof\" (central cemetery).  Significant collections of his works are in the Albertina (Vienna), and in the portrait collection of the Austrian National Library in Vienna.

As he spent much of his time as a youngster drawing the scenes of his native town, his father sent him in 1836 to study at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. At the time the director was the painter Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Navez who had been a pupil of Jacques-Louis David.  Portaels studied at the Academie under Navez with other brilliant students such as Charles de Groux and Joseph Stallaert.  Navez also invited him to study in Navez' own studio, which enjoyed a great reputation at the time.  Around 1841 Portaels went to Paris to continue his studies. He enrolled at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. In his spare time, he studied the old masters in the Louvre and visited the Paris salons to seek inspiration from the new artistic trends in France. Orientalism was at the time coming into vogue. The exhibitions, galleries and salons of Paris showcased the recently acquired taste for the Orient. Portaels' artistic course was given a determining direction by this development. In Paris he also became a pupil of Paul Delaroche, a prominent French painter of historical scenes. Upon his return to Belgium, he won in 1842 the Grand Prix de Rome, i.e. the first prize in the Belgian Prix de Rome.  The financial reward connected to the prize allowed him to travel to Italy where he stayed in Venice, Florence and Rome. He continued to feel the pull of the Orient and travelled successively to Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Judea, Spain, Hungary and Norway. In Hungary he spent quite some time to study the typical traits of the Magyars and Romani people.  During his travels he was able to paint portraits of some prominent personalities such as the viceroy of Egypt.  On his return to Belgium in 1847 Portaels was appointed Director of the Academy in Ghent to succeed Henri van der Haert who had died.  He remained in this position for three years.  In 1849 he married Marie H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Navez, the daughter of his first teacher, Navez. The couple settled in Brussels in 1850. A son born in 1850 died soon after his birth. In 1851 he received the Grand Cordon in the Order of Leopold. When Navez resigned from the Brussels Academy, Portaels was asked to replace him. He declined, however, because he deemed the conditions offered to him not to be acceptable and he preferred to maintain his independence. Eug\u00e8ne Simonis was appointed director in his stead.  Portaels was admitted as a member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium in 1855.\n", "\nArtist: Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels\nArtwork Name: The Slave Market\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-francois-portaels/the-slave-market-1853\n\nWikipedia Article:\nA slave market is a place where slaves are bought and sold. These markets became a key phenomenon in the history of slavery.  In the Ottoman Empire during the mid-14th century, slaves were traded in special marketplaces called \"Esir\" or \"Yesir\" that were located in most towns and cities. It is said that Sultan Mehmed II \"the Conqueror\" established the first Ottoman slave market in Constantinople in the 1460s, probably where the former Byzantine slave market had stood. According to Nicolas de Nicolay, there were slaves of all ages and both sexes, they were displayed naked to be thoroughly checked by possible buyers.  In the early 18th century, the Crimean Khanate maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East, exporting about 2 million slaves from Russia and Poland-Lithuania over the period 1500\u20131700. Caffa (modern Feodosia) became one of the best-known and significant trading ports and slave markets.  In Somalia, the inhabiting Bantus are descended from Bantu groups that had settled in Southeast Africa after the initial expansion from Nigeria/Cameroon, and whose members were later captured and sold into the Arab slave trade.\r From 1800 to 1890, between 25,000\u201350,000 Bantu slaves are thought to have been sold from the slave market of Zanzibar to the Somali coast. Most of the slaves were from the Majindo, Makua, Nyasa, Yao, Zalama, Zaramo and Zigua ethnic groups of Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawi. Collectively, these Bantu groups are known as Mushunguli, which is a term taken from Mzigula, the Zigua tribe's word for \"people\" (the word holds multiple implied meanings including \"worker\", \"foreigner\", and \"slave\"). Bantu adult and children slaves (referred to collectively as jareer by their Somali masters) were purchased in the slave market exclusively to do undesirable work on plantation grounds.  Enslaved Africans were sold in the towns of the Arab World. In 1416, al-Maqrizi told how pilgrims coming from Takrur (near the Senegal River) had brought 1,700 slaves with them to Mecca. In North Africa, the main slave markets were in Morocco, Algiers, Tripoli and Cairo. Sales were held in public places or in souks.  Potential buyers made a careful examination of the \"merchandise\": they checked the state of health of a person who was often standing naked with wrists bound together. In Cairo, transactions involving eunuchs and concubines happened in private houses. Prices varied according to the slave's quality. Thomas Smee, the commander of the British research ship Ternate, visited such a market in Zanzibar in 1811 and gave a detailed description:  Among many other European slave markets, Genoa, and Venice were some well-known markets, their importance and demand growing after the great plague of the 14th century which decimated much of the European work force.The maritime town of Lagos, Portugal, was the first slave market created in Portugal for the sale of imported African slaves, the Mercado de Escravos, which opened in 1444. In 1441, the first slaves were brought to Portugal from northern Mauritania. Prince Henry the Navigator, major sponsor of the Portuguese African expeditions, as of any other merchandise, taxed one fifth of the selling price of the slaves imported to Portugal. By the year 1552 African slaves made up 10 percent of the population of Lisbon. In the second half of the 16th century, the Crown gave up the monopoly on slave trade and the focus of European trade in African slaves shifted from import to Europe to slave transports directly to tropical colonies in the Americas\u2014in the case of Portugal, especially Brazil. In the 15th century, one third of the slaves were resold to the African market in exchange of gold.\n", "\nArtist: Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Archduchess Carlotta in Brianza costume\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-francois-portaels/portrait-of-archduchess-carlotta-in-brianza-costume-1857\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  Charlotte of Belgium (7 June 1840\u00a0\u2013 19 January 1927) was a Belgian princess who became Empress of Mexico. In 1857 she married the Habsburg Archduke Maximilian, but feuded with the Empress Elisabeth in Vienna, and was glad when her husband was posted to Italy. At this time, he was selected by the Emperor Napoleon III as a figurehead for his proposed French empire in Mexico, and Charlotte overcame her husband\u2019s doubts about the plan. Maximilian and Charlotte (known by the Spanish \u2018Carlota\u2019) were duly crowned in Mexico City in 1864, but Napoleon was losing interest and withdrew support. Charlotte returned to Europe to try to change Napoleon\u2019s mind, but her failure seemed to affect her own mental stability, and she suffered wild delusions for the rest of her life. After her husband was deposed and executed by the Mexicans, she was looked after by members of the Belgian and Austrian monarchies. Charlotte is believed to have been the natural mother of the French general Maxime Weygand.  The only daughter of King Leopold I of the Belgians and Louise of Orl\u00e9ans, Charlotte was born at the Royal Castle of Laeken, Belgium. She was named after her father's first wife, Princess Charlotte of Wales.  Charlotte had three brothers: Louis-Philippe, who died in infancy; the future Leopold II of Belgium; and Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders. She was close to her maternal grandmother, Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies, Queen of the French, and the two regularly corresponded.  When Charlotte was ten years old, her mother, Queen Louise-Marie, died of tuberculosis and Charlotte was entrusted to the Countess of Hulst, a close family friend. Although young, the princess had her own household; but for a few weeks out of the year, Charlotte stayed in Claremont with Maria Amalia and the rest of her mother's family in exile.  It was rumored that, in 1866, Charlotte was having an affair with Belgian officer Colonel Alfred Van der Smissen\u00a0[nl] and that she gave birth to a son, Maxime Weygand, in Brussels on 21 January 1867. Weygand refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumor and his parentage remains uncertain. Weygand was a French military commander in both World Wars I and II.  In her youth, Charlotte resembled her mother, and was noted to be a beauty, possessing delicate features. Combined with her status as the only daughter of King Leopold, she was a desirable bride. On July 27, 1857, Charlotte married her second cousin Archduke Maximilian of Austria in Brussels, the idealistic younger brother of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Napoleon III gave Charlotte and her husband Maximilian a beautiful bisque bust of Charlotte as a wedding gift. In the Court of Vienna she was much prized by her mother-in-law, Princess Sophie, who saw in her the perfect example of a wife to an Austrian Archduke. This contributed to the strained relationship between Charlotte and Empress Elisabeth of Austria, wife of Franz Joseph, whom Sophie treated rather cruelly. It is said that Charlotte disliked the deep connection that existed between Elisabeth and Maximilian, who were confidantes and shared the same tastes for many things, especially because her sister-in-law was universally admired for her beauty and charms.\n", "\nArtist: Ford Madox Brown\nArtwork Name: The Last of England\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/ford-madox-brown/the-last-of-england-1860\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Last of England is an 1855 oil-on-panel painting by Ford Madox Brown depicting two emigrants leaving England to start a new life in Australia with their baby.\r Brown began the painting in 1852 inspired by the departure of his close friend, the Pre-Raphaelite sculptor, Thomas Woolner, who had left for Australia in July of that year. Emigration from England was at a peak, with over 350,000 people leaving that year. Brown, who at the time considered himself \"very hard up and a little mad\", was himself thinking of moving to India with his new family.\r Although Ford Madox Brown was never a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, The Last of England, like many of his paintings, exhibits all the characteristics of the movement. The painting depicts a man and his wife seeing England for the last time. The two main figures, based on Brown and his wife, Emma, stare ahead, stony-faced, ignoring the white cliffs of Dover which can be seen disappearing behind them in the top right of the picture. The family's clothing indicates that they are middle class, and so they are not leaving for the reasons that would force the emigration of the working classes; Brown's writing touched on the same theme:\r The fair-haired child in the background behind the man's shoulder is Brown and Emma's child, Catherine, who was born in 1850. The baby concealed under the woman's cloak, and whose hand she is clasping, is supposedly their second child, Oliver.\r In order to mirror the harsh conditions in the painting Brown worked mostly outside in his garden, and was happy when the weather was poor \u2014 he recorded his feelings of delight when the cold turned his hand blue, as this was how he wanted it to appear in the painting. He was seen as strange by his neighbours who saw him out in all kinds of weather. He composed a short verse to accompany the painting in which the woman is depicted as hopeful for the future:\r Brown's painting room was above a china shop at 33 High Street, Hampstead and sittings took place in the house's garden. His diary noted that the 'ribbons of the bonnet took me 4 weeks to paint'.\r Two finished versions of the picture exist, one in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and the other in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. A reduced watercolour replica of the painting in Birmingham produced between 1864\u201366 is in Tate Britain. A fully worked study also exists, and a detailed compositional drawing. All are in the form of round panels, a rarely revived Renaissance format called a tondo, but differ in colouring.\r In March 1859 The Last Sight of England as it was then known, was sold by Benjamin Windus to Ernest Gambart for 325 guineas (2010: \u00a326,700).\r The picture was voted Britain's eighth-favourite picture in a poll carried out by BBC Radio 4. In 2013 it was voted 32 out of 57 paintings chosen by the British public from national collections, which were used for Art Everywhere The World's Largest Public Art Exhibition.\n", "\nArtist: Ford Madox Brown\nArtwork Name: Work\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/ford-madox-brown/work-1863\n\nWikipedia Article:\nWork (1852\u201365) is a painting by Ford Madox Brown that is generally considered to be his most important achievement. It exists in two versions. The painting attempts to portray, both literally and analytically, the totality of the Victorian social system and the transition from a rural to an urban economy. Brown began the painting in 1852 and completed it in 1865, when he set up a special exhibition to show it along with several of his other works. He wrote a detailed catalogue explaining the significance of the picture.\r The painting was commissioned by Thomas Plint, a well-known collector of Pre-Raphaelite art, who died before its completion. A second version, smaller at 684 \u00d7 990\u00a0mm, was commissioned in 1859 and completed in 1863. This is now in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. It is closely similar, though for the lady with a blue parasol the face of Maria Leathart, the commissioner's wife, replaces that of Mrs Brown in the Manchester version.\r The picture depicts a group of so-called \"navvies\" digging up the road to build an underground tunnel. It is typically assumed that this was part of the extensions of London's sewerage system, which were being undertaken to deal with the threat of typhus and cholera. The workers are in the centre of the painting. On either side of them are individuals who are either unemployed or represent the leisured classes. Behind the workers are two wealthy figures on horseback, whose progress along the road has been halted by the excavations.\r The painting also portrays an election campaign, evidenced by posters and people carrying sandwich boards with the name of the candidate \"Bobus\". A poster also draws attention to the potential presence of a burglar.\r The setting is an accurate depiction of The Mount on Heath Street in Hampstead, London, where a side road rises up above the main road and runs alongside it. Brown made a detailed study of the location in 1852.\r Brown explained that he had intended to demonstrate that the modern British workman could be as fit a subject for art as the more supposedly picturesque Italian lazarone (literally, the \"mob,\" used to refer to the street people of Naples). He set the painting on Heath Street in Hampstead, of which he made a detailed study. Hampstead was at the time a wealthy area on the outskirts of London, which was undergoing rapid expansion. The development of the new sewerage and drainage systems in the city was also widely discussed in the press as an agent of modernisation. The character of \"Bobus\" appears in the writings of Thomas Carlyle as the epitome of a corrupt businessman who uses his money to market himself as a politician.\r Brown's principal artistic model was the work of William Hogarth, in particular his paintings Humours of an Election and his prints Beer Street and Gin Lane. The Election paintings depicted both the vitality and the corruption of British society, while the prints set up a contrast between poverty and prosperity. While working on the painting Brown founded the Hogarth club to link artists who saw themselves as Hogarth's admirers and followers.\n", "\nArtist: Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema\nArtwork Name: The Roses of Heliogabalus\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/sir-lawrence-alma-tadema/the-roses-of-heliogabalus-1888\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Roses of Heliogabalus is an 1888 painting by the Anglo-Dutch artist Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema depicting the young Roman emperor Elagabalus hosting a banquet.\r The painting measures 132.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0214.4 centimetres (52.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a084.4\u00a0in). It shows a group of Roman diners at a banquet, being swamped by drifts of pink rose petals falling from a false ceiling above. The Roman emperor Elagabalus reclines on a platform behind them, wearing a golden robe and a tiara, watching the spectacle with other garlanded guests. A woman plays the double pipes beside a marble pillar in the background, wearing the leopard skin of a maenad, with a bronze statue of Dionysus, based on the Ludovisi Dionysus, in front of a view of distant hills.\r The painting depicts a (probably invented) episode in the life of the Roman emperor Elagabalus, also known as Heliogabalus (204\u2013222), taken from the Augustan History. Although the Latin refers to \"violets and other flowers\", Alma-Tadema depicts Elagabalus smothering his unsuspecting guests with rose petals released from a false ceiling. The original reference is this:\r In his notes to the Augustan History, Thayer notes that \"Nero did this also (Suetonius, Nero, xxxi), and a similar ceiling in the house of Trimalchio is described in Petronius, Sat., lx.\" (Satyricon).\r The painting was commissioned by Sir John Aird, 1st Baronet for \u00a34,000 in 1888. As roses were out of season in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Alma-Tadema is reputed to have had rose petals sent from the south of France each week during the four months in which it was painted.\r The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1888. Aird died in 1911, and the painting was inherited by his son Sir John Richard Aird, 2nd Baronet. After Alma-Tadema died in 1912, the painting was exhibited at a memorial exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1913, the last time it was seen at a public exhibition in the UK until 2014.\r Alma-Tadema's reputation declined markedly in the decades after his death. Following the death of the 2nd Baronet in 1934, the painting was sold by his son, the 3rd Baronet, in 1935 for 483 guineas. It failed to sell at Christie's in 1960, and was \"bought in\" by the auction house for 100 guineas. Next it was acquired by Allen Funt: he was the producer of Candid Camera, and a collector of Alma-Tadema's at a time when the artist remained very unfashionable. After Funt experienced financial troubles, he sold the painting along with the rest of his collection at Sotheby's in London in November 1973, achieving a price of \u00a328,000. The painting was sold again by American collector Frederick Koch at Christie's in London in June 1993 for \u00a31,500,000.

It is in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. A preliminary oil sketch of the painting is at the Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum in Otterlo, and he also made lithographs of the image, which are held in collections including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The painting is considered to be one of Van Gogh's masterpieces.\r During March and the beginning of April 1885 he sketched studies for the painting, and corresponded with his brother Theo, who was not impressed with his current work or the sketches Van Gogh sent him in Paris. He worked on the painting from April 13 until the beginning of May, when it was mostly done except for minor changes which he made with a small brush later the same year.\r Van Gogh said he wanted to depict peasants as they really were. He deliberately chose coarse and ugly models, thinking that they would be natural and unspoiled in his finished work: \"You see, I really have wanted to make it so that people get the idea that these folk, who are eating their potatoes by the light of their little lamp, have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish, and so it speaks of manual labor and \u2014 that they have thus honestly earned their food. I wanted it to give the idea of a wholly different way of life from ours \u2014 civilized people. So I certainly don\u2019t want everyone just to admire it or approve of it without knowing why.\"\r Writing to his sister Willemina two years later in Paris, Van Gogh still considered The Potato Eaters his most successful painting: \"What I think about my own work is that the painting of the peasants eating potatoes that I did in Nuenen is after all the best thing I did\". However, the work was criticized by his friend Anthon van Rappard soon after it was painted. This was a blow to Van Gogh's confidence as an emerging artist, and he wrote back to his friend, \"you...had no right to condemn my work in the way you did\" (July 1885), and later, \"I am always doing what I can't do yet in order to learn how to do it.\" (August 1885).\r Van Gogh made a lithograph of the composition The Potato Eaters before embarking on the painting proper. He sent impressions to his brother, and in a letter to a friend, wrote that he made the lithograph from memory in the space of a day.\r Van Gogh had first experimented with lithography in The Hague in 1882. Though he appreciated small scale graphic work and was an enthusiastic collector of English engravings he worked relatively little in graphic mediums. In a letter dated around 3 December 1882 he remarks\r Van Gogh is often associated in people's minds with the Post-Impressionist movement, but in fact his artistic roots lay much closer to home in the artists of the Hague School such as Anton Mauve and Jozef Isra\u00ebls.\n", "\nArtist: Vincent van Gogh\nArtwork Name: The Starry Night\nArtwork Genre: cloudscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh/the-starry-night-1889\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Starry Night is an oil on canvas by the Dutch post-impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an idealized village.\r The Starry Night is regarded as among Van Gogh's finest works, and is one of the most recognized paintings in the history of Western culture. It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest.\r In the aftermath of the 23 December 1888 breakdown that resulted in the self-mutilation of his left ear, Van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole lunatic asylum on 8 May 1889. Housed in a former monastery, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole catered to the wealthy and was less than half full when Van Gogh arrived, allowing him to occupy not only a second-story bedroom but also a ground-floor room for use as a painting studio.\r During the year Van Gogh stayed at the asylum, the prolific output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued. During this period, he produced some of the best-known works of his career, including the Irises from May 1889, now in the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the blue self-portrait from September, 1889, in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. The Starry Night was painted mid-June by around 18 June, the date he wrote to his brother Theo to say he had a new study of a starry sky.\r Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's ground-floor studio, it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory. The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east, a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times, including The Starry Night. \"Through the iron-barred window,\" he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889, \"I can see an enclosed square of wheat . . . above which, in the morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory.\"\r Van Gogh depicted the view at different times of day and under various weather conditions, including sunrise, moonrise, sunshine-filled days, overcast days, windy days, and one day with rain. While the hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, he was able there to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper; eventually he would base newer variations on previous versions. The pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the Alpilles mountains. In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field. Van Gogh telescoped the view in six of these paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the picture plane.\r One of the first paintings of the view was F611 Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-R\u00e9my, now in Copenhagen. Van Gogh made a number of sketches for the painting, of which F1547 The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm is typical. It is unclear whether the painting was made in his studio or outside. In his June 9 letter describing it, he mentions he had been working outside for a few days. Van Gogh described the second of the two landscapes he mentions he was working on, in a letter to his sister Wil on 16 June 1889. This is F719 Green Field, now in Prague, and the first painting at the asylum he definitely painted outside en plein air. F1548 Wheat field, Saint-R\u00e9my de Provence, now in New York, is a study for it. Two days later, Vincent wrote Theo that he had painted \"a starry sky\".\n", "\nArtist: Vincent van Gogh\nArtwork Name: Van Gogh's Chair\nArtwork Genre: still life\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh/van-gogh-s-chair-1889\n\nWikipedia Article:\nVan Gogh's Chair is a painting created in 1888 by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh.

He had befriended the proprietors, Joseph and Marie Ginoux. The Yellow House, at 2 place Lamartine, had to be furnished before he could fully move in, but he was able to use it as a studio.

It depicts Dr. Paul Gachet who took care of Van Gogh during the final months of his life. There are two authenticated versions of the portrait, both painted in June 1890 at Auvers-sur-Oise. Both show Gachet sitting at a table and leaning his head on his right arm, but they are easily differentiated in color and style. In May 1990, the first version was sold at auction for $82.5 million ($154.5 million today), a new mark for the highest ever price for a painting, not surpassed for the first time until June 2006.\r In 1890, Van Gogh's brother Theo was searching for a home for the artist upon his release from an asylum at Saint-R\u00e9my. Upon the recommendation of Camille Pissarro, a former patient of the doctor who told Theo of Gachet's interests in working with artists, Theo sent Vincent to Gachet's second home in Auvers.\r Vincent van Gogh's first impression of Gachet was unfavorable. Writing to Theo he remarked: \"I think that we must not count on Dr. Gachet at all. First of all, he is sicker than I am, I think, or shall we say just as much, so that's that. Now when one blind man leads another blind man, don't they both fall into the ditch?\" However, in a letter dated two days later to their sister Wilhelmina, he relayed, \"I have found a true friend in Dr. Gachet, something like another brother, so much do we resemble each other physically and also mentally.\"\r Van Gogh's thoughts returned several times to the painting by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix of Torquato Tasso in the madhouse. After a visit with Paul Gauguin to Montpellier to see Alfred Bruyas's collection in the Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, asking if he could find a copy of the lithograph after the painting. Three and a half months earlier, he had been thinking of the painting as an example of the sort of portraits he wanted to paint: \"But it would be more in harmony with what Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix attempted and brought off in his Tasso in Prison, and many other pictures, representing a real man. Ah! portraiture, portraiture with the thought, the soul of the model in it, that is what I think must come.\"\r Van Gogh wrote to his sister in 1890 about the painting:\r Van Gogh painted Gachet resting his right elbow on a red table, head in hand.

It depicts Dr. Paul Gachet who took care of Van Gogh during the final months of his life. There are two authenticated versions of the portrait, both painted in June 1890 at Auvers-sur-Oise. Both show Gachet sitting at a table and leaning his head on his right arm, but they are easily differentiated in color and style. In May 1990, the first version was sold at auction for $82.5 million ($154.5 million today), a new mark for the highest ever price for a painting, not surpassed for the first time until June 2006.\r In 1890, Van Gogh's brother Theo was searching for a home for the artist upon his release from an asylum at Saint-R\u00e9my. Upon the recommendation of Camille Pissarro, a former patient of the doctor who told Theo of Gachet's interests in working with artists, Theo sent Vincent to Gachet's second home in Auvers.\r Vincent van Gogh's first impression of Gachet was unfavorable. Writing to Theo he remarked: \"I think that we must not count on Dr. Gachet at all. First of all, he is sicker than I am, I think, or shall we say just as much, so that's that. Now when one blind man leads another blind man, don't they both fall into the ditch?\" However, in a letter dated two days later to their sister Wilhelmina, he relayed, \"I have found a true friend in Dr. Gachet, something like another brother, so much do we resemble each other physically and also mentally.\"\r Van Gogh's thoughts returned several times to the painting by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix of Torquato Tasso in the madhouse. After a visit with Paul Gauguin to Montpellier to see Alfred Bruyas's collection in the Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, asking if he could find a copy of the lithograph after the painting. Three and a half months earlier, he had been thinking of the painting as an example of the sort of portraits he wanted to paint: \"But it would be more in harmony with what Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix attempted and brought off in his Tasso in Prison, and many other pictures, representing a real man. Ah! portraiture, portraiture with the thought, the soul of the model in it, that is what I think must come.\"\r Van Gogh wrote to his sister in 1890 about the painting:\r Van Gogh painted Gachet resting his right elbow on a red table, head in hand. Two yellow books as well as the purple medicinal herb foxglove are displayed on the table. The foxglove in the painting is a plant from which digitalis is extracted for the treatment of certain heart complaints, perhaps an attribute of Gachet as a physician.\r The doctor's \"sensitive face\", which Van Gogh wrote to Paul Gauguin carried \"the heartbroken expression of our time\", is described by Robert Wallace as the portrait's focus.

It is displayed at the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg.\r According to the Hermitage Museum, the painting \"expresses the great psychological tension under which Van Gogh found himself\"; two of the windows, considered the \"eyes\" of a home, are rendered with \"alarming\" red splashes, while the star, a sign of fate, is seen as symbolic of van Gogh's anguish.\r It is thought that van Gogh painted White House at Night around 8:00 PM due to the position of the \"star\" in the painting. Astronomers Donald Olson and Russell Doescher from the Texas State University-San Marcos calculated that the star in the painting must be Venus which was bright in the evening sky in June 1890. The house is the same one depicted in Blossoming Chestnut Tree.\r The painting has a turbulent history. It was exhibited in Switzerland several times during the 1920s, but in the late 1920s disappeared into the private collection of German industrialist Otto Krebs, Many of his acquisitions were of a style which was soon to be labelled \"degenerate art\" by the Nazis, which contributed towards the already publicity-shy Krebs keeping his collection secret.\r Thought to have been lost after World War II, the painting languished in the Hermitage archives for fifty years before resurfacing in 1995 as part of an exhibition displaying artworks looted by the Soviets at the end of the war. Three other van Gogh's from Kreb's collection were also shown: Landscape with House and Ploughman, Morning: Going out to Work (After Millet), and the Portrait of Madame Trabuc.\n", "\nArtist: Caspar David Friedrich\nArtwork Name: Dolmen in snow\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caspar-david-friedrich/dolmen-in-snow-1807\n\nWikipedia Article:\nCairn in Snow, also known as Dolmen in the snow, (German: H\u00fcnengrab im Schnee, literally \"Giant's grave in the snow\") is a landscape painting by the German painter Caspar David Friedrich. Friedrich is noted for his landscapes depicting features such as trees or Gothic ruins, silhouetted against the sky or in morning mists. The painting depicts leafless trees in the winter snow, with the tops of two of the trees broken off and the third bent by the prevailing wind, giving the work a haunted, spectral air. It is a Romantic allegorical landscape, depicting a stone cairn or dolmen set amid three oak trees on a hilltop, with a contemplative melancholy mood. It was probably painted around 1807, making it among Friedrich's first oil paintings. It measures 61 by 80 centimetres (24\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a031\u00a0in) and has been held by the Galerie Neue Meister in Dresden since 1905.\r The main elements of the painting are taken from different locations in eastern Germany. The cairn is thought to be based on the Neolithic burial site at Gro\u00dfsteingrab G\u00fctzkow\u00a0(de), near the town G\u00fctzkow in West Pomerania; the megalith was destroyed before 1818, but Friedrich had sketched it since at least 1802. Friedrich sketched the trees at Neubrandenburg, most clearly an 1807 sepia sketch H\u00fcnengrab am Meer (\"Dolmen by the sea\"). Similar oak trees reappear in several works by Friedrich, including Monk in the Snow (1808, also known as Winter), The Abbey in the Oakwood (1818), Monastery graveyard under snow (1818) and Oak tree in snow (1829). The hill is located near Wustrow. The painting also includes four ravens, two above the cairn, one to the right, and a fourth high in the tree to the right.\r The painting alludes to Christian and pagan symbolism. Trees and forests were seen as symbols of life endurance, longevity, and immortality. Sacred groves, often a group of trees in ancient times, were associated with secrecy and initiation rites, and they were regarded as untouchable. The main trees depicted in this painting by Friedrich appear to have had most of their old branches chopped off. The three trees around the cairn recalls the three wooden crosses on Golgotha at the crucifixion of Jesus, and the stone chamber where Christ's body was entombed. The painting also alluides to the permanence of the ancient stone landmark, the strength of the oak tree to withstand the storm broken and bowed but not defeated, and the continuity of life in the middle of winter.\r Art critics have interpreted the painting as a meditation on life and death, and on the political situation in Germany following the defeats of Prussia by Napoleon's French army at the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt in 1806. Around the same times, Friedrich was working on his 1807 Tetschen Altar.\r The painting was first owned by the Greifswald University professor Karl Schildener\u00a0(de). It painting is described in 1828 in the Greifswald academical journal (II, 2, pp.\u00a040\u201341). The work was sold at auction in Leipzig in 1845 and acquired by Friedrich's friend and fellow painter Johan Christian Dahl. Dahl imitated the work in his own painting, Megalithic Tomb in Winter. It was sold from the estate of Dahl's only surviving son, Johann Siegwald Dahl\u00a0(de), and acquired by the Galerie Neue Meister in Dresden in 1905.\n", "\nArtist: Caspar David Friedrich\nArtwork Name: The Abbey in the Oakwood\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caspar-david-friedrich/the-abbey-in-the-oakwood\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Abbey in the Oakwood (German: Abtei im Eichwald) is an oil painting by Caspar David Friedrich. It was painted between 1809 and 1810 in Dresden and was first shown together with the painting The Monk by the Sea in the Prussian Academy of Arts exhibition of 1810. On Friedrich's request The Abbey in the Oakwood was hung beneath The Monk by the Sea. This painting is one of over two dozen of Friedrich's works that include cemeteries or graves. \r After the exhibition both pictures were bought by king Frederick Wilhelm III for his collection. Today the paintings hang side by side in the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin.\r A procession of monks, some of whom bear a coffin, head toward the gate of a ruined Gothic church in the center of the painting. Only two candles light their way. A newly dug grave yawns out of the snow in the foreground, near which several crosses can be faintly discerned. This lower third of the picture lies in darkness\u2014only the highest part of the ruins and the tips of the leafless oaks are lit by the setting sun. The waxing crescent moon appears in the sky.\r The picture appeared at a time when Friedrich had his first public success and critical acknowledgment with the controversial Tetschener Altar. Although Friedrich's paintings are landscapes, he designed and painted them in his studio, using freely drawn plein air sketches, from which he chose the most evocative elements to integrate into an expressive composition. The Abbey in the Oakwood is based upon studies of the ruins of Eldena Abbey, which reappear in several other paintings. The same trees, in slightly altered forms, can also be seen in other works.\r Eldena Abbey may well have had personal meaning for Friedrich, as it was destroyed during the Thirty Years War by invading Swedish troops, who later used bricks from the abbey to construct fortifications. In the painting Friedrich draws a parallel between those actions and the use of Greifswald churches as barracks by occupying French soldiers. Thus, the funeral becomes a symbol of \"the burial of Germany's hopes for resurrection\".\r Friedrich may have begun work on The Abbey in the Oakwood in June 1809 after a stay in R\u00fcgen, Neubrandenburg. On 24 September 1810, shortly before the Berlin Academy exhibition, Carl Frederick Frommann described the setting sun and half-moon of the nearly-finished painting.\n", "\nArtist: Caspar David Friedrich\nArtwork Name: The Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caspar-david-friedrich/the-wanderer-above-the-sea-of-fog\n\nWikipedia Article:\nWanderer above the Sea of Fog (German: Der Wanderer \u00fcber dem Nebelmeer), also known as Wanderer above the Mist or Mountaineer in a Misty Landscape, is an oil painting c.\u20091818 by the German Romantic artist Caspar David Friedrich. It has been considered one of the masterpieces of Romanticism and one of its most representative works. It currently resides in the Kunsthalle Hamburg in Hamburg, Germany.\r In the foreground, a young man stands upon a rocky precipice with his back to the viewer. He is wrapped in a dark green overcoat, and grips a walking stick in his right hand. His hair caught in a wind, the wanderer gazes out on a landscape covered in a thick sea of fog. In the middle ground, several other ridges, perhaps not unlike the ones the wanderer himself stands upon, jut out from the mass. Through the wreaths of fog, forests of trees can be perceived atop these escarpments. In the far distance, faded mountains rise in the left, gently leveling off into lowland plains in the east. Beyond here, the pervading fog stretches out indefinitely, eventually commingling with the horizon and becoming indistinguishable from the cloud-filled sky.\r The painting is composed of various elements from the Elbe Sandstone Mountains in Saxony and Bohemia, sketched in the field but in accordance with his usual practice, rearranged by Friedrich himself in the studio for the painting. In the background to the right is the Zirkelstein. The mountain in the background to the left could be either the Rosenberg or the Kaltenberg. The group of rocks in front of it represent the Gamrig near Rathen. The rocks on which the traveler stands are a group on the Kaiserkrone.\r Wanderer above the Sea of Fog is true to the Romantic style and Friedrich's style in particular, being similar to other works such as Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen and The Sea of Ice. Gorra's (2004) analysis was that the message conveyed by the painting is one of Kantian self-reflection, expressed through the wanderer's gazings into the murkiness of the sea of fog. Dembo (2001) sympathised, asserting that Wanderer presents a metaphor for the unknown future. Gaddis (2004) felt that the impression the wanderer's position atop the precipice and before the twisted outlook leaves \"is contradictory, suggesting at once mastery over a landscape and the insignificance of the individual within it\".\r Some meaning of this work is lost in the translation of its title. In German, the title is \"Wanderer \u00fcber dem Nebelmeer\". Wanderer in German can mean either \"wanderer\" or \"hiker\".\r Robert Macfarlane discusses the painting in terms of its significant influence on how mountain climbing has been viewed in the Western world since the Romantic era, calling it the \"archetypical image of the mountain-climbing visionary\", and describing its power in representing the concept that standing on mountain tops is something to be admired, an idea which barely existed in earlier centuries.\n", "\nArtist: Caspar David Friedrich\nArtwork Name: Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caspar-david-friedrich/chalk-cliffs-on-r-gen\n\nWikipedia Article:\nChalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (German: Kreidefelsen auf R\u00fcgen) is an oil painting of circa 1818 by German Romantic artist Caspar David Friedrich.\r In January 1818, Caspar David Friedrich married Christiane Caroline Bommer, who was about 20 years his junior. On their honeymoon in July and August 1818, they visited relatives in Neubrandenburg and Greifswald. From there, the couple undertook an excursion to the island of R\u00fcgen with Friedrich's brother Christian. The painting appears as a celebration of the couple's union.\r The painting depicts the view from the chalk cliffs of the Stubbenkammer, at that time one of the most famous lookout points on the island. It is frequently but incorrectly believed that the Wissower Klinken outcrops in particular were a model for the painting; however, these did not exist at the time of the painting's creation, but appeared later because of erosion. Friedrich often composed his landscapes from carefully chosen elements of different sketches, so that a specific location is not necessarily discernible.\r Two trees, whose leaves cover the upper third of the painting, frame the scenery. Two men and a woman in town clothes gaze in wonder at the view. The thin figure in the middle is usually interpreted as Caspar David Friedrich himself. His hat lies beside him as a sign of humility. He seeks for a foothold in the grass as a symbol of the transience of life and looks into the abyss opening before him\u2014the abyss of death. On the right, the man with crossed arms leans against the trunk of a dying tree and looks far out to the sea. The two tiny sailboats stand as symbols for the soul which opens to eternal life and correspond to the figures of the two men. On the left, the woman in a red dress (who is usually identified as Friedrich's wife Caroline) sits beside an almost dried-up shrub: only the twigs around her face are leafing out. With her right hand she points either at the abyss or at the flowers bordering it. In contrast to the men, who gaze either at the abyss or into the distance, she communicates with the other figures\u2014whether she feels threatened by the abyss or compelled by the natural beauty is unclear.\r The colors of the figure's clothes are also symbolic. The middle figure is blue, the color of faith; the left figure is red, that of love; and the right figure is green, that of hope. Thus they can be interpreted as embodiments of the three Christian theological virtues: faith, hope and love. The art historian Helmut B\u00f6rsch-Supan sees in the picture a representation of Friedrich's relation to death, and the threat to life by death: \"clear [...] as almost never before, but at the same time also in an unusually serene mood\".\n", "\nArtist: Caspar David Friedrich\nArtwork Name: The Tree of Crows\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caspar-david-friedrich/not-detected-7\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Tree of Crows (also known as Raven Tree) is an oil painting of 1822 by the German Romantic artist Caspar David Friedrich. Acquired by the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in 1975, it has been called one of Friedrich's \"most compelling paintings.\"\r The painting depicts a twisted oak tree, bare but for a few dead leaves, seen against an evening sky. An inscription on the back of the canvas refers to the hill at the painting's center as a H\u00fcnengrab, or dolmen, a prehistoric burial ground. In the distance can be seen the ocean, and Cape Arkona's chalk cliffs, a favorite subject of Friedrich's. Two crows are perched on the oak, while a flock descends toward it. In the darkened foreground are a hacked trunk and the upright stump of another oak.\r The oak is based on a drawing dated 3 May 1809, to which Friedrich added branches at the left and elongated others so as to stretch its forms across the picture plane; the tree in the painting has the overall shape of a rhombus, its web of contorted branches taking on a dramatic presence. Contrasted with the serene layers of chromatic clouds, the tree's forms have been likened to \"many flailing arms.\" The foreground may be seen as representing death, with the distant sky offering consoling beauty and the promise of redemption after life.\r A single dominant oak was also the subject of two later vertical compositions painted by Friedrich.

It measures 55\u00a0\u00d7\u00a071 centimetres (22\u00a0\u00d7\u00a028\u00a0in). The work depicts a panoramic view of a romantic landscape of plains with mountains in the background. A solitary oak tree dominates the foreground.\r An ancient oak stands at the centre of the painting, clearly damaged but still standing. The tree's branches, dark in silhouette, project into the largely overcast morning sky. Banks of cloud seem to form a dome above the tree. The crown of the tree is dead, and the top of its trunk and two truncated branches resemble a cross. A shepherd shelters under the leaf-bearing lower branches. His flock of sheep graze beside a pond in the wide grassy meadow around the tree. In the middle distance, villages and a town nestle among other trees and bushes. Tree-clad hills pile up into blue-grey mountains in the background.\r The work was commissioned by banker and art collector Joachim Heinrich Wilhelm Wagener, together with a second painting Moonrise by the Sea (Mondaufgang am Meer) to create a pair of \"times of the day\", depicting morning and evening landscape scenes, in a tradition of Claude Lorrain. It was completed before November 1822 and has been held by the Berlin National Gallery since 1861, donated by Wagener as part of its founding collection. It is now in the Alte Nationalgalerie of the Staatliche Museen in Berlin.\r Art historian Helmut B\u00f6rsch-Supan has suggested that the mountains are in the Riesengebirge, now in the Czech Republic, which historically divided Silesia and Bohemia, southeast of Dresden, where Friedrich settled in 1798. Friedrich painted the mountains several times between 1806 and 1810. The double peak may be Jeschken.\r The painting has drawn a number of interpretations.

The Disaster-stricken North Pole Expedition.\r The collector Johann Gottlob von Quandt commissioned two pictures that were to symbolize the south and the north. Johann Martin von Rohden received the commission to paint Southern Nature in her Abundant and Majestic Splendor, while the commission for Northern Nature in the whole of her Terrifying Beauty fell to Friedrich. However, as Schukowski in a letter dated 1821 reported, Friedrich -\r Accounts of expeditions to the North Pole were occasionally published during those years which is likely how Friedrich became familiar with William Edward Parry's 1819\u20131820 expedition to find the Northwest Passage. In the winter of 1820\u201321, Friedrich made extensive oil studies of ice floes on the river Elbe, near Dresden. These were probably incorporated into The Sea of Ice.\r The image created a lasting impression on the French sculptor David d'Angers during his visit to Dresden in 1834, which he described as follows:\r Overall, however, the work was seen as too radical in composition, and went unsold until after Friedrich's death in 1840.\r From the twentieth century the work has proved extremely influential upon the arctic landscapes of Lawren Harris, and directly influenced Paul Nash's painting Totes Meer. The painting has been hailed by critic Russell Potter as a key instance of the \"Arctic Sublime,\" and an influence on later nineteenth-century polar paintings by Frederic Edwin Church and William Bradford.\r Architect Thom Mayne references The Sea of Ice as a primary influence as to how he approaches the dynamic relationship between architecture, landscape, and nature.\r The painting appears on the cover of the album The Mekons: Honky Tonkin' (1987) by UK band the Mekons.

Completed just five years before his death, this picture, like many of his works, forms a meditation both on his own mortality and on the transience of life.\r The painting is set on a sea shore and shows in the foreground an aged man with his back turned to the viewer, walking towards two adults and two children on a hilltop overlooking a harbour. The figures are echoed by five ships shown in the harbour, each at a different distance from the shore, an allegorical reference to the different stages of human life, to the end of a journey, to the closeness of death.\r The figures have been identified as Friedrich and his family. The aged man is the artist himself, the small boy is his young son Gustav Adolf, the young girl is his daughter Agnes Adelheid, the older girl is his daughter Emma, and the man in the top hat is his nephew Johann Heinrich.\r Although many of Friedrich's paintings were set in imagined landscapes, The Stages of Life is recognisably located at Utkiek, near Friedrich's birthplace of Greifswald in today's northeastern Germany.\r The painting depicts a Baltic Sea port in the dusk. On the sea three sailing ships returning home can be seen; the large ship in the middle has already begun to draw in its sails. Two smaller sailboats have almost reached land. The one on the right heads directly for the group of five people on the bank, who by their clothes are recognizable as townspeople. In their midst sits a boy who holds up a Swedish pennant, while the girl beside him reaches for it. To their right sits a woman who leans toward both children with her right hand raised.\r These five figures correspond to the five ships visible in the harbour beyond. The three groupings of figures (one aged man, two adults, and two children) echo the positioning of the ships at various distances from the shore as allegorical of the stages of life, and closeness to death. The central ship is thought to represent the mother, while further inshore, two small boats\u2014references to the two children\u2014have only just begun their voyage and still remain in shallow, clear water. To the horizon, the farthest ship disappears into the setting horizon, symbolizing the aged man's voyage from this life into the unknown.\r Alternatively, other critics have interpreted the two ships in the distance as the mother and father sailing off to live their lives and gain experience and wisdom as parents, and the large ship closest to the shore as the old man - one who has lived a full life, built up many experiences and is finally pulling into the harbor at the end of life.\r The group forms a semicircle: the children are on its farthest point; to their left and right are a younger man and the young woman. On the extreme left an older man stands looking straight ahead, outside the circle. The women and children are dressed for summer, while the old man wears a coat and a fur hat. The bow of the big ship in the middle is exactly aligned with the two children.\n", "\nArtist: Jacques-Louis David\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Francois Buron\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david/portrait-of-francois-buron-1769\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Fran\u00e7ois Buron is a 1769 painting by Jacques-Louis David.

It depicts the Byzantine general Belisarius, who heroically defeated the Vandals in North Africa in AD 533\u2013534 on behalf of Justinian I, and (according to an apocryphal account probably added to his biography in the Middle Ages) was later blinded by the emperor and reduced to begging for alms on the street. David exhibited the work at the Salon of 1781 after returning from Italy and it proved a great success.\r It is now on show at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lille.\r The theme of mercy is omnipresent in the work, focusing on the three people considered most \"base\": the woman, the child and the old man who embodies the image of Mercy. The hands of these three individuals horizontally convey the idea of weakness involving need and love. The soldier, meanwhile, in the background, lifts his hands vertically to show his astonishment, with his chest forward. The three human ages represented give an idea of the glory of youth and the wreck of old age.\r The same subject had already been used by Peyron in his own Belisarius receiving Hospitality from a Peasant; in contrast, only a few characters are present here and the scene is dependent on the story for dramatic effect. David shows us a fallen hero, old and blind, begging in the street with a young child when one of his former soldiers, astonished, recognises him.\r The setting is Antique: sober, austere and overwhelming architecture is placed behind the depiction of harsh conditions. This shows that the artist wanted to associate Greek style with heroic themes in the context of the concerns of the artist's time. Essentially, it is through the theme of virtues borrowed from ancient times that the \"true style,\" later called neo-classical, spread into art, rejecting the frivolities of the royal court of Louis XVI at the time of the French revolution. In the very composition of the work of David, however, the essence of the tableau juxtaposes several rococo ideas, and is thus not a completely neo-classical work. Nonetheless, the neo-classical perspective can still be found, especially in the ideas behind this painting: a revolutionary (David) offers a meditation on the moral heroism in adversity.\n", "\nArtist: Jacques-Louis David\nArtwork Name: Equestrian Portrait of Stanislas Kostka Potocki\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david/equestrian-portrait-of-stanislas-kostka-potocki-1781\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Count Stanislas Potocki is a 1781 equestrian portrait of the Polish patron, politician, writer and Prime Minister of Poland Stanis\u0142aw Kostka Potocki by the French painter Jacques-Louis David.

The painting immediately became a huge success with critics and the public, and remains one of the best known paintings in the Neoclassical style.\r It depicts a scene from a Roman legend about a dispute between two warring cities, Rome and Alba Longa, and stresses the importance of patriotism and masculine self-sacrifice for one's country. Instead of the two cities sending their armies to war, they agree to choose three men from each city; the victor in that fight will be the victorious city. From Rome, three brothers from a Roman family, the Horatii, agree to end the war by fighting three brothers from a family of Alba Longa, the Curiatii. The three brothers, all of whom appear willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of Rome, are shown saluting their father who holds their swords out for them. Of the three Horatii brothers, only one shall survive the confrontation. However, it is the surviving brother who is able to kill the other three fighters from Alba Longa: he allows the three fighters to chase him, causing them to separate from each other, and then, in turn, kills each Curiatii brother. Aside from the three brothers depicted, David also represents, in the bottom right corner, a woman crying whilst sitting down. She is Camilla, a sister of the Horatii brothers, who is also betrothed to one of the Curiatii fighters, and thus she weeps in the realisation that, in any case, she will lose someone she loves.\r The principal sources for the story behind David's Oath are the first book of Livy (sections 24\u201326) which was elaborated by Dionysius in book 3 of his Roman Antiquities. However, the moment depicted in David's painting is his own invention. The painting led to the popularization of the Roman salute.\r It grew to be considered a paragon of neoclassical art. The painting increased David's fame, allowing him to take on his own students.\r In 1774, David won the Prix de Rome with his work \u00c9rasistrate d\u00e9couvrant la cause de la maladie d\u2019Antiochius. This allowed him to stay five years (1775\u20131780) in Rome as a student from the French government. Upon his return to Paris he exhibited his work, which Diderot greatly admired; the success was so resounding that King Louis XVI of France allowed him to stay in the Louvre, a very ancient privilege desired by artists. There he met Pecoul, contractor for the actual buildings, and Pecoul's daughter, whom he married. The king's assistant, Charles-Claude Flahaut de la Billaderie, commissioned Oath of the Horatii with the intention that it be an allegory about loyalty to the state and therefore to the king. Nevertheless, David departed from the agreed-upon scene, painting this scene instead. The painting was not completed in Paris, but rather in Rome, where David was visited by his pupil Jean-Germaine Drouais who had himself recently won the Prix de Rome. Ultimately, David's picture manifests a progressive outlook, deeply influenced by Enlightenment ideas, that eventually contributed to the overthrow of the monarchy. As the French Revolution approached, paintings increasingly referred to the loyalty to the state rather than the family or the church. Painted five years before the Revolution, the Oath of the Horatii reflects the political tensions of the period.\n", "\nArtist: Jacques-Louis David\nArtwork Name: The Death of Socrates\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david/the-death-of-socrates-1787\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Death of Socrates (French: La Mort de Socrate) is an oil on canvas painted by French painter Jacques-Louis David in 1787. The painting focuses on a classical subject like many of his works from that decade, in this case the story of the execution of Socrates as told by Plato in his Phaedo. In this story, Socrates has been convicted of corrupting the youth of Athens and introducing strange gods, and has been sentenced to die by drinking poison hemlock. Socrates uses his death as a final lesson for his pupils rather than fleeing when the opportunity arises, and faces it calmly. The Phaedo depicts the death of Socrates and is also Plato's fourth and last dialogue to detail the philosopher's final days, which is also detailed in Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito.\r In the painting, an old man in a white robe sits upright on a bed, one hand extended over a cup, the other gesturing in the air. He is surrounded by other men of varying ages, most showing emotional distress, unlike the stoic old man. The young man handing him the cup looks the other way, with his face in his free hand. Another young man clutches the thigh of the old man. An elderly man sits at the end of the bed, slumped over and looking in his lap. To the left, other men are seen through an arch set in the background wall.\r Although he consulted Father Adry, a scholar on the subject, David's depiction of Socrates death contains many historical inaccuracies. For simplicity, he removed many characters originally described in the dialogues of Plato. However, he included Apollodorus, the man leaning against the wall just within the arch, even though he is said to have been sent away by Socrates for displaying too much grief. David also misrepresented the ages of many of the pupils of Socrates, including Plato. Plato would have been a young man at the time of Socrates's death, but in this painting he is the old man sitting at the foot of the bed. Even the face of Socrates is much more idealized than the classical bust that is typically used as a reference portrait of Socrates.\r David uses color to highlight the emotion in this painting. The shades of red are more muted on the edges of the painting and become more vibrant in the center, culminating in the dark red robe of the man holding the cup of poison, generally taken as offering the cup to Socrates rather than receiving it after Socrates had consumed its contents. The only two serene men, Socrates and Plato, are garbed in a contrasting bluish-white. The more muted color scheme of this painting may be a response to critics of David's Oath of the Horatii, who called his colors \"garish\".\r David signed this painting in two places; he put his full signature under Crito, the young man clutching Socrates's thigh, and his initials under Plato. David's signature placement often had symbolic meaning \u2013 for example, in his painting of Stanis\u0142aw Kostka Potocki, David signed in the collar of the dog that is barking at the sitter. In Death of Socrates, his signatures also have meaning. His initials under Plato are a reference to the fact that the story comes from Plato, a thanks for the inspiration. His fuller signature under Crito means that this is the character whom the artist identifies most with. This may be a reference for Crito\u2019s position in the composition \u2013 clutching Socrates's thigh. In this way, David would be seen as a man who likewise clutches at the morals and values that Socrates represents.\n", "\nArtist: Jacques-Louis David\nArtwork Name: Paris and Helen\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david/paris-and-helen-1788\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Loves of Paris and Helen is a 1788 painting by Jacques-Louis David, showing Helen of Troy and Paris from Homer's Iliad.

It is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.  David was paid 7,000 livres for the portrait on 16 December 1788. It was not permitted a public display at the Paris Salon for fear that an image of Lavoisier \u2013 a figure connected to the royal court and the Ancien R\u00e9gime \u2013 might provoke anti-aristocratic aggression from viewers.  In 1836, the painting was left by Marie-Anne to her great-niece, and it remained in the collection of the comtesse de Chazelles and her descendants until 1924, when it was bought by John Davison Rockefeller. Rockefeller gave it to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in 1927, and it was acquired from this institution by the Metropolitan Museum in 1977.  The work is painted in oils on a canvas of 259.7\u00a0\u00d7 194.6 cm.  It shows the couple in Lavoisier's office, with a wood-panelled floor and walls of false marble with three classical pilasters. In the centre the couple face the viewer, with both their heads in three-quarters profile. Marie-Anne is shown standing, looking at the viewer. Her costume is that in fashion at the end of the 18th century \u2013 a white wig, a white dress with a lace collar, and a blue fabric belt. She rests on her husband's shoulder, with her right hand leaning on the table.  Antoine Lavoisier is seated, wearing a black vest, culottes, stockings and buckled shoes, a white shirt with a lace jabot and a powdered wig. His face turns towards his wife and he rests his left arm on the table, whilst writing with his right hand using a quill pen. The table is covered with scarlet velvet, many papers, a casket, an inkwell with two more quill pens, a barometer, a gasometer, a water still and a glass bell jar. A large round-bottom flask and a tap are on the floor to the right, by the table. To the table's extreme left is a chair with a large document-case and black cloth on it.

Lavoisier and objects of science visibly displayed on the right, and Madame with her document case of artistic drawings prominently displayed on the left side of the portrait. Significant also is the depiction by David of the wife in a posture physically above the husband, somewhat atypically by late 18th century conventional standards of depicting a married couple in portraiture.  The painting is signed at the lower left: L DAVID, PARISIIS ANNO, 1788.

On a canvas of more than twelve square feet, this painting was first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1789. The subject is the Roman leader Lucius Junius Brutus, founder of the Roman Republic, contemplating the fate of his sons. They had conspired to overthrow the republic and restore the monarchy, and Brutus himself was compelled to order their deaths. In doing so, Brutus became the heroic defender of the republic, at the cost of his own family. The painting was a bold allegory of civic virtue with immense resonance for the growing cause of republicanism. Its themes of virtue, sacrifice, and devotion to the nation sparked much controversy when it was unveiled in the politically charged era of the French Revolution.\r David labored over the painting for more than two years before he considered it complete. His attachment to the motif of Brutus had been evident for years before this painting, at least since the early 1780s when he was making The Oath of the Horatii (1784). This earlier work bears a distinct connection to Brutus through the themes of duty, loyalty, and virtue. The oath itself was an element of the Brutus legend which David artistically transposed to the Horatii. Similar license was taken with the composition of Brutus: the return of the sons' bodies is an episode not found in the accounts of Livy and Plutarch.\r David's enthusiasm for the republican cause, at least at this early stage, is a matter of dispute. Many historians believe his painterly inspirations were more prosaic, drawn from standard classical history lessons and lesser events of contemporary notoriety. In spite of its quick apotheosis by the public, some contemporaries questioned the personal intentions of David regarding this work, and the debate remains unresolved.\r Like most of David's works, Brutus is on a large canvas. It measures 323 centimetres (127\u00a0in) in height and 422 centimetres (166\u00a0in) in width. The style of painting is in the Neoclassical manner. Brutus sits on a klismos on the left, alone and brooding; to the right, his wife holds their two horrified daughters, while a servant on the far right quakes in anguish.\r Note Brutus' tense crossed feet in the picture, the sharp scissors that lay dead in the center of the painting, and the use of light and dark to draw a distinction between Brutus and his wife. Brutus does not even look back as his headless sons are brought into the room.\r The name is frequently rendered in English as Brutus Receiving the Bodies of His Sons, among other variations, including Brutus and His Dead Sons and simply Brutus. The complete original name as presented to the Salon was much lengthier and more explicative. It too has been rendered in various forms, but as translated from the small Salon guidebook (livret) offered in 1789, it reads, with poignancy in the first year of the Revolution, as: Brutus, first consul, returned to his house after having condemned his two sons who had allied themselves with the Tarquins and conspired against Roman liberty; the lictors return their bodies so that they may be entombed.\n", "\nArtist: Jacques-Louis David\nArtwork Name: The Oath in the Tennis Court\nArtwork Genre: history painting,sketch and study\nArtwork Media: canvas,ink,oil,pen,pencil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david/the-oath-in-the-tennis-court-1791\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Tennis Court Oath (French: Le Serment du Jeu de paume) is an incomplete painting by Jacques-Louis David, painted between 1790 and 1794 and showing the titular Tennis Court Oath at Versailles, one of the foundational events of the French Revolution.   Political reversals and financial difficulties meant that David was never able to finish the canvas, which measures 400 by 660\u00a0cm and is now in the Mus\u00e9e national du Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles.  All the deputies are shown looking at Bailly, as a device to show their support of him. The only man to refuse to take the oath, Martin-Dauch, is shown in the lower right hand corner and provides a counterpoint to the general enthusiasm. David also drew all the faces in detail so that every figure was recognisable. Above are large windows with smiling figures of the public.  In the 18th century, an oath had a sacred value and guaranteed a person would be faithful to their word, as in David's own The Oath of the Horatii. During the French Revolution, collective oaths like the tennis court oath were considered as a factor in national unity and national unanimity. The tennis court oath \u2013 pre-Romantic, near-unanimous, almost totally middle-class and with no popular violence \u2013 above all was considered the forerunner of the 1789 revolution and also showed that national sovereignty was made up of each individual's personal will.  David's painting also portrays the monk Dom Gerle alongside the Protestant pastor Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-\u00c9tienne, symbolising a new era of religious tolerance. The wind blowing through the windows and billowing the curtains also symbolises the wind of Revolution blowing through France.  The first engravings showing The Tennis Court Oath only appeared in 1790, the year David convinced the Jacobin Club to launch a national subscription to fund a painting to depict the event. He exhibited a pen and brown ink drawing of his planned painting in the Louvre in 1791 but did not have enough money to follow it through as the subscription had only had a 10% take-up. The National Constituent Assembly thus decided to fund the work from the public treasury instead, topped up by selling engravings of the painting.  David set up a studio in the former Les Feuillants Convent to hold sittings for the deputies, then meeting in the nearby salle du Man\u00e8ge. However, by 1793, he was too busy as a deputy himself to complete his sketch for the painting and French political life was no longer conducive to the work \u2013 Mirabeau, one of the heroes of 1789, had been declared an enemy of the Revolution on the discovery of his secret correspondence with Louis XVI and was now considered as a traitor by public opinion. A large number of deputies to the National Constituent Assembly had been identified as enemies of the Government of Public Safety. David therefore left the work unfinished and the subscribers reclaimed their engraving from him.  David's 1810 The Distribution of the Eagle Standards and his 1814 Leonidas at Thermopylae were directly inspired by The Tennis Court Oath. The work was also reprised and adapted by several artists from the late 18th century onwards. These included Auguste Couder in 1848 and Luc-Olivier Merson in 1883.\n", "\nArtist: Jacques-Louis David\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Madame Charles-Louis Trudaine\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david/portrait-of-madame-charles-louis-trudaine-1792\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Madame Marie-Louise Trudaine is an unfinished 1791\u20131792 portrait of Marie-Louise Trudaine by the French painter Jacques-Louis David.

France was at war with other European nations after a period of civil conflict culminating in the Reign of Terror and the Thermidorian Reaction, during which David had been imprisoned as a supporter of Robespierre. David hesitated between representing either this subject or that of Homer reciting his verses to his fellow Greeks. He finally chose to make a canvas representing the Sabine women interposing themselves to separate the Romans and Sabines, as a 'sequel' to Poussin's The Rape of the Sabine Women.\r Work on the painting commenced in 1796, after his estranged wife visited him in jail. He conceived the idea of telling the story, to honour his wife, with the theme being love prevailing over conflict. The painting was also seen as a plea for the people to reunite after the bloodshed of the revolution. Its realization took him nearly four years.\r The painting depicts Romulus's wife Hersilia \u2013 the daughter of Titus Tatius, leader of the Sabines \u2013 rushing between her husband and her father and placing her babies between them. A vigorous Romulus prepares to strike a half-retreating Tatius with his spear, but hesitates.\r The rocky outcrop in the background is the Tarpeian Rock, a reference to civil conflict, since the Roman punishment for treason was to be thrown from the rock. According to legend, when Tatius attacked Rome, he almost succeeded in capturing the city because of the treason of the Vestal Virgin Tarpeia, daughter of Spurius Tarpeius, governor of the citadel on the Capitoline Hill. She opened the city gates for the Sabines in return for 'what they bore on their arms.' She believed that she would receive their golden bracelets. Instead, the Sabines crushed her to death with their shields, and she was thrown from the rock which since bore her name.\r The genesis of Les Sabines and the work itself represented a significant departure for the day. Historical depictions had been typically commissioned. David however, conceived, produced and promoted his work for profit. He produced marketing material to accompany the first exhibition. Le Tableau des Sabines, Expos\u00e9 Publiquement au Palais National des Sciences et des Arts \"the Tableau of the Sabines, Public Exhibition at the National Palace of Arts and Science\" contained his own account of the episode and anticipated the controversy over his use of nudity with an end-note explaining his rationale. Its 1799 exhibition attracted a large number of paying visitors for several years and in 1819 he sold Les Sabines and his L\u00e9onidas at Thermopylae to the Royal Museums for 10,000 francs.\r Starting in 1977, France issued a series of definitive stamps featuring the head of Hersilia based on David's painting.\r After the expulsion of artists including David from the Louvre, the picture could be found in the ancient church of Cluny, which he used as a workshop.\n", "\nArtist: Jacques-Louis David\nArtwork Name: Madame Recamier\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david/madame-recamier-1800\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Madame R\u00e9camier is an 1800 portrait of the Parisian socialite Juliette R\u00e9camier by Jacques-Louis David showing her in the height of Neoclassical fashion, reclining on an Directoire style sofa in a simple Empire line dress with almost bare arms, and short hair \"\u00e0 la Titus\".

Pope Pius appears in David's The Coronation of Napoleon, depicted as blessing the emperor, when in fact he was merely a spectator, assisting at the ceremony with a resigned expression throughout.\r The painting seems to have been commissioned by Count Charles Fleurieu, Quartermaster General for the French emperor, though no written mention of a commission survives. It was painted at the Tuileries around the end of February 1805 from life. David seems to have been won over and impressed by Pius's simplicity and deep humanity, choosing to show him in an introspective pose rather than as the most powerful prelate in Christianity. He was paid 10,000 francs for his work and the portrait was exhibited in the Gallery of the French Senate at its seat in the Ch\u00e2teau du Luxembourg and then assigned to the Mus\u00e9e Napol\u00e9on (now known as the Louvre). It was displayed again at the Ch\u00e2teau in 1824 before being returned to its permanent home in the Louvre in 1827.\r David produced three copies of the portrait, assisted by one of his students (probably Georges Rouget), two of which were commissioned by Napoleon for the Mus\u00e9e de Fontainebleau and for the Mus\u00e9e du Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles.

The painting has imposing dimensions, as it is almost 10 metres (33\u00a0ft) wide by a little over 6 metres (20\u00a0ft) tall.\r The work was commissioned by Napoleon orally in September 1804 and its official title is Consecration of the Emperor Napoleon I and Coronation of the Empress Josephine in the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris on 2 December 1804. Jacques-Louis David started work on 21 December 1805 in the former chapel of the College of Cluny, near the Sorbonne, which served as a workshop. Assisted by his student Georges Rouget, he put the finishing touches in January 1808. From 7 February to 21 March 1808, the work was exhibited at the Salon annual painting display in 1808, and it was presented to the Salon decennial prize competition in 1810. The painting remained the property of David until 1819, when it was transferred to the Royal Museums, where it was stored in the reserves until 1837. Then, it was installed in the Chamber Sacre of the museum of the historical Palace of Versailles on the orders of King Louis-Philippe. In 1889, the painting was transferred to the Louvre from Versailles.\r David was commissioned by American entrepreneurs to paint a full size replica, in 1808, immediately after the release of the original. He began work that year, painting it from memory, but didn't finish until 1822, during his exile in Brussels. The replica was eventually returned to France in 1947, to the original's place in the Palace of Versailles.\r The painting is a subject of The Public Viewing David's 'Coronation' at the Louvre', a painting by Louis-L\u00e9opold Boilly done in 1810, currently housed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\r The composition is organised around several axes, and incorporates the rules of neoclassicism.

It shows French Emperor Napoleon I in uniform in his study at the Tuileries Palace. Despite the detail, it is unlikely that Napoleon posed for the portrait.\r It was a private commission from the Scottish nobleman and admirer of Napoleon, Alexander Hamilton, 10th Duke of Hamilton in 1811 and completed in 1812. Originally shown at Hamilton Palace, it was sold to Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery in 1882, from whom it was bought by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation in 1954, which deposited it in Washington D.C.'s National Gallery of Art, where it now hangs.\r Vertical in format, it shows Napoleon standing, three-quarters life size, wearing the uniform of a colonel of the Imperial Guard Foot Grenadiers (blue with white facings and red cuffs). He also wears his L\u00e9gion d'honneur and Order of the Iron Crown decorations, along with gold epaulettes, white French-style culottes and white stockings. His face is turned towards the viewer and his right hand is in his jacket.\r Piled on the desk are a pen, several books, dossiers and rolled papers. More rolled papers and a map are on the green carpet to the left of the desk - on these papers is the painter's signature LVDci DAVID OPVS 1812. All this, along with Napoleon's unbuttoned cuffs, wrinkled stockings, disheveled hair, the flickering candles and the time on the clock (4.13am) are all meant to imply he has been up all night, writing laws such as the Code Napol\u00e9on - the word \"Code\" is prominent on the rolled papers on the desk. This maintains his new civil rather than heroic (as in Canova's Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker) or military (as in David's own Napoleon Crossing the Alps) image, though the sword on the chair's armrest still refers back to his military successes. The fleurs-de-lys and heraldic bees also imply the stability of the imperial dynasty.\r A second version painted by David, showing exactly the same scene but with Napoleon in his more everyday green mounted chasseurs uniform, was formerly in Prince Napoleon's collection and has since 1979 been in that of the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles.\r An analysis of the original painting reveals that the artist reedited the composition and details several times to balance the image, add allusions, and capture a complete story.\r Brush strokes and texture indicate that an earlier version had Napoleon's upper body flanked by two fluted columns about the width of the figure's torso. These strong vertical elements would have created a distraction from the central figure.\r These columns were revised to a carved panel in shadow (on the viewer's left) and a clock with a large face (viewer's right) on level with and somewhat larger than the figure's face. The clock was later repainted with a smaller face moved up and to the right, with the clock body still covering the underlying column brush strokes.\r These revisions greatly improved the compositional balance of the painting's upper section, reducing the impression of three vertical columns. They successfully moved the viewer's focus to Napoleon's face and expression and away from the presumably accurate stature and middle-heavy build.\n", "\nArtist: Jacques-Louis David\nArtwork Name: Leonidas at Thermopylae\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david/leonidas-at-thermopylae-1814\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLeonidas at Thermopylae is an oil on canvas painting by French artist Jacques-Louis David. The work currently hangs in the Louvre in Paris, France. The massive painting has the dimensions of about thirteen feet by seventeen and a half feet and was completed in 1814. The convoluted piece took David almost fifteen years to complete, with him separating his work into two periods from 1799 to 1803 and 1813-1814. Leonidas at Thermopylae was purchased, along with The Intervention of the Sabine Women, in November of 1819 for 100,000 francs by Louis XVIII, the king of France at the time. The piece shows the Spartan king Leonidas prior to the Battle of Thermopylae. David's pupil Georges Rouget collaborated on it.\r The crowded and theatrical scene that David depicts takes place in a time of war, seemingly in Greece from the Greek temple and temperate mountains in the background. The war we see is the Battle of Thermopylae, which took place in 480 B.C. Thermopylae, which is a Greek word that means \u201chot gates,\u201d was chosen to be the perfect place for this battle because of its mountainous geography and narrow passageway. This helped the Greeks hold a better stand against the Persians who were invading the area. King Leonidas, the Spartan leader, \u201cdelayed the invasion of Darius I and the Persians\u2026by sacrificing himself and his men to give the Greeks the time they needed to organize an ultimately victorious resistance\u201d in the long run. While this act of bravery and sacrifice by King Leonidas and his three hundred soldiers proved to be a defeat at the time, it inspired David during France\u2019s own internal war.\r When David painted Leonidas at Thermopylae, France was experiencing the fall of the First French Empire under Napoleon Bonaparte. David felt that France needed a hero to sacrifice himself for the greater good of his country, and the story of Leonidas and the Battle of Thermopylae inspired him. This was all taking place during the French Revolution where enemy soldiers were closing in on the French borders; these events are similar to how the Spartans felt during the Battle at Thermopylae, the core theme of David\u2019s painting.\r When Napoleon Bonaparte saw the exhibit of David\u2019s latest paintings in 1799, \u201che criticized the lack of action and the fixed poses of the warriors in The Sabine Women.\u201d This critique by one of David\u2019s heroes compelled David to return to what he thought of as the Academy\u2019s primary principles, Greek classical art. This masterpiece is one in which fully features not only the principles, but also the Greek subjects to convey the heroic nature of this historical battle.\r David made many sketches before the final oil on canvas composition was executed. A sketch dating back to 1814 is a compositional study that was completed in two separate parts, leaving the final result somewhat choppy and overworked. There are a few differences between this compositional study and the final painting, one of which being a more full view of the background which resulted from the removal of trees and branches from the earlier sketch. Classical male figures were included from the beginning of David's sketches for Leonidas at Thermopylae.\n", "\nArtist: Jacques-Louis David\nArtwork Name: Cupid and Psyche\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david/cupid-and-psyche-1817\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLove and Psyche or Cupid and Psyche is an 1817 painting by Jacques-Louis David, now in the Cleveland Museum of Art.

Ingres\u2014who had made his debut at the Salon the previous year\u2014thus became one of five artists (the others were Jean-Baptiste Greuze, Robert Lef\u00e8vre, Charles Meynier, and Marie-Guillemine Benoist) who were commissioned to paint full-length portraits of Napoleon to be distributed to the prefectural towns of Li\u00e8ge, Antwerp, Dunkerque, Brussels, and Ghent, all of which were newly ceded to France in the 1801 Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville.\r Ingres was 23 when he received the commission for the painting from the city of Li\u00e8ge. He was unable to get Bonaparte to sit for it and had to base the pose on a portrait of him from 1802 by Antoine-Jean Gros. Ingres' painting shows its subject aged 34 with his right hand about to sign an act titled \"Faubourg d\u2019Amerc\u0153ur reb\u00e2ti\" (Amerc\u0153ur suburb rebuilt). This decree refers to one signed by Napoleon in 1803 to the prefecture of the Ourthe d\u00e9partement to restore this suburb and is an attempt to demonstrate to the newly annexed city the benefits of being part of France and to symbolically take possession of the city.\r Bonaparte is shown not as a long-haired revolutionary or in the blue uniform he wears in Gros' Bonaparte au pont d'Arcole, but in the red uniform of a consul of the republic, with short hair. Instead of resting his hand on his sword in a martial pose, he assumes a civilian one, placing it inside his jacket. The curtain is open in the background showing St. Lambert's Cathedral, Li\u00e8ge as complete, when in fact it was being demolished at this time during the Li\u00e8ge Revolution. The excesses of the French Revolution and of the counter-revolutionaries were put into perspective by the painting, in a context of d\u00e9tente and reconciliation between the French Republic and the Catholic Church. Official relations between France and the papacy had been poor since civil constitution of the clergy in 1790, but the painting's reconstruction of the then-ruined cathedral symbolised the resumption of good relations between them and the \"protection\" the First French Republic granted to the Catholic Church in the concordat of 1801.\n", "\nArtist: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Mademoiselle Rivi\u00e8re\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres/portrait-of-mademoiselle-riviere-1805\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe portrait of Mademoiselle Caroline Rivi\u00e8re was painted in 1806 by the French Neoclassical artist Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, and today hangs in the Louvre.\r It is the third of three portraits of the Rivi\u00e8re family the artist painted that year. Caroline's father, Philibert Rivi\u00e8re, was a successful court official under Napoleon's empire, and sought to commemorate himself, his wife and daughter through a commission with the then young and rising artist\u2014his portraits of Philibert and his wife are also still extant. Although Ingres favoured subject matter drawn from history or Greek legend, at this early stage in his career he earned his living mainly through commissions from wealthy patrons.\r The family lived outside Paris, at St. Germain-en-Laye, and Mademoiselle Caroline Rivi\u00e8re would have been between 13 and 15 at the time she was portrayed; Ingres described her as the \"ravishing daughter\".\r The Rivi\u00e8re's portrait describes slightly built and youthful femininity and hints at a hesitant openness. The painting is rendered in bright hues and set against a serene white-blue early spring landscape, the freshness of which was intended to reflect the youth of the sitter. The background is not deeply portrayed; the perspective is shallow and rises\u2014according to the art historian Robert Rosenblum\u2014in \"flattened horizontal tiers against which the figure seems crisply silhouetted as if in low relief.\"\r Typical of contemporary portraits by Ingres, Caroline lacks anatomical accuracy. Her neck is overly elongated, and the bridge of her nose extends too far. Rivi\u00e8re is portrayed with a stiffness and awkwardness typical of her age, and shown in a manner which was intended to emphasise a sense of the nascent purity and simplicity of her youth. Yet the painting is generally seen in the light of pathos and tragedy, as the sitter died within a year of the work being completed.\r It was, along with Ingres's two other portrayals of the family, exhibited in the 1806 Salon, but was poorly received for its perceived \"Gothicness\" (due to its precision of line and enamel finish) and its similarity to Jan van Eyck and other artists of Early Netherlandish painting (in French \"Les Primitifs Flamands\") who at the time were only just being rediscovered. Further, the manner in which the whiteness of the sitter's dress contrasts with the curve of her boa offended some viewers. Today the painting is typically seen as a peak in Ingres's artistic career, and in this work Ingres introduces an emotional link between figurative and landscape art, and the watery scape behind the sitter evokes rhythms with many of the visual themes presented in the rich imagery of the foreground.\r In 2003, the art critic Jonathan Jones remarked of the painting,\r Mademoiselle Caroline Rivi\u00e8re was bequeathed to the Louvre in 1870 by Caroline Rivi\u00e8re's sister-in-law.\n", "\nArtist: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Monsieur Rivi\u00e8re\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres/portrait-of-monsieur-rivi%C3%A8re-1805\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Philibert Rivi\u00e8re is a c. 1805 oil on canvas painting by the French Neoclassical artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres.

Madame Rivi\u00e8re, born Marie-Fran\u00e7oise-Jacquette-Bibiane Blot de Beauregard, and known as Sabine, married Philibert Rivi\u00e8re de L'Isle, an influential court official in the in Napoleonic Empire, who commissioned this work, along with portraits of himself and their daughter, Caroline.  The painting is composed from white, chilly blue, beige and ochre colours. It has an overall, deliberately flat and shadow-less appearance. The portrait has been described as having \"an ambiance of female voluptuousness, [and] pampered femininity\". Seated on a blue cushon or sofa, Sabine, then in her mid-30s, wears a low-cut and wide necked prom dress, with a high waist and short sleeves, a cream colored chiffon, and a cashmere shawl. He black hair is arranged in curls. The painting shocked critics when exhibited at the 1808 Salon, particularly they were perplexed at the illogical and unnatural anatomy. A point of focus was her deliberately elongated right arm. The technique however was to become a hallmark on Ingres' female portraits, in this case the arm is lengthened to rhyme with the curve of the oval frame.  There has been speculation as to why their son Paul was not portrayed and the background to the commission is unclear. Philibert Rivi\u00e8re was likely impressed by the painter's 1804 Bonaparte, First Consul; his own portrait echoes the emperor's pose. Unusually for Ingres, no preparatory drawings are known. Ingres' never saw the three Rivi\u00e8re paintings after the 1808 Salon, he tried to find and reunite them for an 1855 exhibition, but all the sitters had died (Caroline in 1807, Philibert in 1816, and Sabine in 1848), and could not determine the location of the canvasses.

In his right hand he holds the sceptre of Charlemagne and in his left the hand of justice. On his head is a golden laurel wreath, similar to one worn by Caesar. He also wears an ermine hood under the great collar of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, a gold-embroidered satin tunic and an ermine-lined purple velvet cloak decorated with gold bees. The coronation sword is in its scabbard and held up by a silk scarf. The subject wears white shoes embroidered in gold and resting on a cushion. The carpet under the throne displays an imperial eagle. The signature INGRES P  is in the bottom left, and ANNO 1806 in the bottom right.\r The painting was exhibited as work number 272 at the 1806 Paris Salon as His Majesty the Emperor on his throne, when it was recorded as being owned by the Corps l\u00e9gislatif. At the same salon Robert Lef\u00e8vre exhibited his Portrait of Napoleon in his coronation costume. In 1815 Ingres's painting was transferred to the Louvre Museum, where it was first inventoried as MR 2069 and is now known as INV. 5420. In 1832 the comte de Forbin had it put on display in the Hotel des Invalides, at first in the chapel then from 1860 in the library. It is now on show in the Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e.\r At the top right of the painting (and much more visibly on the preparatory drawing), cut off halfway across its width, can be seen a shield with the arms of the Papal States, Este, Lombardy, Venice and Savoy, all surmounted with the crown of Italy. From this S\u00e9bastien Allard hypothesizes that the painting was commissioned by an Italian institution to show Napoleon as king of Italy not as emperor, but, due to its innovative iconography, the original commissioners refused it and that was why it was acquired by the Corps l\u00e9gislatif.\r This portrait's frontality refers to the colossal Statue of Zeus at Olympia by Phidias, whose pose served as the model not only for many representations of sovereigns but also for Christian iconography. Ingres himself also used this pose for his Jupiter and Thetis. The mus\u00e9e de Montauban has a chalice with an image after a Byzantine panel showing the seated emperor, which may have been Ingres' direct model.\r For Robert Rosenblum, Ingres's model was the figure of God the Father on the Ghent Altarpiece by Jan van Eyck, which was in the Louvre at the time Ingres painted this portrait. The contemporary critic Pierre-Jean-Baptiste Chaussard compared Ingres's style in this portrait to that of Van Eyck (then known as Jean de Bruges):\r However, Ingres himself stated:\r In the left border of the carpet, among medallions of the zodiac, is a medallion with a version of the Madonna della seggiola by Raphael, the artist Ingres most admired.

Originally a student work painted in 1808, it was enlarged and completed in 1827. The painting depicts Oedipus explaining the riddle of the Sphinx. An oil painting on canvas, it measures 189 x 144 cm, and is in the Louvre, which acquired it in 1878.\r The painting was begun in Rome, where Ingres had arrived belatedly in 1806 after winning the Grand Prix de Rome in 1801. Working in a studio on the grounds of the Villa Medici, Ingres continued his studies and, as required of every winner of the Prix, he sent works at regular intervals to Paris so his progress could be judged. As his envoi of 1808 Ingres sent a life-size Figure of Oedipus and The Valpin\u00e7on Bather, hoping by these two paintings to demonstrate his mastery of the male and female nude. The academicians were moderately critical of the treatment of light in both paintings, and considered the figures to be insufficiently idealized.\r Afterwards, Ingres retained the Figure of Oedipus in his studio for years. Around 1825 he decided to rework it to turn what was essentially a figure study into a more developed narrative scene. He enlarged the canvas, adding 20 cm to the left edge, 31 cm to the top, and 31 cm to the right. Within the expanded picture space he created a dramatic contrast between the brightly illuminated landscape seen in the distance, and the shadows that envelop the Sphinx. Ingres modified the pose of the Sphinx and added the human remains seen in the lower left corner. The fleeing man seen at the right, whose attitude and expression reveal Ingres' study of Poussin, was also added at this time. In November 1827 Ingres exhibited the finished work, along with two portraits, in the Salon, where they were well received.\r The painting is signed and dated 1808 at the lower left. Ingres sold Oedipus and the Sphinx in 1829, and it entered the Louvre in 1878.\r A small oil sketch of ca. 1826 in which Ingres tested his composition before reworking the painting is in the National Gallery, London. It was once owned by Edgar Degas, who purchased it in 1897 or earlier.\r In 1864 Ingres painted a third version of Oedipus and the Sphinx, smaller than the first version, which reverses the composition and varies many details.

Painted while the artist was studying at the French Academy in Rome, it was originally titled Seated Woman but later became known after one of its nineteenth-century owners.\r Although the painting was not met with favour by critics when first exhibited, almost fifty years later, when the artist's reputation was well established, the Goncourt brothers wrote that \"Rembrandt himself would have envied the amber color of this pale torso\", while the Louvre described it as \"a masterpiece of harmonious lines and delicate light\".\r Ingres had earlier painted female nudes, such as his Bathing Woman of 1807, yet this work is widely regarded as his first great treatment of the subject. As with the previous smaller work, the model is shown from behind, however The Valpin\u00e7on Bather lacks the earlier painting's overt sexuality, instead depicting a calm and measured sensuality.\r Charles Baudelaire (1821\u20131867) described the model as having a \"deep voluptuousness\", yet in many ways she is presented as essentially chaste. This contradiction is apparent in many elements of the painting. The turn of her neck and the curves of her back and legs are accentuated by the fall of the metallic green draperies, the swell of the white curtain in front of her and the folds of the bed sheets and linen. However, these elements are countered by the cool tone in which her flesh is rendered as well as by elements such as the elegant black-veined marble to the left of her.\r Remarking on Ingres' ability to paint the human body in a unique manner, the art critic Robert Rosenblum wrote that \"the ultimate effect of [The Valpin\u00e7on Bather] is of a magical suspension of time and movement\u2014even of the laws of gravity ... the figure seems to float weightlessly upon the enamel smoothness of the surface, exerting only the most delicate pressure, and the gravitational expectations of the heaviest earthbound forms are surprisingly controverted.\"\r Ingres returned to the form of this figure a number of times in his life; culminating in his The Turkish Bath of 1863, where the central figure in the foreground playing a mandolin echoes in rhythm and tone the model of the Valpin\u00e7on bather.\n", "\nArtist: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres\nArtwork Name: Charles-Marie-Jean-Baptiste Marcotte (Marcotte d'Argenteuil)\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres/charles-marie-jean-baptiste-marcotte-marcotte-d-argenteuil\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Charles Marcotte (also known as Marcotte d'Argenteuil) is an 1810 oil on canvas painting by the French Neoclassical artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, completed during the artists first stay in Rome. Charles Marie Jean Baptiste Marcotte (1773-1864) was a long term friend, loyal supporter and adviser to Ingres, and commissioned a number of portraits of his family and friends, as well as works such as Odalisque with Slave (1839). He was 23 years in age when the portrait was painted, and serving as inspector general for Waters and Forests in Napoleonic Rome.\r Although handsome, and possessing strong bone structure, he is portrayed as dour and serious, dressed in an imposing military uniform, and given a stern facial expression, with tightly pursed lips, which are turned down at the corners. A number of art historians have noted how his stiffness resemble Ingres' own early self-portraits, particularly that of 1804.\r Marcotte stands against a plain grey-green background, leaning against a table draped with a red cloth. His stiff, starched white and yellow neck collar appears tight and restrictive. He wears a blue carrick with a cape and velvet collar, over a white shirt and yellow waistcoat. Affectionately, his hair appears ruffled, which somewhat breaks the overall grim and morose tone. Special attention is given to his claw-like right hand, with its long sinuous fingers, the shape of which is echoed by the tassels protruding from the scroll beside him.\r Marcotte commissioned the portrait as a gift to his mother.

Painted when the artist was yet 31, the work severely and pointedly contrasts the grandeur and might of a cloud-born Olympian male deity against that of a diminutive and half nude nymph. Ingres' subject matter is borrowed from an episode in Homer's Iliad when the sea nymph Thetis begs Jupiter to intervene and guide the fate of her son Achilles; who was at the time embroiled in the Trojan War.\r The painting is steeped in the traditions of both classical and neoclassical art, most notably in its grand scale of 136\u215d\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0101\u00bc inches. Ingres creates many visual contrasts between the god and the slithering nymph: Jupiter is shown facing the viewer frontally with both his arms and legs spread broadly across the canvas, while the color of his dress and flesh echos that of the marble at his feet. In contrast, Thetis is rendered in sensuous curves and portrayed in supplication to the mercy of a cruel god who holds the fate of her son in his hands. Thetis' right hand falls on Jupiter's hip with a suggestion of erotic caress, while the dark green of her dress accents the dread and foreboding of the bare landscape behind. Her clothing is drawn up against her lower hip, and seems about to fall off. The focal point of the work is Thetis' left hand extended vertically upright as she attempts to stroke the beard of the god.\r Jupiter's pose is closely based on that of the famous chryselephantine sculpture, the Statue of Zeus at Olympia (Zeus being Jupiter's Greek equivalent), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. This was made by the Greek sculptor of the Classical period, Phidias, circa 432 BC and destroyed in Antiquity, but its pose is known from coins and small replicas. Here the pose is reversed right to left, and the arm to the viewer's right is higher than in the original, which held out a statue of Nike.\r Jupiter and Thetis was painted to meet the artist's obligations to the French Academy in Rome, and although its overhand tone correctly reflected the patriarchal bias of Napoleon's regime in its contrast between male power and female subservience, it is generally regarded as a rejection of such values. Ingres highly regarded the painting, and in a manner it marries the great motifs of his career: the voluptuousness of the female character and the authoritative austerity on the male deity.\r Ingres kept Jupiter and Thetis in his studio until 1834, when it was purchased by the state. In 1848, he made a single pencil copy. The painting was first exhibited at the 1811 Paris Salon, at a time when Ingres' attention to line coupled with his disregard for anatomical reality was yet to find favour among critics.\n", "\nArtist: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres\nArtwork Name: The Grande Odalisque\nArtwork Genre: nude painting (nu)\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres/the-grande-odalisque-1814\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGrande Odalisque, also known as Une Odalisque or La Grande Odalisque, is an oil painting of 1814 by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres depicting an odalisque, or concubine. Ingres' contemporaries considered the work to signify Ingres' break from Neoclassicism, indicating a shift toward exotic Romanticism.\r Grande Odalisque attracted wide criticism when it was first shown. It is renowned for the elongated proportions and lack of anatomical realism. The work is displayed in the Louvre, Paris.\r The painting was commissioned by Napoleon's sister, Queen Caroline Murat of Naples, and finished in 1814. Ingres drew upon works such as Dresden Venus by Giorgione, and Titian's Venus of Urbino as inspiration for his reclining nude figure, though the actual pose of a reclining figure looking back over her shoulder is directly drawn from the 1809 Portrait of Madame R\u00e9camier by Jacques-Louis David.\r Ingres portrays a concubine in languid pose as seen from behind with distorted proportions. The small head, elongated limbs, and cool color scheme all reveal influences from Mannerists such as Parmigianino, whose Madonna with the Long Neck was also famous for anatomical distortion.\r This eclectic mix of styles, combining classical form with Romantic themes, prompted harsh criticism when it was first shown in 1814. Critics viewed Ingres as a rebel against the contemporary style of form and content. When the painting was first shown in the Salon of 1819, one critic remarked that the work had \"neither bones nor muscle, neither blood, nor life, nor relief, indeed nothing that constitutes imitation\". This echoed the general view that Ingres had disregarded anatomical realism. Ingres instead favored long lines to convey curvature and sensuality, as well as abundant, even light to tone down the volume. Ingres continued to be criticized for his work until the mid-1820s.\r Stemming from the initial criticism the painting received, the figure in Grande Odalisque is thought to be drawn with \"two or three vertebrae too many.\" Critics at the time believed the elongations to be errors on the part of Ingres, but recent studies show the elongations to have been deliberate distortions. Measurements taken on the proportions of real women showed that Ingres's figure was drawn with a curvature of the spine and rotation of the pelvis impossible to replicate. It also showed the left arm of the odalisque is shorter than the right. The study concluded that the figure was longer by five instead of two or three vertebrae and that the excess affected the lengths of the pelvis and lower back instead of merely the lumbar region.\r Another interpretation of this painting suggests that since the duty of some concubines was merely to satisfy the carnal pleasures of the sultan, this elongation of her pelvic area may have been a symbolic distortion by Ingres. While this may represent sensuous feminine beauty, her gaze, on the other hand, has been said to \"[reflect] a complex psychological make-up\" or \"[betray] no feeling\". In addition, the distance between her gaze and her pelvic region may be a physical representation of the depth of thought and complex emotions of a woman's thoughts and feelings.\n", "\nArtist: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Madame de Senonnes\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres/portrait-of-madame-de-senonnes\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Madame de Senonnes (once known as La Trast\u00e9verine) is an 1814 painting by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It shows Madame de Senonnes, n\u00e9e Marie-Genevieve-Marguerite Marcoz, viscountess of Senonnes (29 June 1783, Lyon - 25 April 1828 (Paris)). Marcoz was 31 when the portrait was completed. Ingres had earlier portrayed her in a drawing of 1813.\r The portrait is considered one of Ingres' finest. Because she was significantly attractive and aristocratic, Ingres', who professed to disdain portraiture, but needed the money, but great effort into the work, in the hope of attracting other commissions. Portrait of Madame de Senonnes is part of the collection of Le tableau fait partie des collections at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Nantes.\r Born into a relatively wealthy family, she married Jean Marcoz, a merchant draper, in 1802, and they moved to Rome in 1803, and had a daughter, Genevi\u00e8ve-Am\u00e9lina Talensier that year. However, the marriage was unhappy, and they separated in 1809. Talensier left Rome to fight in the french army, and was wounded twice.\r She began to socialise in artistic circles, passing herself off as Italian. Marcoz met Alexandre de La Motte-Barac\u00e9, Viscount of Senonne, and they married in 1815, the year after their returne to France.\r After her death in 1828, the portrait remained in the possession of her husband until 1831, when, pursued by creditors, he sent it to his elder brother, the Marquis de Senonnes, where it was kept in his castle in Feneu, in the west of France. The painting remained there until 1852, until it was discovered by chance on a pavement outside an art dealers. It was acquired by the us\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Nantes for 4,000 francs.\r Marcoz is shown in a seductive and languid pose on a sofa, her hair tightly pulled back. She is dressed in a low cut luxurious velvet gown trimmed with ochre Indian muslin, a blond lace collar, and transparent lace, and with a white cashmere shawl. She is painted in bright red and gold colors, against a large, dark circular, mirror, lit by candle light, that reflects the back of her head and, especially, the curve of her neck. Her hands, which contain thirteen pale red and green jewel studded ring, caresses a white pillow and handkerchief. As with all of Ingres' female portraits, the sitter seems limbless, as if her body was not supported by a bone structure.\r The work is Ingres' first to fully explore the use of a mirror, and the additional spatial space it allows, earlier seen but not as successfully, in the 1805 Mademoiselle Caroline Rivi\u00e8re.\r His signature is written in the business tucked into the edge of the mirror. A number of small paper studies survive; the earliest of which show her reclining erotically on a sofa, the later sketches focus on the presentation of her upper body and chest.

An oil painting on canvas measuring 147 x 199 cm, it is owned by the Louvre. Ingres subsequently painted several variants of the composition.\r Orlando Furioso, a 16th-century epic poem by Ariosto, is the source of the tale of Roger, a knight whose steed is a hippogriff (a legendary creature half horse and half eagle). While riding near Brittany's coast Roger espies a beautiful woman, Angelica, chained to a rock on the Isle of Tears. She has been abducted and stripped naked by barbarians who have left her there as a human sacrifice to a sea monster. As Roger rides to her aid, a great thrashing in the water occurs\u2014it is the monster approaching Angelica. Roger drives his lance between the monster's eyes and rescues Angelica.\r Ingres received the commission for the work in 1817 and completed it in 1819. When it was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1819 alongside his Grande Odalisque, the work was criticised for the treatment of Angelica's figure, described by the art historian Th\u00e9ophile Silvestre as \"Angelica with goitres\" and by the painter Henry de Waroquier as \"triple-breasted Angelica\". Comte de Blacas, the French ambassador to the Vatican, acquired the painting for King Louis XVIII. It was installed above a doorway in the throne room of Versailles from 1820 until 1823 before being relocated to the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg. It was Ingres' first painting to enter a public collection.\r Ingres executed the work with his usual care, and many preparatory drawings for the composition and the individual figures exist.\r He painted several later versions of the composition, none of which are known to have been commissioned. A reduced copy of the painting in a vertical format was painted sometime before 1839, and eventually acquired by Edgar Degas, who purchased it in 1894. It was later acquired by the National Gallery, London. An 1841 replica, in an oval format, is in the Mus\u00e9e Ingres. A painting of 1859, also in an oval format, repeats the figure of Angelica but nearly eliminates Roger, whose presence is indicated only by his shield visible at the right edge.

It shows a vow to the Virgin Mary by Louis XIII of France. It is an oil painting on canvas measuring 421 x 262 cm.\r It was commissioned by France's Ministry of Interior in August 1820 for the cathedral of Notre-Dame in Montauban. The subject of the painting was to be Louis XIII's vow in 1638 to consecrate his kingdom to the Virgin in Her Assumption. When Ingres accepted the commission, he was living in Florence. Although he had experienced success as a portrait painter, his ambition was to establish a reputation in the more prestigious genre of history painting. He went to work with his usual diligence, and spent four years bringing the large canvas to completion.\r He travelled to Paris with it in October 1824. It was a critical success at that year's Salon and was later seen as representing Ingres as the main representative of classicism, in opposition to the romanticism represented at the same Salon by The Massacres of Scio by Delacroix. Conceived in a Raphaelesque style relatively free of the archaisms for which he had been reproached in the past, it marked Ingres' grand return to the Paris art world after his years in Rome and Florence, and his abandonment of a more daring style. Ingres found himself celebrated throughout France.

The symmetrical composition depicts Homer being crowned by a winged figure personifying Victory or the Universe. Forty-four additional figures pay homage to the poet in a kind of classical confession of faith.\r A state commission to decorate a ceiling of the mus\u00e9e Charles X at the Louvre (now the ancient Egyptian galleries), it formed part of a renovation project commissioned by Charles X to have himself remembered in the grand tradition of Bourbon building works at the Louvre. A condition of the commission was that it was to be completed within a year's time. Upon receiving the commission, Ingres conceived the idea for his painting quickly\u2014it was a source of pride to him that he had required only an hour to establish the broad outlines of his composition. The subsequent care he took in developing his idea is evident in more than 100 drawings and numerous painted sketches for it that survive, in which he can be seen making the composition and the details more and more precise. Ingres's level of research can be seen in the painting's portrait of Nicolas Poussin, which is directly copied from Poussin's 1650 self-portrait now in the Louvre.\r The composition is a symmetrical grouping centred in a classical way in front of an ancient Greek temple. The painting's catalogue entry at the time of its first exhibition describes it as \"Homer receiving homage from all the great men of Greece, Rome and modern times. The Universe crowns him, Herodotus burns incense. The Iliad and Odyssey sit at his feet.\"\r The final painting's colours are very fresh and clear, giving the impression of fresco. Ingres wished to compete with Raphael through this painting (it is strongly inspired by the Italian artist's Parnassus) and Raphael is to be seen top left (in black and white Renaissance dress), being led by Apelles (in a blue cloak). Other figures shown include Dante who is shown being led by Virgil as in the former's Divine Comedy (extreme left, behind Poussin) and Moli\u00e8re (right, by the feet of the personification of the Odyssey).\r The art historian Robert Rosenblum said The Apotheosis of Homer represents \"Ingres' most doctrinaire statement of his belief in a hierarchy of timeless values that are based on classical precedent.\" It is highly successful in its genre, though leaves an impression of coldness, an impression which was reinforced at the time of its production by the exhibition of Delacroix's The Death of Sardanapalus at the same year's Paris Salon. Ingres had been considered revolutionary early in his career, but this contrast now faced off a Romantic renewal under Delacroix against the purest classical tradition as shown by Ingres. The Apotheosis of Homer was taken down from its initial site in 1855 and replaced later that year with a copy by Paul and Raymond Balze (in collaboration with Michel Dumas).\r Surrounding Homer are poets, artists, and philosophers both ancient and modern\u2014the modern personages are mostly confined to the lower register of the composition, although Ingres deemed Raphael and Michelangelo worthy of elevation to stand alongside the ancients.\n", "\nArtist: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres\nArtwork Name: Don Pedro of Toledo Kissing the Sword of Henri IV\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres/don-pedro-of-toledo-kissing-the-sword-of-henri-iv\n\nWikipedia Article:\nDon Pedro of Toledo Kissing Henry IV's Sword is an 1814 painting in the Troubador style by the French artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, showing the Spanish ambassador Pedro \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 5th Marquis of Villafranca kissing the sword of Henry IV of France (held by a young page) in the salle des Caryatides of the Louvre palace.\r The artist painted four versions of the subject between 1814 and 1832:\n", "\nArtist: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres\nArtwork Name: The Martyrdom of St. Symphorian\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres/the-martyrdom-of-st-symphorian-1834\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian is an 1834 painting by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It shows the death of Saint Symphorian, the first Christian martyr in Gaul. Painted in oil on canvas and measuring 407 x 339 cm, it is now in Autun Cathedral.\r Frustrated during the early part of his career by the need to paint portraits to earn a living, Ingres was determined to make his reputation in the more prestigious genre of history painting, which he considered to be his true calling. His ambition was fulfilled when his The Vow of Louis XIII achieved a triumphant success at the Salon of 1824. The painting's calm classicism\u2014which testified to Ingres' close study of Raphael and other old masters\u2014presented a challenge to the rising popularity of the romantic style exemplified by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. The critics came to regard Ingres as the standard-bearer of classicism against the romantic school\u2014a role he relished. Honors came his way; in January 1825 he was awarded the Cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur by Charles X, and in June 1825 he was elected to the Institute.\r During the period from 1824 to 1834 he painted few portraits, and concentrated on history painting. He received several important commissions for such works, such as the monumental The Apotheosis of Homer, commissioned in 1826.\r The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian was commissioned in December 1824 by the bishop of Autun, Monsignor de Vichy. It was intended to replace an altarpiece by Fra Bartolomeo (The Marriage of Saint Catherine; 1511) that had been confiscated to Paris during the Revolution. The subject of Ingres' painting was a youth who was beheaded ca. 160\u2013179 by for refusing to worship a pagan idol. Monsignor de Vichy gave Ingres a detailed program to follow in composing his picture, which Ingres followed closely. The painting depicts the Roman proconsul Heraclius and his guards seizing Saint Symphorian and ordering him to prostrate himself in the temple of the pagan goddess Cybele, or be killed. The saint's mother, overlooking the scene from the city wall above, urges him to have faith and face death gladly. He gives her a heartening look.\r Ingres began work on the project with the hope of finishing the painting in time to exhibit it in the Salon of 1827, but the work proceeded slowly. He prepared the composition in all its details with his usual care, ultimately producing more than 200 preparatory drawings and at least eleven studies in oils. He had not yet resolved the composition by the time of the July Revolution of 1830. Unsettled by the revolution, Ingres abandoned work on the project for a time, but by 1833 had returned to it with renewed vigor. The art historian Susan L. Siegfried contrasts the figure studies datable before 1830 with those made after the July Revolution, such as the two oil studies in the Fogg Art Museum (1833), in which \"Ingres incorporated all of the passion of his own reaction to the social upheaval\" and gave emphasis to \"the energy of the mob, painting a moral lesson for the public he abhorred\".\n", "\nArtist: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres\nArtwork Name: Antiochus and Stratonice\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres/antiochus-and-stratonice\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Sickness of Antiochus or Stratonice and Antiochus is an 1840 painting by the French artist Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. It is now in the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9 in Chantilly.\r In 1834 Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans commissioned a painting from Ingres to act as a pendant to Paul Delaroche's 1834 The Assassination of the Duke of Guise (now also in the mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9). That same year Ingres left for Rome to take up his post as director of the French Academy. This delayed work on the commission, which began with a c.1838 sketch (now in the Cleveland Museum of Art). According to Lady Egl\u00e9 Charlemont, she served as the model for Stratonice, Ingres' wife as the doctor, Hippolyte Flandrin for Antiochus' arms and Ingres himself for Seleucus.\r The painting was completed in Rome in 1840, with help from assistants: Victor Baltard, then studying architecture at the Academy, provided drawings for two of Ingres' pupils, Paul and Raymond Balze, to use in painting part of the architectural setting. The Duke of Orl\u00e9ans was satisfied with the work and paid Ingres 6000 francs and commissioned a portrait from him. The painting was exhibited in the gallery at the Palais-Royal and was inherited by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans' widow H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Mecklembourg-Schwerin on his death in 1842.\r After the 1848 Revolution, the painting was sold in Paris in 1852, when it was acquired by the Demidoff family for 63,000 francs. It was sold again in Paris in 1863, where it was bought for 93,000 francs by \u00c9douard Bocher, acting as intermediary for the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans' brother the duke of Aumale, then in exile in London. Aumale exhibited it in the salle de Tribune of his ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly, where it still is.\r The scene is one described in Plutarch's Life of Demetrius and also attested in the Bibliotheca historica of Diodorus Siculus, Lucian, Appian and Valerius Maximus. Antiochus was the son of Seleucus I Nicator. He fell in love with his father's new wife Stratonice of Syria, but kept this a secret despite falling mortally ill because of it. The doctor Erasistratus discovered the cause of Antiochus' sickness, since he became agitated and his heartbeat quickened when Stratonice entered the room. His father is thus shown collapsed at the foot of the bed.\r Ingres' teacher Jacques-Louis David had also painted the subject, in Erasistratus Discovering the Cause of Antiochus' Disease, the painting which won him the prix de Rome in 1774. Ingres had made several drawings after David's painting, the earliest dating to 1807.\r Another source may have been music and opera, since a lyre is shown in the foreground. The orchestre du Capitole de Toulouse produced \u00c9tienne-Nicolas M\u00e9hul's opera Stratonice several times whilst Ingres was a violinist with them. The painting shows the moment of the heroine's solo from M\u00e9hul's opera. The Assassination of the Duke of Guise was also based on an opera, Giacomo Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots.\r The decor and dress are partly inspired by ancient models, with Stratonice in particular very closely influenced by Roman sculpture. The bed is inspired by a 4th-century BC naiskos or funerary monument shown on a vase discovered at Canosa and published in 1816.\n", "\nArtist: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres\nArtwork Name: Odalisque with Slave\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres/odalisque-with-slave-1842\n\nWikipedia Article:\nOdalisque with Slave (French: L'Odalisque \u00e0 l'esclave) is an 1839 painting by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres commissioned by Charles Marcotte. Executed in oil on canvas, it depicts a nude odalisque, a musician, and a eunuch in a harem interior. The painting is in the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is a classic piece of Orientalism in French painting.\r Ingres painted a number of harem scenes during his long career, starting with the Grande Odalisque (1814). These works exemplify a taste for Orientalist subject matter shared by many French painters of the Romantic era, notably Ingres' rival Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. As Ingres never visited the Near East, Odalisque with Slave depicts an imaginary scene. It was composed in Rome, where the artist lived from 1835 to 1841 while serving as director of the French Academy there. The odalisque was painted from a life drawing Ingres had made years earlier. The musician was painted from a model posed in the studio, and many details such as the tanbour were derived from engravings.\r Ingres labored over the execution with his usual great care, and enlisted some of his students as assistants. One of them was Raymond Balze, who wrote of his experience:\r In September 1840 the painting was delivered to Paris, where it won praise from critics who viewed it in the owner's home. When exhibited publicly in 1845, the painting was widely admired, and written about by Baudelaire and Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger.\r Ingres made a second version in 1842 with the help of two of his students, Paul and Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin, which is at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore. In this version the background wall, described by art historian Karin Grimme as imprisoning the odalisque in \"a room with no exit\", was replaced with a garden painted by Paul Flandrin, inspired by the park at the Ch\u00e2teau de Dampierre.\r The Louvre owns a carefully finished drawing Ingres made in 1858 that replicates the 1839 composition.\n", "\nArtist: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Countess D'Haussonville\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres/portrait-of-countess-d-haussonville\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Comtesse d'Haussonville is an 1845 oil on canvas painting by the French Neoclassical artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres.\r The sitter, Louise de Broglie, Countess d'Haussonville, of the wealthy House of Broglie. The Princesse de Broglie, whom Ingres later portrayed c. 1851\u201353, was married to Louise's brother Albert de Broglie, the French monarchist politician, diplomat and writer. Highly educated, Louise de Broglie was later an essayist and biographer, and published historical romance novels based on the lives of Lord Byron, Robert Emmett and Margaret of Valois.\r The painting is one of the few portrait commissions Ingres accepted at the time, as he was more interested Neoclassical subject matter, which to his frustration was a far less lucrative source of income than portraiture. He had made a preparatory sketch and had begun an oil and canvas version two years earlier, but abandoned the commission when de Broglie became pregnant and was no longer able to pose for the long periods he required, and she had anyway found indeterminable and \"boring\". The final work is signed and dated at the lower left.\r By 1845 Ingres' fame was at its height, and he was much in demand as a portraitist. While lucrative, he found the format distracting from, and inferior to, his main interest of History painting. At the time, he committed to only two portraits; the current work and the Portrait of Baronne de Rothschild. Today, however, it is for portraits such as these for which he is best known.\r Louise de Broglie (1818-1882) was 27 at the time of the portrait. Ingres had two to three years earlier sketched her with black chalk as a preparatory drawing, and begun a oil on canvas painting, which excludes the mirror and reflected images, and reverses the pose, but that was abandoned. The sessions were long and slow, and de Broglie found them long and boring, at one stage complaining \"for the last nine days Ingres has been painting on one of the hands\". She fell pregnant with her third child, was thus unable to pose further, and the 1842 painting remains unfinished.\r Ever contrary, Ingres later complained that he was unhappy with de Broglie's final portrait, and that he had failed to fully capture her charms. He was relieved when the portrait was met with approval from her family, writing that \"family, friends, and above all the loving father [the duc de Broglie] were delighted with it...Finally to crown the work, M. Thiers - and I was not present - came to see it with the subject and repeated several times this wicked remark \"M Ingres must love you to have painted you that way. But all this does not make me proud, and I do not feel that I have conveyed all the graces of that charming model.\r The painting is composed from pale blue, grey, brown, gold and white hues. de Broglie is shown fully frontal, looking out at the viewer with a demure expression, the intensity of which has often been compared to his later portrait of Madame Moitessier.

The sitter, Betty de Rothschild (1805\u20131886) had married banker James Mayer de Rothschild and was one of the wealthiest women in Europe, and one of the foremost Parisian patrons of the arts. Her beauty and elegance were widely known and celebrated, and inspired Heinrich Heine's poem The Angel. For her portrait, which is painted in oil on canvas, Ingres sought to infuse symbols of her material wealth with the dignity, grace and beauty of Renaissance art, especially that of Raphael, while at the same time adhering to the command of line as practiced by Jan van Eyck. It is this combination which, according to art historians, places Ingres so far apart from his early modernist contemporaries.\r Betty de Rothschild's portrait is regarded as one of Ingres' most accomplished works, and has been described as \"perhaps the most sumptuous yet approachable image of mid-nineteenth-century opulence.\"\r She first asked Ingres to paint her in 1841 when he was much sought after as a reluctant portraitist. His ambition lay in history painting which he believed was a higher form of art, while his living lay in commissions for the nobility. At this point he was financially comfortable and refused. After meeting her at a ball and finding her highly charming, he agreed to the commission. In a letter of 26 June 1842 to his friend Jean-Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Gilibert, Ingres wrote: \"Tuesday, I have a definite sitting with Mme. de Rothschild, which came at the price of a dozen puerile and sincere letters. Long live portraits! may God damn them\u2026!\"\r The painting was not completed for another six years: there were false starts, and progress was interrupted while he took time to work on other portraits\u00a0\u2013 including his portrait of the late Ferdinand Philippe Henri the Duc d'Orleans who was killed in a carriage accident in 1842. Although Ingres had nearly finished Mme de Rothschild's head by February 1843, in June 1844 he made a new start. As the first version of the portrait is not known to survive, it is probable that Ingres scraped it down and painted the new version on top of it. In June 1847 he wrote: \"I have barely finished Mme. de Rothschild, begun again better, and the portrait of Mme Moitessier.\" The painting was completed in 1848.\r Rothschild wears a pink satin evening dress with rows of rutching at the hem and lace frills at the collar and sleeves, trimmed with ribbon bows. Her hair is smoothed over her ears and she wears a black velvet toque decorated with ostrich plumes. She is seated on a red velvet sofa, with her arms and legs crossed in a relaxed manner. Ingres has captured her in this painting as if she were attending a soir\u00e9e with friends.\r She is positioned unusually low in the pictorial plane, giving her a vulnerability at odds with the obvious stature offered by the heraldic inscription and coat of arms at the top right. The portrait is dominated two main elements: her wine-red satin robe and the charm of her facial expression and perfectly oval, almost idealised, face. While she looks out at the viewer with almost the same directness as Ingres' 1832 Portrait of Monsieur Bertin, the image is softened by the attractiveness of both her pose and dress. This warmth is contrasted by the sober and dull brown upper background, which serves to off-set the splendor of the sitter.\n", "\nArtist: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres\nArtwork Name: Venus Anadyomene\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres/venus-anadyomene\n\nWikipedia Article:\nVenus Anadyomene is a painting by the French painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It is now held at the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9, Chantilly, France. It is a female nude of the Venus Anadyomene type, showing the goddess Venus rising from the sea.\r Ingres began the painting in 1808 during his stay in Rome at the French Academy. The first preparatory drawings showed Venus kneeling, but this was later modified to the Venus Pudica position, standing but covering her breasts with her hands. The pose was inspired by Botticelli's The Birth of Venus - Ingres visited Florence and the Uffizi in 1805 and could have seen the painting there. A drawing of 1806 then shows the goddess with her arms in the air and her hair in her hands, a pose the artist also used in his 1856 The Source.\r The painting remained in the planning stages until 1848, when he completed it as a commission from the banker and botanist Benjamin Delessert. This involved major changes to the colour scheme Ingres had originally planned for the painting. However, in the end Delessert declined the painting since he felt the knee was drawn awkwardly. Later in 1848 the painting was sold to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Reiset, curator of drawings at the Louvre Museum. It was exhibited at the 1855 Exposition Universelle in Paris, where it was seen by the poet Charles Baudelaire \u2013 he argued that the head was inspired by classical sculpture, the hands by Raphael, and the narrow torso by medieval sculpture.\r In 1879 this painting and the rest of the Reiset collection were bought by Henri d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Aumale.

The portrait, which depicts Madame Moitessier seated, is now in the National Gallery in London. Madame Moitessier is also the title of a second portrait by Ingres, which depicts her standing; it was painted in 1851 and is now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C..\r Marie-Clotilde-In\u00e8s de Foucauld (1821\u20131897) was the daughter of a civil servant in the department of forests and waterways. In 1842 she married a widower twice her age, the rich banker and lace merchant Sigisbert Moitessier, thus becoming Madame Moitessier. In 1844 Ingres was approached through an intermediary with the idea of painting her portrait.\r Reluctant at this stage in his career to accept portrait commissions\u2014he considered portraiture to be a lower form of art than history painting\u2014he initially refused Sigisbert's request. However, when Ingres met Madame Moitessier, he was struck by her Junoesque beauty and agreed to produce a portrait.\r He began work on the seated version, which was originally to include the Moitessiers' daughter, Catherine. Work on the commission proceeded slowly. Ingres, finding little Catherine \"impossible\", eliminated her from the composition sometime around 1847. Work on the painting was suspended in 1849, when the death in June of Ingres' wife left him unable to work for several months, and Madame Moitessier was distracted by her second pregnancy and the death of her father. In June, 1851, having been reminded by the woman he called \"la belle et bonne\" (\"the beautiful and good\") that her portrait had still not been completed, Ingres began afresh, painting the standing portrait of her, which he finished in December 1851. He then returned to the seated portrait, which he completed in 1856.\r Characteristically, Ingres found inspiration in the art of the past when painting Madame Moitessier. The pose with a hand touching the cheek was taken from a fresco of Hercules and Telephus from Herculaneum that he may have seen in Naples in 1814, and which was familiar to him through engravings. A painting by Titian, Portrait of a Lady, may have inspired the profile in the mirror.\r Numerous drawn studies for both portraits exist. A study on canvas for the seated portrait, in which the figure has been drawn by Ingres and the background painted by an assistant, is in the Mus\u00e9e Ingres in Montauban.\n", "\nArtist: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres\nArtwork Name: The Source\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres/the-source-1856\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Source (French: La Source) is an oil painting on canvas by French neoclassical painter Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. The work was begun in Florence around 1820 and not completed until 1856, in Paris. When Ingres completed The Source, he was seventy-six years old, already famous, and president of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. The pose of the nude may be compared with that of another by Ingres, the Venus Anadyomene (1848), and is a reimagination of the Aphrodite of Cnidus or Venus Pudica. Two of Ingres' students, painters Paul Balze and Alexandre Desgoffe, helped to create the background and water jar.\r The painting depicts a nude standing upright between an opening in the rocks and holding in her hands a pitcher, from which water flows. She thus represents a water source or spring which, in classical literature, is sacred to the Muses and a source of poetic inspiration. She stands between two flowers, with their \"vulnerability to males who wish to pluck them\", and is framed by ivy, plant of Dionysus the god of disorder, regeneration, and ecstasy. The water she pours out separates her from the viewer, as rivers mark boundaries of which the crossing is symbolically important.\r Art historians Frances Fowle and Richard Thomson suggest that there is a \"symbolic unity of woman and nature\" in The Source, where the flowering plants and water serve as a background which Ingres fills with woman's \"secondary attributes\".\r The first exhibition of The Source was in 1856, the year it was completed. The painting was received enthusiastically. Duch\u00e2tel acquired the painting in 1857 for a sum of 25,000 francs. The state assumed title to the painting in 1878 and it passed to the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. In 1986 it was transferred to the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. The painting has been frequently exhibited and widely published.\r Haldane Macfall in A History of Painting: The French Genius describes The Source as Ingres' \"superb nude by which he is chiefly known\". Kenneth Clark in his book Feminine Beauty observed how The Source has been described as \"the most beautiful figure in French painting.\" Walter Friedl\u00e4nder in David to Delacroix referred to The Source simply as the most famous of Ingres' paintings.\r The model for the painting was the young daughter of Ingres' concierge. In his Confessions of a Young Man, Irish novelist George Moore wrote, with relation to the morality of artistic production, \"What care I that the virtue of some sixteen-year-old maid was the price for Ingres' La Source? That the model died of drink and disease in the hospital is nothing when compared with the essential that I should have La Source, that exquisite dream of innocence.\"\n", "\nArtist: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres\nArtwork Name: Delphine Ramel, Madame Ingres\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres/delphine-ramel-madame-ingres\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Madame Ingres is a late period oil on canvas painting by the French Neoclassical artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, completed in 1859.

It was probably painted to accompany Ingres's self-portrait of the same year, now in the Fogg Art Museum, Boston.\r Delphine was the daughter of Dominique Ramel (1777\u20131860), and the niece of Charles Marcotte d'Argenteuil.

It depicts a group of nude women in the bath of a harem, and is painted in a highly erotic style that evokes both the Near East and earlier western styles associated with mythological subject matter. Painted on canvas laid down on wood, it measures 108 x 108\u00a0cm.\r The work is signed and dated 1862, when Ingres was around 82 years old, and was completed in 1863. In that year Ingres altered the painting's original rectangular format, and cut the painting to its present tondo form. Photographs of the painting in its original format survive.\r It seems based on an April 1717 written description of a Turkish harem by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, where she mentions having viewed some two hundred nude women. The painting develops and elaborates a number of motifs Ingres had explored in earlier paintings, in particular his 1808 The Valpin\u00e7on Bather and Grande Odalisque of 1814.\r Its erotic content did not provoke a scandal, since for much its existence it has remained in private collections. It is now in the Louvre, Paris.\r The painting is known for its subtle colourisation, especially the very pale skin of the women resting in the privacy of a bathing area. The figures are given an almost abstract and \"slender and sinuous\" form, and seem at times to lack skeleton. They are arranged in a very harmonious, circular manner, a curved arrangement that heightens the eroticism of the painting. Its charge is in part achieved through the use of motifs that include the implied haze of Oriental perfume, and the inclusion of vases, running water, fruit and jewels, as well as a palette than ranges from pale white to pink, ivory, light greys and a variety of browns.\r Ingres relished the irony of producing an erotic work in his old age, painting an inscription of his age (AETATIS LXXXII, \"at age 82\") on the work \u2013 in 1867 he told others that he still retained \"all the fire of a man of thirty years\". He did not paint this work from live models, but from croquis and several of his earlier paintings, reusing 'bather' and 'odalisque' figures he had drawn or painted as single figures on beds or beside a bath.\r The figure from his The Valpin\u00e7on Bather appears almost identically as the central element of the later composition, but now plays a mandolin. The woman in the background with her arm extended and holding a cup of coffee resembles the sitter in his 1856 portrait of Marie-Clotilde-In\u00e8s Moitessier. The face of the woman with her arms raised above her head in the near right is similar to an 1818 croquis of the artist's wife, Delphine Ramel, though her right shoulder is lowered whereas her right arm is raised (an anatomical inconsistency usual in Ingres's work \u2013 La Grande Odalisque has three additional vertebrae). The other bodies are juxtaposed in various unlit areas behind them.\r Ingres's draws from a wide variety of painterly sources, including 19th-century academic art, Neoclassicism and late Mannerism. While at first look the painting might seem like a corporeal descent into wild abandon, it is in actuality very still, precise and geometrical throughout. The colourisation is one of \"chastising coolness\", while figures merge into each other in a manner that evokes sexuality, but ultimately is intended to show his skill at defying rational perspective Ingres invokes a setting that is both very real and only imaginary.\n", "\nArtist: Horace Vernet\nArtwork Name: Italian brigands surprised by papal troops\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/horace-vernet/italian-brigands-surprised-by-papal-troops-1831\n\nWikipedia Article:\nItalian Brigands Surprised by Papal Troops is an 1831 painting produced in Rome by Horace Vernet. It is kept at the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore.  The painter Horace Vernet came to Italy in 1829, when he was already a well-known artist. He remained there until 1834 and worked as the director of the French Academy in Rome.  During his travels, he made around 20 paintings with the same colorful subjects and episodes of local life in the Roman countryside. They were works comparable to other painters who traveled Italy and mixed artistic classicism with research into color and local costumes. Vernet was considered a leader among these French painters, making him the juste milieu between the traditions of Romanticism and Neoclassicism.  The painting was recorded in the \"John T. Johnston Collection\", which was sold by its owner to William T. Walters of Baltimore on 20 December 1876 for $10,110, the most expensive work in Johnston's collection. In 1894, it passed to Henry Walters. In 1931, one of Walters' heirs left it to its current owner, the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore. The painting underwent conservation treatments in 1938, 1969, 1981, and 1991.  The painting depicts a battle along a road by the side of a cliff between a band of brigands surprised by a patrol of Papal dragoons. They had been robbing a carriage, which is visible in the background of the street in the painting. Beyond the carriage, a strip of sea is visible.  In the foreground, two brigands are in the combat against two cavalry soldiers. The first is being grabbed by the handkerchief around his neck is about to receive a pistol blow, after having wounded the soldier's horse with the dagger in his right hand. The second has grabbed the bridle of the other soldier's horse and is about to be struck by the soldier's saber. A third brigand flees while holding in his hands two bags stolen from travelers, abandoning a third in the road. A fourth brigand fires a rifle at the soldiers, covering his companion's flight. Two women, depicted in typical local costumes, despair and implore in front of a small religious chapel at the side of the road.  Further back on the right side of the painting, other brigands stand along the slope of the hill, some fleeing and pulling with them a feminine figure in a long blue dress\u2014probably a passenger of the captured carriage. Others stand behind boulders, looking at the scene below. Along the road, a third cavalry soldier and some on foot fire at the fleeing brigands with muskets. The carriage in the background is empty, and a person and horse lie dead on the ground near its wheels.  The scene is realized in dramatic tones, following academic visual traditions with particular attention to the details of shades of color. The rocks in the background and the grey clouds in the sky magnify the drama of the action illuminated by the sun. The attention to the military subjects and the cavalry comes from the pictorial interest of Vernet's father, Carle Vernet. The unlikely palm tree depicted behind the chapel, amid the wild vegetation, add a touch of exoticism to the painting. Vernet made many paintings with Orientalist themes.\n", "\nArtist: Paul Delaroche\nArtwork Name: The Execution of Lady Jane Grey\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-delaroche/the-execution-of-lady-jane-grey-1833\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Execution of Lady Jane Grey is an oil painting by Paul Delaroche, completed in 1833, which is now in the National Gallery in London. It was enormously popular in the decades after it was painted, but in the 20th century realist historical paintings fell from critical favour and it was kept in storage for many decades, for much of which it was thought lost. Restored and displayed again since 1975, it immediately once again became a highly popular work, especially with younger visitors.\r The painting portrays, erroneously in some regards, the moments preceding the death of Lady Jane Grey, who on 10 July 1553 was proclaimed Queen of England, only to be deposed nine days later and executed in 1554. Jane is sometimes referred to as the \"Nine Days' Queen\" due to the brevity of her reign.\r Lady Jane Grey was the great-granddaughter of Henry VII of England and first cousin once removed to his grandson, the short-lived Edward VI. After Edward's death she was proclaimed queen, being given precedence over Henry VIII's daughters, Mary Tudor and Elizabeth. Two weeks after the death of her brother, Mary, who had the support of the English people, claimed the throne, which Jane relinquished, having reigned for only nine days. Jane, her husband Lord Guilford Dudley, and her father, were imprisoned in the Tower of London on charges of high treason. Jane's trial was conducted in November, but the death penalty handed to her was temporarily suspended. In February 1554, Jane's father, who had been released, was one of the rebel leaders in Wyatt's rebellion. On Friday 12 February, Mary had Jane, then aged 16, and her husband beheaded. Her father followed two days later.\r Delaroche painted the subject of Lady Jane's execution in 1833, nearly 300 years after the event, drawing upon contemporary historical sources to help him portray it accurately. Delaroche had built his reputation in the Paris salon with large, realistic portrayals of famous events from the previous few centuries. Despite the artist's familiarity with the painting of historical narratives, there are aspects of the painting which are inaccurate.\r The painting depicts the moment that Jane, blindfolded, is being assisted to lay her head upon the block for the executioner. Her outstretched hand reaches uncertainly down to find the block. She is being assisted by a man who is identified as John Brydges, 1st Baron Chandos. Chandos was a Lieutenant of the Tower at the time of Jane's execution. While imprisoned in the Tower, Jane was attended by ladies in waiting, one of whom was the nursemaid of her infancy. Two ladies in waiting are depicted in the painting, showing their grief at the event which is about to take place.\r The execution actually was conducted in the open air, in a part of the grounds of the Tower of London that is known as Tower Green, and where Henry VIII's wives Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard had been executed. The painting indicates either that Delaroche was not familiar with this aspect of the event and has constructed the location according to his historical knowledge of other such events, or that he chose to take a great deal of artistic license.\n", "\nArtist: Paul Delaroche\nArtwork Name: Napoleon crossing the Alps\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-delaroche/napoleon-crossing-the-alps-1850\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBonaparte Crossing the Alps (also called Napoleon Crossing the Alps, despite the existence of another, more well-known painting with that name) is an 1848\u20131850 oil-on-canvas portrait of Napoleon Bonaparte, by French artist Paul Delaroche. The painting depicts Bonaparte leading his army through the Alps on a mule, a journey Napoleon and his army of soldiers made in the spring of 1800, in an attempt to surprise the Austrian army in Italy. The two main versions of this painting that exist are in the Louvre in Paris and the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, England. Queen Victoria also obtained a reduced version of it.\r The work was inspired by Jacques-Louis David's series of five Napoleon Crossing the Alps paintings (1801\u20131805). David's works also show Napoleon's journey through the Great St. Bernard Pass, but there are significant stylistic differences between the two conceptions. Delaroche's Napoleon is cold and downcast, whereas David's wears a pristine uniform, and is idealized as a hero. Delaroche was commissioned to paint a realistic portrait; the style of which was emerging at the time.\r While the painting largely represented\u2014and was one of the pioneers of\u2014an emerging style, the work was criticised by several authorities on the subject. The reasons for this varied from Delaroche's depiction of the scene to a general disapproval of Delaroche himself. Many of those who were in the latter state of mind felt that Delaroche was trying to match the genius of Napoleon in some way, and had failed miserably in doing so.\r As part of his 1798 campaign during the French Revolutionary Wars, Napoleon prepared to invade and conquer Egypt, which was at the time a province of the Ottoman Empire. Such a military action promised numerous benefits, including securing French trade interests, and inhibiting British access to India. By 1 July 1798, Napoleon had landed on the shores of Egypt. After a lengthy chain of conflicts with heavy casualties, the campaign resulted in an Ottoman-British victory. Napoleon received news from France that Austrian forces had retaken Italy and he decided to return to Paris.\r In order to regain the upper hand, he planned to launch a surprise assault on the Austrian army stationed in the Cisalpine Republic. Based on the assumption the Austrians would never expect Napoleon's large force to be able to traverse the Alps, he chose that as his route. He selected the shortest route through the Alps, the Great St Bernard Pass, which would enable him to reach his destination as quickly as possible.\r On 15 May 1800, Napoleon and his army of 40,000\u2014not including the field artillery and baggage trains\u2014(35,000 light artillery and infantry, 5,000 cavalry) began the arduous journey through the mountains. During the five days spent traversing the pass, Napoleon's army consumed almost 22,000 bottles of wine, more than a tonne and a half of cheese, and around 800 kilograms of meat.\r Following his crossing of the Alps, Napoleon commenced military operations against the Austrian army. Despite an inauspicious start to the campaign, the Austrian forces were driven back to Marengo after nearly a month. There, a large battle took place on 14 June, which resulted in the Austrian evacuation of Italy.\n", "\nArtist: Eugene Delacroix\nArtwork Name: The Barque of Dante (Dante and Virgil in the Underworld)\nArtwork Genre: literary painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix/the-barque-of-dante-dante-and-virgil-in-the-underworld-1822-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Barque of Dante (French: La Barque de Dante), sometimes known as Dante and Virgil in Hell (Dante et Virgile aux enfers), is the first major painting by the French artist Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, and one of the works signalling a shift in the character of narrative painting from Neo-Classicism towards the Romantic movement. It was completed for the opening of the Salon of 1822 and currently hangs in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris.\r The painting is loosely based on fictional events taken from canto eight of Dante\u2019s Inferno. A leaden, smoky mist and the blazing City of the Dead form the backdrop against which the poet Dante endures a fearful crossing of the River Styx. He is steadied by the learned poet of antiquity Virgil as they plough through waters heaving with tormented souls.\r The arrangement of figures is for the most part compliant with the tenets of the cool, reflective Neo-Classicism that had dominated French painting for nearly four decades. There is a group of central upright figures, and a rational arrangement of subsidiary figures, all in horizontal planes, and observing studied poses.\r The Barque of Dante was an artistically ambitious work, and although the composition is conventional, the painting in some important respects broke unmistakably free of the French Neo-Classical tradition.\r The smoke to the rear and the fierce movement of the garment in which the oarsman Phlegyas is wrapped indicate a strong wind, and most of the individuals in the painting are facing into it. The river is choppy and the boat is lifted to the right, a point at which it is twisted toward the viewer. The party is driven to a destination known to be yet more inhospitable, by an oarsman whose sure-footed poise in the storm suggests his familiarity with these wild conditions. The city behind is a gigantic furnace. There is neither comfort nor a place of refuge in the painting\u2019s world of rage, insanity and despair.\r The painting explores the psychological states of the individuals it depicts, and uses compact, dramatic contrasts to highlight their different responses to their respective predicaments. Virgil\u2019s detachment from the tumult surrounding him, and his concern for Dante\u2019s well-being, is an obvious counterpoint to the latter\u2019s fear, anxiety, and physical state of imbalance. The damned are either rapt in a piercing concentration upon some mad and gainless task, or are else apparently in a state of total helplessness and loss. Their lining of the boat takes an up-and-down wave-like form, echoing the choppy water and making the foot of the painting a region of perilous instability. The souls to the far left and right are like grotesque bookends, enclosing the action and adding a claustrophobic touch to the whole.\r Delacroix wrote that his best painting of a head in this picture is that of the soul reaching with his forearm from the far side into the boat. Both Charles Le Brun\u2019s, La Col\u00e8re of 1668, and John Flaxman\u2019s line engraving The Fiery Sepulchres, appearing as plate\u00a011 in The Divine Poem of Dante Alighieri, 1807, are likely sources for this head.\n", "\nArtist: Eugene Delacroix\nArtwork Name: The Massacre at Chios\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix/scenes-from-the-massacre-of-chios-1822\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  The Massacre at Chios (French: Sc\u00e8ne des massacres de Scio) is the second major oil painting by the French artist Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. The work is more than four meters tall, and shows some of the horror of the wartime destruction visited on the Island of Chios in the Chios massacre. A frieze-like display of suffering characters, military might, ornate and colourful costumes, terror, disease and death is shown in front of a scene of widespread desolation.  Unusual for a painting of civil ruin during this period, The Massacre at Chios has no heroic figure to counterbalance the crushed victims, and there is little to suggest hope among the ruin and despair. The vigour with which the aggressor is painted, contrasted with the dismal rendition of the victims has drawn comment since the work was first hung, and some critics have charged that Delacroix might have tried to show some sympathy with the brutal occupiers. The painting was completed and displayed at the Salon of 1824 and presently hangs at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in Paris.  A military attack on the inhabitants of Chios by Ottoman forces commenced on 11 April 1822 and was prosecuted for several months into the summer of the same year. The campaign resulted in the deaths of twenty thousand citizens, and the forced deportation into slavery of almost all the surviving seventy thousand inhabitants.  Delacroix had been greatly impressed by his fellow Parisien Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault's The Raft of the Medusa, a painting for which he himself modeled as the young man at the front with the outstretched arm. The pyramidal arrangement that governs G\u00e9ricault's painting is similarly seen with the figures in the foreground of The Massacre at Chios. On this unlikely layout of characters, Delacroix commented, \"One must fill up; if it is less natural, it will be more beautiful and f\u00e9cond. Would that everything should hold together!\" The dense assembly of characters at the front is in marked contrast to the open and dispersed spaces behind them. Land and sea, light and shade run appear as bands of drifting colours listlessly running into each other, and Delacroix appears to abandon the laws of perspective altogether with his rendering of clouds. The complete effect of this background is to suggest a constant opening out, dissolution and centrelessness. Aesthetician Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin identified this technique, and classified it a\u00a0tectonic form.  The thirteen civilians\u2014men, women and children\u2013have been rounded up for slaughter or enslavement. They are harshly presented to the viewer in an almost flat plane; slumped, disordered, and unevenly distributed. Their arrangement principally comprises two human pyramids\u2013one pyramid to the left of the canvas culminating in the man with the red fez, and the other to the right culminating in the mounted soldier. The area between the two pyramids contains two soldiers in shadow, and two more Greek victims\u2013a young man embraced by a young woman. The two men in the pyramid to the left are injured. The man at the front is on or near to the point of death, and the man poised at the top of the group appears unable to prepare a defence for himself. His gaze is in the direction of the suffering children in front of him, but it does not fall on them. This seeming detachment, coupled with the vacant stare of the dying man lend to this group an air of despondent resignation.\n", "\nArtist: Eugene Delacroix\nArtwork Name: Seated Nude, Mademoiselle Rose\nArtwork Genre: nude painting (nu)\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix/seated-nude-mademoiselle-rose-1824\n\nWikipedia Article:\nMademoiselle Rose (also Seated Nude) is a painting by French Romantic artist Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, regarded as the leader of the French Romantic school. This nude was painted before 1824, and is currently held and exhibited at the Louvre in Paris. Another is at the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin.\r The model is seen from the side, seated on a kind of wooden pedestal half covered with a piece of red material. Her left foot rests on a wooden block; her head is turned towards the artist and is therefore seen full face.\r This nude is painted in a somewhat awkward studio pose. The sitter has been identified (but without certainty) as Mademoiselle Rose, an artists' model who according to Alfred Robaut, Delacroix's biographer, posed several times for him and for Richard Parkes Bonington, and who perhaps distributed her favours impartially between the two artists. In a letter to his friend Pierret, usually dated 1820, Delacroix wrote:\r This particular nude is represented with an almost naturalistic sincerity, without any decorative arrangement. Although it already displays the variations of light on flesh which interested the artist so deeply, the pigment, applied in masterly touches in a granular impasto, has not yet acquired the fluidity which was to owe to the influence of English painting. This first made itself felt at the salon of 1824, where Delacroix saw works by John Constable, and increased in 1825, the date of his visit to London.\r The upward trend of his work, clearly seen in this painting, brings its date to the period 1820-1822, but cannot be fixed precisely. However, the nude has not only a pictorial interest: Delacroix brings to the painting an emotion which is firmly rooted in Romanticism. Moreover, the slight timidity of the attitude, the somewhat anxious expression of the face, give to this life-class painting a quality of humanity that is purely French Romantic.\n", "\nArtist: Eugene Delacroix\nArtwork Name: The Orphan Girl at the Cemetery\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix/the-orphan-girl-at-the-cemetery-1824\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Orphan Girl at the cemetery (also known as Young Orphan Girl in the Cemetery; French: Jeune orpheline au cimeti\u00e8re) (c. 1823 or 1824) is a painting by the French artist Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix.\r Believed to be a preparatory work in oil for the artist's later Massacre at Chios, Orphan Girl at the Cemetery is nevertheless considered a masterpiece in its own right. An air of sorrow and fearfulness emanates from the picture, and tears well from the eyes of the grief-stricken girl as she looks apprehensively upward. The dimness of the sky and the abandoned laying-ground are consonant with her expression of melancholy. The girl's body language and clothing evoke tragedy and vulnerability: the dress drooping down from her shoulder, a hand laid weakly on her thigh, the shadows above the nape of her neck, the darkness at her left side, and the cold and pale coloring of her attire. All these are combined to emphasize a sense of loss, of unreachable hope, her isolation, and the absence of any means of help, as she is also looking on toward an unseen and unknown spectacle or spectre.\r For Delacroix, colors were the most important ingredients for his paintings. Because of this artistic taste and belief, he did not have the patience to create facsimiles of classical statues. He revered Peter Paul Rubens and the Venetians. He chose the use of colorful hues and exotic themes for his paintings, drawing inspiration from other inspirational places, resulting in works described as glossy and abundant with movement.\r The Young Orphan Girl in the Cemetery, an alternate title for the painting, is currently curated at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in Paris, France.\n", "\nArtist: Eugene Delacroix\nArtwork Name: Greece expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting,history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix/greece-expiring-on-the-ruins-of-missolonghi-1826\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGreece on the Ruins of Missolonghi (French: La Gr\u00e8ce sur les ruines de Missolonghi) is an 1826 oil painting by French painter Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, and now preserved at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux. This painting was inspired by the Third Siege of Missolonghi by the Ottoman forces in 1826, during which many people of the city after the long-time siege (almost a year) decided to attempt a mass breakout (sortie) to escape famine and epidemics. The attempt resulted in a disaster, with the larger part of the Greeks slain.\r Greece is depicted as a kneeling woman who occupies the major part of the painting. She is wearing a traditional Greek costume, her chest being widely bare, and she spreads her arms as a sign of sadness. The hand of a dead victim can be seen protruding from the rubble, beneath her feet. In the background, a dark-complexioned man wearing a yellow turban, who symbolizes the enemy, is planting a flag in the ground.\r The painting borrows elements from Christianity. Indeed, \"Greece adopts the attitude of praying in the early centuries of Christianity. The blue coat and white robe, traditionally attributed to the Immaculate Conception, reinforces this analogy to a secular figure of Mary here. The strength of the image is the sharp contrast between the traditional allegory which induces an idealization of the model, and processing of the scene without any concession to the ideal.\"\n", "\nArtist: Eugene Delacroix\nArtwork Name: Death of Sardanapalus\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix/death-of-sardanapalus-1827-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Death of Sardanapalus (La Mort de Sardanapale) is an oil painting on canvas by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, dated 1827. It currently hangs in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris. A smaller replica, painted by Delacroix in 1844, is now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\r The Death of Sardanapalus is based on the tale of Sardanapalus, the last king of Assyria, from the historical library of Diodorus Siculus, the ancient Greek historian, and is a work of the era of Romanticism. This painting uses rich, vivid and warm colours, and broad brushstrokes. It was inspired by Lord Byron's play Sardanapalus (1821), and in turn inspired a cantata by Hector Berlioz, Sardanapale (1830), and also Franz Liszt's opera, Sardanapale (1845\u201352, unfinished).\r The main focus of Death of Sardanapalus is a large bed draped in rich red fabric. On it lies a man overseeing a scene of chaos with a disinterested eye. He is dressed in flowing white fabrics and sumptuous gold around his neck and head. A woman lies dead at his feet, prone across the lower half of the large bed. She is one of five or six in the scene, all in various shades of undress, and all in assorted throes of death by the hands of the half dozen men in the scene. There are several people being stabbed with knives and one man is dying from a self-inflicted wound from a sword, and a man in the left foreground is attempting to kill an intricately adorned horse. A young man by the king\u2019s right elbow is standing behind a side table which has an elaborate golden decanter and a cup. There are golden elephant heads at the base of the bed, as well as various valuable trinkets scattered amongst the carnage. In the background, several architectural elements are visible but difficult to discern.\r Delacroix used a painterly brushstroke in this painting, which allows for a strong sense of movement in the work. This scene is chaotic and violent, as showcased by the movement, weapons, and the colors used. The redness of the bed stands out against the somewhat obscured, dark background. The whiteness of Sardanapalus\u2019s robe, the creamy lines of the dying women\u2019s limbs, and the shimmers of gold objects throughout the scene pull the viewer\u2019s eye quickly around the painting.\r There is asymmetry in the work, but the composition remains balanced. One woman reclined by an elephant head on the end of the bed is the only figure to engage with the viewer. Everyone else in the painting is focused on the task at hand: death.\r Delacroix\u2019s Death of Sardanapalus was controversial and polarizing at its exhibition at the Paris Salon of 1828 for one significant reason: it was not a Neoclassical painting. Delacroix\u2019s main figural subject was Sardanapalus, a king willing to destroy all of his possessions, including people and luxurious goods, in a funerary pyre of gore and excess. This man was not a hero, like the Horatii in Jacques-Louis David\u2019s painting. Delacroix\u2019s Sardanapalus was the antithesis of neoclassical traditions, which favored subdued colors, rigid space, and an overall moral subject matter. He also used foreshortening to tilt the death scene directly into the space of the audience, a far cry from the subdued order of traditional academic paintings. Dorothy Bussy quotes one critic of the work as calling the painting \"the fanaticism of ugliness\" when it appeared in the Salon in 1828.\n", "\nArtist: Eugene Delacroix\nArtwork Name: Liberty Leading the People\nArtwork Genre: history painting,symbolic painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix/the-liberty-leading-the-people-1830\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLiberty Leading the People (French: La Libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple [la lib\u025b\u0281te \u0261id\u0251\u0303 l\u0259 p\u0153pl]) is a painting by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix commemorating the July Revolution of 1830, which toppled King Charles X of France. A woman personifying the concept and the Goddess of Liberty leads the people forward over a barricade and the bodies of the fallen, holding the flag of the French Revolution \u2013 the tricolour flag, which remains France's national flag \u2013 in one hand and brandishing a bayonetted musket with the other. The figure of Liberty is also viewed as a symbol of France and the French Republic known as Marianne.\r By the time Delacroix painted Liberty Leading the People, he was already the acknowledged leader of the Romantic school in French painting. Delacroix, who was born as the Age of Enlightenment was giving way to the ideas and style of romanticism, rejected the emphasis on precise drawing that characterised the academic art of his time, and instead gave a new prominence to freely brushed colour.\r Delacroix painted his work in the autumn of 1830. In a letter to his brother dated 21 October, he wrote: \"My bad mood is vanishing thanks to hard work. I\u2019ve embarked on a modern subject\u2014a barricade. And if I haven\u2019t fought for my country at least I\u2019ll paint for her.\" The painting was first exhibited at the official Salon of 1831.\r Delacroix depicted Liberty as both an allegorical goddess-figure and a robust woman of the people. The mound of corpses acts as a kind of pedestal from which Liberty strides, barefoot and bare-breasted, out of the canvas and into the space of the viewer. The Phrygian cap she wears had come to symbolize liberty during the first French Revolution, of 1789\u201394. The painting has been seen as a marker to the end of the Age of Enlightenment, as many scholars see the end of the French Revolution as the start of the romantic era.\r The fighters are from a mixture of social classes, ranging from the bourgeoisie represented by the young man in a top hat, a student from the prestigious \u00c9cole Polytechnique wearing the traditional bicorne, to the revolutionary urban worker, as exemplified by the boy holding pistols. What they have in common is the fierceness and determination in their eyes. Aside from the flag held by Liberty, a second, minute tricolore can be discerned in the distance flying from the towers of Notre Dame.\r The identity of the man in the top hat has been widely debated. The suggestion that it was a self-portrait by Delacroix has been discounted by modern art historians. In the late 19th century, it was suggested the model was the theatre director \u00c9tienne Arago; others have suggested the future curator of the Louvre, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Villot; but there is no firm consensus on this point.\r Several of the figures are probably borrowed from a print by popular artist Nicolas Charlet, a prolific illustrator who Delacroix believed captured, more than anyone else, the peculiar energy of the Parisians.\r The French government bought the painting in 1831 for 3,000 francs with the intention of displaying it in the throne room of the Palais du Luxembourg as a reminder to the \"citizen-king\" Louis-Philippe of the July Revolution, through which he had come to power. This plan did not come to fruition and the canvas hung in the palace's museum gallery for a few months, before being removed due to its inflammatory political message. After the June Rebellion of 1832, it was returned to the artist.

The second work, painted fifteen years later between 1847 and 1849, is located at the Musee Fabre, Montpellier, France. The two works both depict the same scene of four women together in an enclosed room. Despite the similar setting, the two paintings evoke completely different moods through the depiction of the women. Delacroix's earlier 1834 work captures the separation between the women and the viewer. The second painting instead invites the viewer into the scene through the warm inviting gaze of the woman.\r Women of Algiers, along with Delacroix's other Orientalist paintings, has inspired many artists of later generations. In 1888 both Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin travelled to Montpellier to view Delacroix's 1849 version of Women of Algiers. The painting served as a source of inspiration to the later impressionists, and a series of 15 paintings and numerous drawings by Pablo Picasso in 1954.\r The 1834 painting was first displayed at the 1834 Salon in Paris, where it received mixed reviews. The art critic Gustave Plance wrote in a review for Revue des deux mondes that Delacroix's painting Femmes d'Alger dans leur Appartement was about painting and nothing more, painting that is fresh, vigorous, advanced with spirit, and of an audacity completely venetian, yet yielding nothing to the masters it recalls. King Louis Philippe purchased the painting in 1834 and presented it to the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg. In 1874 the painting was moved to the Louvre, Paris where it remains today as part of the permanent collection.\r The work depicts four women enclosed in a lavishly decorated room. Three of the women are sumptuously adorned with loose, billowing garments and gold jewellery. One woman has a pink flower in her hair. The fourth woman is a black slave who exits the scene, looking over her left shoulder towards the seated women. Delacroix perfectly rendered the features of the women's clothing, adornments, and the interior decor in great detail. This attention to details follows through from his 1832 Algerian sketches into the 1834 oil painting of the same scene. The painting has been applauded by scholars for its attempted ethnographic depiction, both in the relatively clothed forms of the females and the title of the painting itself, as it is devoid of the objectifying terms odalisque or harem. Delacroix's Women of Algiers does not depict an overtly eroticized version of the Oriental female, as other artists did, such as Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres' salacious depiction in his 1814 painting Grande Odalisque.\r Although there is a desire for realism to evoke the decorative mood, the work fails to extend the desire for realism to the women themselves, and the social customs of the harem. There is almost no narrative in the stagnant space. The women are cloistered together, not engaging with one another. The challenging stare of the women on the left reflects hostility towards the permeation of the private space. Aside from this glance there is no depiction of the nineteenth century social customs of the harems of elite Algerian culture. Ultimately Delacroix's stolen glance into the Algerian harem provided him with little visual information to create a realistic image.\n", "\nArtist: Eugene Delacroix\nArtwork Name: Frederic Chopin\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix/frederic-chopin-1838\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and George Sand was an 1838 unfinished oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. Originally a double portrait, it was later cut in two and sold off as separate pieces. It showed composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin (1810\u201349) playing piano while writer George Sand (1804\u201376) sits to his right, listening and smoking a cigar (a favorite activity of hers). The sitters were lovers at the time, and both were close friends of the artist.\r The portrait remained in Delacroix's studio until his death. Shortly afterward, it was cut into two separate works, both of which are tightly focused. Chopin's portrait comprises only a head shot, while Sand's shows her upper body but is narrowly cut. This led to the loss of large areas of the original canvas. The reason for the divide is likely the then-owner's belief that two paintings would sell for a higher price than one. Today Chopin's portrait is housed at the Louvre in Paris, while Sand's hangs at Copenhagen's Ordrupgaard Museum.\r George Sand was a French Romantic novelist, one of the first female French writers to establish an international reputation. She became known for behavior unusual for a woman at the time, including openly conducting affairs, smoking a pipe and wearing men's clothing. Sand had been a friend of Delacroix for a number of years, though the painter did not hold her work in high regard. She met Chopin in 1836 and from 1838 conducted a relationship with him for ten years, until two years before he died. Much of the composer's best work was done during those ten years. Though their relationship began as physical, Chopin's failing health (described in Sand's autobiographical \"Winter in Mallorca\") in time changed her role to that of caregiver.\r Sand introduced Delacroix to Chopin in 1838, and the two men remained close friends until the composer's death. The double portrait showed Chopin playing piano while Sand sat and listened. Little is known of the painting's origin or the circumstances of its execution. It is not known whether it was a commission or intended as a gift to the composer. It is known that Delacroix borrowed a piano so that the work could be painted in his studio. The double portrait was not finished, and ironically one of the elements that was not painted was the piano.\r The Sand canvas is generally seen as the more interesting because, in its original form, it was intended as a counterpoint to the Chopin portrait, not as a stand-alone work. As such, it contravenes many conventions of portraiture. It was usual in 19th-century bust-sized paintings for the subject to be largely static, but here Sand is shown reacting to the music Chopin is playing, and highly animated and energetic in her emotional response.\n", "\nArtist: Eugene Delacroix\nArtwork Name: The Crusaders' entry into Constantinople, 12th April 1204\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix/the-crusaders-entry-into-constantinople-12th-april-1204-1840-oil-on-canvas-1840\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Entry of the Crusaders in Constantinople (Entr\u00e9e des Crois\u00e9s \u00e0 Constantinople) or The Crusaders Entering Constantinople is a large painting by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. It was commissioned by Louis-Philippe in 1838, and completed in 1840. Painted in oil on canvas, it is in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in Paris.\r Delacroix's painting depicts a famous episode of the Fourth Crusade (12 April 1204), in which the Crusaders abandoned their plan to invade Muslim Egypt and Jerusalem, and instead sacked the Christian (Eastern Orthodox) city of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. The painting shows Baldwin I of Constantinople at the head of a procession through the streets of the city following the assault; on all sides are the city's inhabitants who beg for mercy.\r The painting's luminosity and use of colour owes much to Delacroix's study of the Old Masters, such as Paolo Veronese. The painting was exhibited in the Salon of 1841, where the painterly romanticism of its style was controversial; Le Constitutionnel deplored \"the confused and strangled composition, the dull earthy colours and the lack of definite contours\", but Baudelaire appreciated the work's \"abstraction faite\".\n", "\nArtist: Eugene Delacroix\nArtwork Name: Ovid among the Scythians\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix/ovid-among-the-scythians-1859\n\nWikipedia Article:\nOvid among the Scythians (1859 and 1862) is the title of two oil paintings by French artist Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. The less famous second version was painted to integrate the figures and landscape and rectified the problems of scale of the first version, which had an unusual composition and strange scale of the characters, provoking negative criticism, even among Delacroix's admirers such as Baudelaire and Gautier, although artists like Edgar Degas were deeply impressed.\r Delacroix painted this subject first in 1844 as part of the decorations for the ceiling of the Library of the Palais Bourbon in Paris. They depict the life of the Ancient Roman poet Ovid when exiled by the Emperor Augustus to the Black Sea port of Tomis, in what was then part of Scythia and is now south east Romania, where he spent his last eight years and wrote poems such as Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto. The Scythians were an ancient Iranian people whose way of life was described by Herodotus in his Histories as \"nomadic\" and Ovid himself called them a \"wild tribe\".\r However, with its cultured man standing before barbarous people, the 1859 picture show the Scythians treating the poet with sympathy and curiosity, and is a fine treatment of the theme of civilisation confronted with barbarity. Henri Loyrette wrote:\r The first version was exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1859, the last in which Delacroix participated. The composition reinterprets ideas that Delacroix had previously used in decorative compositions such as The Massacre at Chios, Death of Sardanapalus and Entry of the Crusaders in Constantinople. At the time of its exhibition, the landscape with its mountains was \"universally\" praised, while the mare in the foreground was thought strange by some. Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, for example, admired the painting, but ironically called the mare la femelle du cheval de Troie (\"the female of the trojan horse\"). Maxime Du Camp was the author of the harshest criticism, calling the painting \"a spectacle of irremissible decadence\" and advising the painter \"to return to the literary works that he loves and to the music for which he was certainly born\". Baudelaire, in his last Salon criticism, called the painting \"one of these amazing works\" and saying \"Delacroix knows the design and painting\", and also wrote a long essay on the life of an exiled poet and also quoting Chateaubriand's epic Les Martyrs to evoke \"the landscape, its solitude, its calm charm\". Zacharie Astruc, in his first Salon criticism, praised all the details in the picture: Ovid (\"what noble elegance!\"); the mare (\"what color and air around it!\"); the dog, which made him think about classical sculpture; the water (\"a strange beauty\"); and, above all, the landscape. In the catalog, by Delacroix himself, was written: \"Some examine him [Ovid] with interest, others go home and offer wild fruit and mare's milk, etc., etc.\"\r The wildness and the misunderstood genius were key concepts in Romanticism and are very well portrayed in these two paintings by Delacroix. The second version, contrary to what one might think, is not an oil sketch but a completed version which develops many elements of the London work. Delacroix painted it with more vivid colors, replaced the barbarian with a shield on the back by a woman bringing food, and also closely integrated the figures and landscape in a manner that is more in keeping with a historical landscape. It was painted a year before his death, in 1862, most probably for a private collector. It was given to Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, in honour of Philippe de Montebello, in 2008. According to Gary Tinterow, the Metropolitan\u2019s curator of 19th-century, Modern and contemporary art: \"this is his late, final statement on a theme that interested him his whole life.\"\n", "\nArtist: Alexandre Cabanel\nArtwork Name: Birth of Venus\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexandre-cabanel/birth-of-venus-1863\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Birth of Venus (French: Naissance de Venus) is a painting by the French artist Alexandre Cabanel. It was painted in 1863, and is now in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris. A second and smaller version (85 x 135.9\u00a0cm) from ca. 1864 is in Dahesh Museum of Art. A third (106 x 182.6\u00a0cm) version dates from 1875; it is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\r Shown to great success at the Paris Salon of 1863, The Birth of Venus was immediately purchased by Napoleon III for his own personal collection. That same year Cabanel was made a professor of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.\r Cabanel's erotic imagery, cloaked in historicism, appealed to the propriety of the higher levels of society. Art historian and curator Robert Rosenblum wrote of Cabanel's The Birth of Venus that \"This Venus hovers somewhere between an ancient deity and a modern dream\"; he described \"the ambiguity of her eyes, that seem to be closed but that a close look reveals that she is awake ... A nude who could be asleep or awake is specially formidable for a male viewer\".\r Cabanel was a determined opponent of the Impressionists, especially \u00c9douard Manet, although the refusal of the academic establishment to realize the importance of new ideas and sources of inspiration would eventually prove to be the undoing of the Academy.\r At the Salon of 1863, The Birth of Venus was one of a multitude of female nudes. Bathed in opalescent colors, the goddess Venus shyly looks to the viewer from beneath the crook of her elbow. Two years later, Manet presented his now renowned painting Olympia at the Salon as well. Today both hang in the Musee\u2019d\u2019 Orsay. Unlike Venus\u2019s ethereal-like palette, Manet painted Olympia with pale, placid skin tone, and darkly outlined the figure. Her only seemingly modest gesture is her placement of her hand over her leg, though it is not out of shyness- one must pay before they can see. James Rubin writes of the two works: \u201cThe Olympia is often compared to Cabanel\u2019s Birth of Venus, for the latter is a far more sexually appealing work, despite its mythological guise\u2026 It is evident Manet\u2019s demythologizing of the female nude was foremost a timely reminder of modern realities. The majority of critics attacked the painting with unmitigated disgust\u2026: \u201cWhat is this odalisque with the yellow belly, ignoble model dredged up from who knows where?\u201d [And] \u201cThe painter\u2019s attitude is of inconceivable vulgarity.\u201d\r Cabanel depicts personality, but in subtle ways through her relaxed posture and sleepy expression. Jenna-Marie Newberry writes of Venus: \u201cThe lightest of color used in The Birth of Venus alludes to the lightness and enlightenment of relaxation, amplifying the reclining nude\u2019s placid demeanor and virginity. The contraposto twist of the figure with the melodramatic swoop of the arm over the face comes directly from his previous paintings \u2026 Venus herself takes over the entire front of the picture plane. Her hair has been deepened, adding more to her allure and purity.\u201d It is as if the viewer is catching a glimpse of a goddess simply basking in the nature that enfolds her. She is calm, and asks nothing with her gaze. She is a part of her surroundings and the viewer is privy to behold upon the scene. By adhering to the accepted canon of the day, Cabanel produced a quite seductive painting of a mythological beauty presented in a calculated way that was acceptable for viewers at the time of its creation. Following the Salon it was said: \u201cHis dark-eyed heroines, thinly painted, usually in muted colors and immaculately drawn, were popular on both sides of the Atlantic\u201d.\n", "\nArtist: Alexandre Cabanel\nArtwork Name: Cleopatra Testing Poisons on Those Condemned to Death\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexandre-cabanel/cleopatra-testing-poisons-on-those-condemned-to-death\n\nWikipedia Article:\nCleopatra Testing Poisons on Condemned Prisoners (Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre essayant des poisons sur des condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 mort) is an 1887 painting by the French artist Alexandre Cabanel.

The work was originally commissioned by the French courtesan La Pa\u00efva but she was unhappy with the finished painting and returned it to G\u00e9r\u00f4me. It was exhibited at the Salon of 1866 and the Royal Academy of Arts in 1871.\r G\u00e9r\u00f4me's painting is one of the earliest modern depictions of Cleopatra emerging from a carpet in the presence of Julius Caesar, a minor historical inaccuracy that arose out of the translation of a scene from Plutarch's Life of Caesar and the semantic change of the word \"carpet\" over time. The work is considered a classic example of Egyptomania and was mass-produced by Goupil, allowing it to reach a wide audience.\r The painting was held by California banker Darius Ogden Mills and remained in the Mills family art collection for over a century until it was sold to a private collector in 1990.\r Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me (1824\u20131904) was a nineteenth century French painter and sculptor. At the age of twenty-three, he came to the attention of the art world at the Salon of 1847 with The Cock Fight (1846), a Neo-Grec painting that was praised by Th\u00e9ophile Gautier. With works informed by his frequent travels throughout the Middle East and visits to Egypt, G\u00e9r\u00f4me specialized in historical and Orientalist painting and became known as a leader of the Academic art movement. According to historian Charles Sowerwine, G\u00e9r\u00f4me\r French writer Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e first proposed the subject of Cleopatra and Caesar in a letter sent to G\u00e9r\u00f4me in December 1860. La Pa\u00efva, a wealthy French courtesan, later commissioned the painting from G\u00e9r\u00f4me, intending it for display in the H\u00f4tel de la Pa\u00efva, her mansion on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. According to American art critic Earl Shinn, the work was originally painted on silk and was designed as a \"transparency to be lowered or raised midway of a long saloon\" in La Pa\u00efva's mansion, \"which it was desirable to divide occasionally into two\".\r G\u00e9r\u00f4me made at least two previous oil paintings and a number of sketches in preparation for the work. One shows Cleopatra lying on the ground stretching out to Julius Caesar with Apollodorus crouching behind her. In one variation before the finished version, Caesar is shown by himself with his hands on the desk (instead of outstretched) without his four secretaries. When the work was finished in 1866, Cleopatra's position changed to show her standing before Caesar with Apollodorus bent down beside her.\r G\u00e9r\u00f4me painted the scene based on the meeting between Cleopatra and Caesar written in the Life of Caesar by Greek historian Plutarch (c. AD 46 \u2013 AD 120) more than a century after the incident took place. Even though G\u00e9r\u00f4me visited Egypt in 1857, where George W. Whiting of Rice University notes \"he acquired numerous abundant local color and exact detail\" that informed the painting of Cleopatra and Caesar, the Egyptian background setting in the work is derived from a plate in a volume from the Description de l'\u00c9gypte (1809\u201329) that depicts a temple at Deir el-Medina.\n", "\nArtist: Jean-Leon Gerome\nArtwork Name: Bonaparte Before the Sphinx\nArtwork Genre: landscape,portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-leon-gerome/bonaparte-before-the-sphinx-1868\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBonaparte Before the Sphinx (French: Bonaparte devant le Sphinx) is an 1886 painting by the French artist Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me.

One critic called it \"the greatest painting of our generation\". Purchased for 35,000 francs by the American art collector and speculator John Wolfe on 26 June, 1873, it was displayed in his mansion for many years alongside other high-style French academic paintings. It was sold at auction in 1888, after which the painting was displayed in the bar of the Hoffman House Hotel, New York City until 1901, when it was bought and stored in a warehouse, the buyer hoping to keep its 'offensive' content from the public.

It depicts not the actual birth of Venus from the sea, but her transportation in a shell as a fully mature woman from the sea to Paphos in Cyprus. She is considered the epitome of the Classical Greek and Roman ideal of the female form and beauty, on par with Venus de Milo.\r For Bouguereau, it is considered a tour de force. The canvas stands at just over 9\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (3.00\u00a0m) high, and 7\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in (2.18\u00a0m) wide. The subject matter, as well as the composition, resembles a previous rendition of this subject, Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus, as well as Raphael's The Triumph of Galatea.\r The Birth of Venus was created for the Paris Salon of 1879. It was awarded the Grand Prix de Rome, and was purchased by the state for the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg. The painting is now in the permanent collection of the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris.\r At the center of the painting, Venus stands nude on a scallop shell being pulled by a dolphin, one of her symbols. Fifteen putti, including Cupid and Psyche, and several nymphs and centaurs have gathered to witness Venus' arrival. Most of the figures are gazing at her, and two of the centaurs are blowing into conch and Triton shells, signaling her arrival.\r Venus is considered to be the embodiment of feminine beauty and form, and these traits are shown in the painting. Her head is tilted to one side, and her facial expression reflects that she is calm and comfortable with her nudity. She raises her arms, arranging her thigh-length, brown hair, swaying elegantly in an \"S\" curve contrapposto, emphasizing the curves of her body.\r The model for Venus was Marie Georgine, princess of Ligne. In 1861, she was on a short holiday in Paris with her lover. Together, they modeled for Bouguereau's \"Abduction of Psyche\" and \"Flora and Zephyr\". He worked out Venus and other sketches and paintings later from photographs he took of the couple. Some of Bouguereau's other works, like La Nuit, are also based on her. Marie was also painted by L\u00e9on Bonnat and photographed by Antoine Samuel Adam-Salomon.\r Venus' figure was enlarged from a nymph from Bouguereau's The Nymphaeum, completed in 1878, a year earlier. The nymph is slightly thinner, and her breasts are fuller and more rounded. Venus' contrapposto is more intense, and her hair is also longer and lighter than the nymph's, but she arranges it almost identically.\r To the upper-left of the painting, there is a shadow in the clouds.

Painted over several summers, it depicts a nude girl or young woman standing in the shallow water of a lake, prominently lit by the morning sun. She is leaning slightly forward in an ambiguous posture, which has been read variously as a straightforward portrayal of protecting her modesty, huddling against the cold, or sponge bathing. It has also been considered a disingenuous pose permitting the \"fetishisation of innocence\".\r September Morn was first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1912, and although the identity of its first owner is unclear, it is certain that Leon Mantashev acquired the painting by the end of 1913. It was taken to Russia, and in the aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917 was feared lost. It resurfaced in 1935 in the collection of Calouste Gulbenkian, and after his death in 1955 was sold to a Philadelphia broker, who donated it anonymously to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met) in 1957. As of 2014 it is not on display.\r From 1913 on, reproductions of the painting caused controversy in the United States. An art dealer in Chicago was charged with indecency and another in New York was targeted by anti-vice crusader Anthony Comstock, both after displaying September Morn. Over the next few years the work was reproduced in a variety of forms, including on pins and calendars, while censorship and art were debated in newspapers. Chabas' painting inspired songs, stage shows and films; eventually some 7\u00a0million reproductions were sold, though Chabas\u00a0\u2013 who had not copyrighted September Morn\u00a0\u2013 did not receive any royalties.\r Although several women claimed to be the model for September Morn, Chabas never revealed her identity. He described the work as \"all I know of painting\", and responded positively to statements that it was his masterpiece. Later writers, however, have described the painting as kitsch, valuable only as a historic artifact.\r September Morn depicts, from an oblique point of view, a naked blonde girl or young woman standing ankle-deep in the water near the shoreline of a tranquil lake surrounded by hills. The figure is backlit by the morning sun, but fully visible, if a little darker than her surroundings. Her arms are folded about her body, her right arm passing below her breasts as she grasps her left elbow, while her left arm conceals her pubic area. This pose has been variously interpreted as the subject protecting herself from the cold, covering her modesty, or sponge bathing, or as the artist's \"fetishisation of innocence\".\r Reviews in 1912 noted that the painting was dominated by grays: those of her shaded body, the blue-grays of the September water, the green-grays of the sky, and the pink-grays of the hills behind her. The art critic Fran\u00e7ois Thi\u00e9bault-Sisson described this as evoking the morning, the young subject preparing to bathe while \"light grey vapours are still floating over the lake\". This oil painting on canvas measures 163.8 by 216.5 centimetres (64.5 by 85.2\u00a0in), and Chabas's signature is located in the lower left.\n", "\nArtist: John Singer Sargent\nArtwork Name: The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/the-daughters-of-edward-darley-boit-1882\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Daughters of Edward Darley Boit (originally titled Portraits d'enfants) is a painting by John Singer Sargent. The painting depicts four young girls, the daughters of Edward Darley Boit, in their family's Paris apartment. It was painted in 1882 and is now exhibited in the new Art of the Americas Wing of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The painting hangs between the two tall blue-and-white Japanese vases depicted in the work; they were donated by the heirs of the Boit family.\r It has been described as \"Arguably the most psychologically compelling painting of Sargent's career\". Though the painting's unusual composition was noted from its earliest viewings, initially its subject was interpreted simply as that of girls at play, but it has subsequently been viewed in more abstract terms, reflecting Freudian analysis and a greater interest in the ambiguities of adolescence.\r Edward Boit was the son-in-law of John Perkins Cushing and a friend of Sargent's. Boit was an \"American cosmopolite\" and a minor painter. His wife and the mother of his five children was Mary Louisa Cushing, known as \"Isa\". Their four daughters were Florence, Jane, Mary Louisa and Julia.\r It is not certain whether The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit was commissioned by Boit or painted at Sargent's suggestion. Set in what is thought to be the foyer of Boit's Paris apartment, its dark interior space is reminiscent of those Sargent had recently painted in Venice. The composition was unusual for a group portrait, both for the varying degrees of prominence given to the figures\u2014conventional group portraiture called for an arrangement in which the subjects were portrayed as equally important\u2014and for the square shape of the canvas.\r The dimensions may owe something to the influence of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez's Las Meninas, which Sargent had copied, and which presages the geometric format and broad, deep spaces of Sargent's painting. When the painting was first exhibited, contemporary critics, including Henry James, wrote of Sargent's debt to Vel\u00e1zquez.\r Art historian Barbara Gallati notes that the English translation of Las Meninas, \"Maids-in-Waiting\", is an apt description for the activity of the Boit children. Carolus-Duran, Sargent's teacher, had encouraged his students to study the work of Vel\u00e1zquez. The relationship between the works is considered so significant that the Museum of Fine Arts (Boston) loaned The Daughters to the Museo del Prado in 2010, so that the paintings could be exhibited together for the first time.\r The brushwork of several passages has been seen as deriving from Frans Hals, and nearly contemporaneous works that have been cited for their similarities are Madame Georges Charpentier and Her Children by Pierre-Auguste Renoir and, especially for its psychological complexity, The Bellelli Family by Edgar Degas.\r Dressed in white pinafores, the children are arranged so that the youngest, four-year-old Julia, sits on the floor, eight-year-old Mary Louisa stands at left, and the two oldest, Jane, aged twelve, and Florence, fourteen, stand in the background, partially obscured by shadow.\r In very nearly hiding one of the girl's faces and subjugating the characterization of individuals to more formal compositional considerations, The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit is as much about the subject of childhood as it is an example of portraiture.\n", "\nArtist: John Singer Sargent\nArtwork Name: El Jaleo\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/el-jaleo-1882\n\nWikipedia Article:\nEl Jaleo is a large painting by John Singer Sargent, depicting a Spanish Gypsy dancer performing to the accompaniment of musicians. Painted in 1882, it currently hangs in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.\r The painting was inspired by a five-month trip Sargent made through Spain and North Africa in 1879, which also yielded a smaller oil painting, The Spanish Dance (Hispanic Society of America). Chronologically and thematically, the painting is related to a series of works Sargent painted during a subsequent stay in Venice; these, too, include dramatic light effects, exotic models, and restrained coloring. Impressed by the costumes and theatrical manner of Gypsy dance, the artist returned to Paris and began work on a large canvas whose scale suggested a performing stage. The name El Jaleo refers to both the broad meaning of jaleo, a ruckus, as well as the specific dance known as jaleo de jerez.\r Sargent planned the composition of El Jaleo for at least a year. The painting was preceded by a series of preliminary studies, focusing particularly on the dancer's stylized posture. The result of thorough preparation, El Jaleo is characterized by an assured and rapid handling, and may have been completed in no more than a few days.\r Almost 12 feet wide, El Jaleo is broadly painted in a nearly monochromatic palette, but for spots of red at the right and an orange at left, which is reminiscent of the lemons \u00c9douard Manet inserted into several of his large paintings. At odds with the academic practice of carefully modulated tones, Sargent dramatized the contrast between rich blacks and the shining white skirt of the dancer, caught in the strong footlights and painted briskly so as to suggest movement. The lighting also creates long and eerie shadows on the rear wall that comprises nearly half the painting.\r The dancer, leaning asymmetrically, is placed to imply forward motion, from left to right across the canvas. The dancer is wearing a large, embroidered shawl wrapped around her shoulders, illustrating common flamenco costuming. The dancer's pose, with the outstretched left arm, is a depiction of standard flamenco dance technique and style.\r El Jaleo is the most theatrical of Sargent's early major works. The lack of a barrier between the viewer and dancer helps create the illusion that we are present at the actual event; the manipulation of space and lighting communicates the energetic rhythms of the dance, its sound and movement.\r El Jaleo is an example of Hispanism, the phenomenon of widespread fascination with Spanish culture throughout Europe and America in the nineteenth and early twentieth century.\r The painting has been called both an example of John Singer Sargent's Impressionism and also his early affinity with the Realist movement.\r Sargent exhibited El Jaleo at the 1882 Paris Salon, where the painting was purchased by a Boston patron, Thomas Jefferson Coolidge. It was the last subject picture that Sargent exhibited at the Salon, and his greatest success there.\r In 1888 the painting was publicly exhibited in Boston, at which time museum patron Isabella Stewart Gardner, the heiress wife of a Coolidge cousin, expressed her interest in it. In 1914 she borrowed El Jaleo to exhibit in her museum, and constructed the Spanish Cloister gallery especially for El Jaleo, which is framed by a Moorish arch. Coolidge then gave the painting to Gardner, and Sargent presented her with an album of pencil drawings he had made as preparatory sketches for the work.\n", "\nArtist: John Singer Sargent\nArtwork Name: Street in Venice\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/street-in-venice-1882\n\nWikipedia Article:\nStreet in Venice (or A Street Scene in Venice) is a c. 1882 oil on wood painting by the American artist John Singer Sargent (1856\u20131925). Painted in a post-impressionist manner, it is set in a quiet backstreet off the Calle Larga dei Proverbi, near the Grand Canal in Venice. The painting shows a young woman walking along the flagstones, kicking her skirt with her right foot, and observed by two men in the shadows to her right. From the manner in which Sargent depicts her down-turned eyes and seemingly fast pace with which she passes the two men, he is concerned largely with the invasive male glare and its effect on the passing woman.\r The painting is one of a number of Venetian scenes painted or drawn by Sargent, who spent most of his life in Europe, during his time in the city. As in his other works, it largely ignores the architectural aspects the city is best known for and focuses instead on edgy back-street imagery. The influence of Impressionism is evident in a number of this work's features, especially in the broad brush strokes of her dress and the unusual cropping of the composition.\r The woman is observed by two intimidating, darkly coloured men huddled in conversation to the right of the frame. In the middle background a couple are seated outside of a cafe or bar, also deep in conversation. The couple are interested only in themselves, in contrast to the two men. Their gaze follows the girl, while her downcast eyes deliberately avoid their attention. Her shawl and skirt hem are shown flowing, suggesting that she is moving quickly past them. The Venice setting is significant; the artist has placed the moment away from the cosmopolitan surroundings of London, Paris or New York\u00a0\u2013 cities more familiar to him and which he considered more refined.\r In composition and mood, the painting has been linked by the writer Margaret Conrads to the earlier Crossing the Street by Giovanni Boldini, who lived in Venice during 1880. Similar to Sargent's other Venetian scenes, the street is mostly darkened, the peripheral figures in shadow, while light spills on the buildings from the distance.\r In its use of broad dark areas silhouetted against lighter ground used to give shape to the figures, it seems influenced by Vel\u00e1zquez. That Sargent was influenced by photography of Venice, in particular by the works of Carlo Naya (1816\u20131882), can be seen the way the painting is closely cropped, and in the almost photographic freeze-frame capturing of movement in a moment in time.\r The painting is composed as a series of descending rectangles arranged in a near-telescopic manner, outside of which a section of blue sky lightens the claustrophobic tone marked by the descending angles which meet at the girl's head. It is largely rendered in monochrome, though there are touches of red in the girl's head comb, dress and in the cafe behind her. However, overall the artist is more concerned with tone than colour.\r Street in Venice was first exhibited in 1882 at the Galerie Georges Petit in Paris. It was purchased by Elizabeth Chanler of Boston in 1888, who gave it to the American architect Stanford White in return for professional services. In 1962, the painting was acquired by the National Gallery of Art, Washington, where it is on permanent display.\n", "\nArtist: John Singer Sargent\nArtwork Name: The Misses Vickers\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/the-misses-vickers-1884\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Misses Vickers is an oil painting by John Singer Sargent. The painting depicts three young ladies, from the Vickers family, in their estate in Bolsover Hill, Sheffield.\r The Times of May 22, 1886 reviewed the painting thus: \"Three young ladies, painted in a thin and almost ghostly fashion, gaze straight out of the picture at you. They seem as insubstantial as beings from another world; these faces, medicated rather than painted, these cloudy dresses, these unsubstantial chairs and tables, are they portraits or are they mere suggestions for portraits? Seeing the picture for the first time... one inevitably answers that they are mere sketches; that the artist no doubt intends to carry his work much further. But a second and a third examination bring one to a different mind, and almost, if not quite, convince one that this art, at once very bold and very subtle, is legitimate; that the painter has really got in this apparent slighting the truth about his sitters, and that no further touches could put more life or more character into face or form or accessories.\"\r The Misses Vickers by John Singer Sargent - Yorkshire's Favourite Paintings\n", "\nArtist: John Singer Sargent\nArtwork Name: Reapers Resting in a Wheat Field\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/reapers-resting-in-a-wheat-field-1885\n\nWikipedia Article:\nReapers Resting in a Wheat Field is a late 19th-century painting by American impressionist John Singer Sargent. Done in oil on canvas, the painting a scene set in a wheat field near the village of Broadway, Worcestershire.  The painting depicts a group of English wheat farmers resting in their field during harvest. The titular reapers are seated in a semicircle, with their sickles stuck in the ground. As is evident by the stacks of wheat in the field, the harvest is well underway. The sky in the background is slightly overcast, while a brace of trees provides a stark, green backdrop that contrasts the yellow field of wheat. Aspects of the painting consist of long, wavy brushstrokes, a style in tune with Sagent's impressionist proclivities.

The painting is dominated by green foliage, with no horizon or other horizontal line to give a sense of depth. The viewer seems to be on a level with the children but also looking down on them. The two subjects of the painting are the daughters of the illustrator Frederick Barnard \u2013 a friend of Sargent's. Dolly, left, was 11 years-old and Polly, right, 7 years-old; they were chosen for their blonde hair, replacing Sargent's original model, Francis Davis Millet's 5-year-old daughter, dark-haired Katherine. The title comes from the refrain of a popular song \"Ye Shepherds Tell Me\" by Joseph Mazzinghi, a pastoral glee for a trio of male voices, which mentions Flora wearing \"A wreath around her head, around her head she wore, Carnation, lily, lily, rose\".\r The work is set in an English garden at Farnham House in Broadway in the Cotswolds, where Sargent spent the summer of 1885 with Millet shortly after moving to England from Paris to escape the scandal caused by his 1884 painting Portrait of Madame X. Sargent took inspiration from the lanterns that he saw hanging among trees and lilies while boating on the River Thames at Pangbourne with American artist Edwin Austin Abbey in September 1885. Sargent wanted to capture the exact level of light at dusk so he painted the picture en plein air \u2013 outdoors and in the Impressionist manner. Every day from September to November 1885, he painted in the few minutes when the light was perfect, giving the picture an overall purple tint of evening. The flowers in the garden died as summer turned to autumn, and they were replaced with artificial flowers. Sargent resumed painting the following summer at Millet's new home nearby in Broadway and finally finished the painting by the end of October 1886. In the course of working, Sargent cut down the rectangular canvas, removing approximately 2 feet (61\u00a0cm) from the left side, to leave an approximately square shape.\r The work received a mixed reception at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1887, with some criticising his \"Frenchified\" style. However, there was also much praise, and Sir Frederic Leighton, President of the Royal Academy, encouraged the Tate Gallery to buy the painting later that year, using money from the Chantrey Bequest. It was the first of Sargent's works to be acquired by a public museum. The painting remains part of the Tate collection and is displayed at Tate Britain.\n", "\nArtist: John Singer Sargent\nArtwork Name: Gassed\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/gassed-1918\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGassed is a very large oil painting completed in March 1919 by John Singer Sargent. It depicts the aftermath of a mustard gas attack during the First World War, with a line of wounded soldiers walking towards a dressing station. Sargent was commissioned by the British War Memorials Committee to document the war and visited the Western Front in July 1918 spending time with the Guards Division near Arras, and then with the American Expeditionary Forces near Ypres. The painting was finished in March 1919 and voted picture of the year by the Royal Academy of Arts in 1919. It is now held by the Imperial War Museum. However, it is currently on display from February to June, in the National World War One Museum in Kansas City, Missouri.\r The painting measures 231.0 by 611.1 centimetres (7\u00a0ft 6.9\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a020\u00a0ft 0.6\u00a0in). The composition includes a central group of eleven soldiers depicted nearly life-size. Nine wounded soldiers walk in a line, in three groups of three, along a duckboard towards a dressing station, suggested by the guy ropes to the right side of the picture. Their eyes are bandaged, blinded by the effect of the gas, so they are assisted by two medical orderlies. The line of tall, blond soldiers forms a naturalist allegorical frieze, with connotations of a religious procession. Many other dead or wounded soldiers lie around the central group, and a similar train of eight wounded, with two orderlies, advances in the background. Biplanes dogfight in the evening sky above, as a watery setting sun creates a pinkish yellow haze and burnishes the subjects with a golden light. In the background, the moon also rises, and uninjured men play football in blue and red shirts, seemingly unconcerned at the suffering all around them.\r In May 1918, Sargent was one of several painters commissioned by the British War Memorials Committee of the British Ministry of Information to create a large painting for a planned Hall of Remembrance. The plan was a complement to the artworks commissioned by the Canadian War Memorials Fund since 1916 at the instigation of Lord Beaverbrook who, by 1918, was serving as the British Minister of Information. Other works were commissioned from Percy Wyndham Lewis, Paul Nash, Henry Lamb, John Nash and Stanley Spencer. The large scale of the works was inspired by Uccello's triptych The Battle of San Romano. The plan for a Hall of Remembrance decorated by large paintings was abandoned when the project was incorporated with that for Imperial War Museum.\r As an American painter, Sargent was asked to create a work embodying Anglo-American co-operation. Although he was 62 years old, he travelled to the Western Front in July 1918, accompanied by Henry Tonks. He spent time with the Guards Division near Arras, and then with the American Expeditionary Forces near Ypres. He was determined to paint an epic work with many human figures, but struggled to find a situation with American and British figures in the same scene.

It was commissioned by South African financier Sir Abraham Bailey, 1st Baronet to commemorate the generals who commanded British and British Empire armies in the First World War.\r Sargent was initially unwilling to take on such a large project, but took the commission in January 1919 and began work in August 1920, after he completed his similarly huge painting, Gassed. He was also working on murals for the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts.\r Sargent found it difficult to find a suitable composition for so many full-length portraits, and Sargent himself foresaw a \"horrible failure\". The resulting painting is unsatisfactory, with 22 men in khaki uniforms standing like pillars in a crowd in front of an anonymous brownish void, possibly an open doorway, with the bases of fluted pillars to either side. Sargent described it as \"painting them all standing up in a vacuum\". They look forward with blank stares, with no discernible purpose, almost as if each was unaware of the others around him.\r The completed painting measures 118\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0208 inches (3.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05.3\u00a0m). It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1922.\r Bailey commissioned two other commemorative portraits, Statesmen of World War I by Sir James Guthrie, and Naval Officers of World War I by Sir Arthur Stockdale Cope. Bailey paid \u00a35,000 for each of the three paintings and donated all three to the National Portrait Gallery.\r The painting depicts 22 of the approximately 1,500 brigadier-generals, major-generals, lieutenant-generals, generals, and field marshals who served in the British and Imperial armies in the First World War.

Some were deliberately omitted (for example, General Ian Hamilton was blamed for the failure at Gallipoli and left out). Others prominent army commanders to be left out include Horace Smith-Dorrien, Hubert Gough, Charles Monro, Richard Haking, William Peyton, Charles Kavanagh, John Nixon, Percy Lake, and Charles Townshend; administrative officers such as Stanley Brenton von Donop, William Furse, Nevil Macready, George Macdonogh, Ronald Charles Maxwell and Travers Clarke, several Chiefs of the Imperial General Staff - Charles W. H. Douglas, James Wolfe Murray, and Archibald Murray - and army chiefs of staff, such as Tim Harington, Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd, Launcelot Kiggell and Herbert Lawrence.

The Impressionist work depicts Fifth Avenue in New York City in the rain, festooned with US flags. The painting is one of six works by Hassam in the permanent art collection of the White House in Washington DC.\r Between 1916 and 1919, Childe Hassam painted around 30 paintings of streets decorated with flags. This work was painted in February 1917, shortly before the US joined the First World War, at a time when patriotic fervour was rising in the US. The previous month, Germany extended its unrestricted submarine warfare to neutral ships, including vessels bearing the US flag. The Zimmermann Telegram became public knowledge at the end of February 1917, and the US declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917.\r The painting measures 42 by 22.25 inches (106.7\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a056.5\u00a0cm). It has dominant tones of red and blue, with whites for the stars and stripes; several dark figures in the middle distance are holding umbrellas, and those further away fade into the blue background. The flags seem to float in mid-air, flying from flagpoles that project out from the buildings on the street, but the buildings are not visible. The flags and human figures are reflected on the wet street and sidewalk. Childe Hassam may have been influenced by two similar works of Claude Monet depicting national celebrations in Paris on 30 June 1878.\r It was donated to the White House in 1963 by Thomas Mellon Evans. It was hung between the windows in John F. Kennedy's blue-themed President's Bedroom (now a private sitting room, adjacent to the Yellow Oval Room on the second floor of the White House), and then was in the President's Dining Room for many years.

The main combatants were the four divisions of the Canadian Corps in the First Army, against three divisions of the German 6th Army. The battle, which took place from 9 to 12 April 1917, was part of the opening phase of the Battle of Arras, the first attack of the Nivelle Offensive, intended to attract German reserves from the French front.\r The objective of the Canadian Corps was to take control of the German-held high ground along an escarpment at the northernmost end of the Arras Offensive. This would ensure that the southern flank could advance without suffering German enfilade fire. Supported by a creeping barrage, the Canadian Corps captured most of the ridge during the first day of the attack. The village of Th\u00e9lus fell during the second day of the attack, as did the crest of the ridge, once the Canadian Corps overcame a salient against considerable German resistance. The final objective, a fortified knoll located outside the village of Givenchy-en-Gohelle, fell to the Canadian Corps on 12 April. The German forces then retreated to the Oppy\u2013M\u00e9ricourt line.\r Historians attribute the success of the Canadian Corps in capturing the ridge to a mixture of technical and tactical innovation, meticulous planning, powerful artillery support and extensive training, as well as the failure of the German 6th Army properly to apply the new German defensive doctrine. The battle was the first occasion when all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle together and it was made a symbol of Canadian national achievement and sacrifice. A 100-hectare (250-acre) portion of the former battleground serves as a memorial park and site of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial.\r Vimy Ridge is an escarpment 8\u00a0km (5.0\u00a0mi) northeast of Arras on the western edge of the Douai Plain. The ridge rises gradually on its western side and drops more quickly on the eastern side. At approximately 7\u00a0km (4.3\u00a0mi) in length and culminating at an elevation of 145\u00a0m (476\u00a0ft) or 60\u00a0m (200\u00a0ft) above the Douai Plains, the ridge provides a natural unobstructed view for tens of kilometres in all directions.\r The ridge fell under German control in October 1914 during the Race to the Sea as the Franco-British and German forces continually attempted to outflank each other through northeastern France. The French Tenth Army attempted to dislodge the Germans from the region during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915 by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and Notre Dame de Lorette. The French 1st Moroccan Division managed to briefly capture the height of the ridge but was unable to hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements. The French made another attempt during the Third Battle of Artois in September 1915 but only captured the village of Souchez at the western base of the ridge. The Vimy sector calmed following the offensive with both sides taking a largely live and let live approach. In all, the French suffered approximately 150,000 casualties in their attempts to gain control of Vimy Ridge and surrounding territory.\n", "\nArtist: Henri Matisse\nArtwork Name: Luxury, Calm and Pleasure\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse/luxury-serenity-and-pleasure-1904\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLuxe, Calme et Volupt\u00e9 is an oil painting by the French artist Henri Matisse. Both foundational in the oeuvre of Matisse and a pivotal work in the history of art, Luxe, Calme et Volupt\u00e9 is considered the starting point of Fauvism. This painting is a dynamic and vibrant work created early on in his career as a painter. It displays an evolution of the Neo-Impressionist style mixed with a new conceptual meaning based in fantasy and leisure that had not been seen in works before.   Prior to the beginning of his Fauvist period Matisse had been formally educated in the arts and started his career copying works from old masters. His first original works resembled those from his education. After he left school, influence from Impressionism developed into his work and gradually led him to the Post-Impressionist movement where this style stuck with him until it evolved into Fauvism. Matisse frequently purchased works from artists such as C\u00e9zanne, Van Gogh, and Gauguin during his time before Fauvism that influenced his painting and the development of his style over time.  Luxe, Calme et Volupt\u00e9 was painted by Matisse in 1904, after a summer spent working in St. Tropez on the French Riviera alongside the Neo-Impressionist painters Paul Signac and Henri-Edmond Cross. Signac purchased the work, which was exhibited in 1905 at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants.   The painting's title comes from the poem L'Invitation au voyage, from Charles Baudelaire's volume Les Fleurs du mal (The Flowers of Evil):  The painting is Matisse's most important work in which he used the Divisionist technique advocated by Signac. Divisionism is created by individual dots of colors placed strategically on the canvas in order to appear blended from a distance; Matisse's variant of this style is created by numerous short dashes of color to develop the forms that are seen in the image. He first adopted the style after reading Signac's essay \"D'Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix au N\u00e9o-impressionisme\" in 1898.  The simplification of form and details is a trademark of Fauvist landscapes in which artists intentionally created artificial structures that distorted the reality of images. Many of these same qualities can be found in Matisse's other works. Other Fauvist painters worked on large scale landscapes that did not focus as much on figures within the composition as with Matisse's works.  Scholars suggest that interpreting the paintings requires the viewer to acknowledge its resistance to interpretation. Matisse's previous works were all firmly rooted in the visual aspects of Post-Impression leading scholars to question how his work had taken such a drastic turn into a depiction of fantasy. David Carrier writes that the painting is ambiguous and lacks reference to any of its supposed sources of inspiration. Despite the literary source for the work's title, Luxe, Calme, et Volupt\u00e9, it is not related to the narrative of poem in any way.\n", "\nArtist: Henri Matisse\nArtwork Name: The Green Line\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse/portrait-of-madame-matisse-green-stripe-1905\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Green Stripe (La Raie Verte), also known as Portrait of Madame Matisse.

It is named for the green band that divides the face in half, by which Matisse sought to produce a sense of light, shadow, and volume without using traditional shading. Matisse's colorism was shocking at the time.

It depicts a number of key figures from the once secret brotherhood of Les Nabis (Hebr. the Prophets). The painting is a retrospective; by 1900 the group was breaking up as its members matured.\r In this painting, Maurice Denis has gathered a group of friends, artists and critics to celebrate Paul C\u00e9zanne, who is represented by his still life Fruit Bowl, Glass and Apples of 1879\u201380 on an easel in the centre of the painting. The scene is the shop of the art dealer Ambroise Vollard in the Rue Laffitte. The C\u00e9zanne painting had belonged to Paul Gauguin who is thus evoked, despite not being pictured, having left France permanently in 1895 for the South Seas. Gauguin described the C\u00e9zanne as \"an exceptional pearl, the apple of my eye.\" Works by Gauguin and Renoir can be seen in the background.\r Pictured are many of the key figures from the secret brotherhood of the Nabis, for whom Gauguin was the principal mentor. Included are the symbolist painter Odilon Redon, the focus of attention on the far left, Paul S\u00e9rusier (Nabi instigator) centre talking to Redon, and at the back, left to right, Edouard Vuillard, the critic Andr\u00e9 Mellerio wearing a top hat, Ambroise Vollard behind the easel, Maurice Denis, Paul Ranson, Ker-Xavier Roussel, Pierre Bonnard with a pipe, and on the far right Marthe Denis, Maurice's wife.\r Redon is the respected elder figure of the group, set somewhat apart from the rest. It can be inferred from S\u00e9rusier's pose that he is explaining to Redon why the Nabis admire C\u00e9zanne. Over time, Redon had come to be more closely associated with C\u00e9zanne than with Symbolist fellow traveller Gustave Moreau. Redon's inclusion in the picture is not surprising; Denis was a fan of Redon and once remarked \"the lesson of Redon is his powerlessness to paint anything which is not representative of a state of soul, which does not express some depth of emotion, which does not translate an interior vision.\"\r At 180 cm high x 240 cm wide the painting is almost life size, which serves to increase its visual impact. The composition has strong verticals in the erect poses of the subjects, the easel and the walking stick, against which the brightly coloured rectangle of the framed still life is contrasted. The scene is crowded. Vollard is grasping the easel which is bursting out of the top edge of the painting, and the figures fully occupy the space of the canvas, leaving little room for anything else. Mrs Denis is reduced to peering over Bonnard's shoulder. Contrasting the strong verticals, the heads of the group provide a horizontal rhythm to the work. The conservative black suits belie the avant-garde reputation of the Nabis.\r Belinda Thomson described Homage to C\u00e9zanne as Denis \"turning away from the more spectacular, subjective Symbolism of Gauguin and van Gogh towards what he saw as the reassertion of classical values in C\u00e9zanne.\" Denis had visited Rome with Gide in 1898 where he had discovered a renewed interest in classicism. He subsequently published articles such as \"C\u00e9zanne\" in 1907 and \"De Gauguin et de Van Gogh au classicisme\" in 1909 which argued that classicism was at the core of French cultural tradition. By doing so, he influenced a new generation of French artists.\n", "\nArtist: Leon Kroll\nArtwork Name: Summer Days, Camden Maine, the Bellows Family\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/leon-kroll/summer-days-camden-maine-the-bellows-family-1916\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGeorge Wesley Bellows (August 12 or August 19, 1882 \u2013 January 8, 1925) was an American realist painter, known for his bold depictions of urban life in New York City, becoming, according to the Columbus Museum of Art, \"the most acclaimed American artist of his generation\".\r George Wesley Bellows was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. He was the only child of George Bellows and Anna Wilhelmina Smith Bellows (he had a half-sister, Laura, 18 years his senior). He was born four years after his parents married, at the ages of fifty (George) and forty (Anna). His mother was the daughter of a whaling captain based in Sag Harbor, Long Island, and his family returned there for their summer vacations. He began drawing well before kindergarten, and his elementary\u2013school teachers often asked him to decorate their classroom blackboards at Thanksgiving and Christmas.\r At age 10 George decided to become an athlete, and trained himself to become a popular baseball and basketball player. He became good enough at both sports to play semipro ball for years afterward. During his senior year, a baseball scout from the Indianapolis team made him an offer. He declined, opting to enroll at The Ohio State University (1901\u20131904). There he played for the baseball and basketball teams, and provided illustrations for the Makio, the school's student yearbook. He was encouraged to become a professional baseball player, and he worked as a commercial illustrator while a student and continued to accept magazine assignments throughout his life. Despite these opportunities in athletics and commercial art, Bellows desired success as a painter. He left Ohio State in 1904 just before he was to graduate and moved to New York City to study art.\r Bellows was soon a student of Robert Henri, before the later-famous artist had set up his own famous school, who at the time was teaching at the New York School of Art. While studying there, Bellows became associated with Henri's \"The Eight\" and the Ashcan School, a group of artists who advocated painting contemporary American society in all its forms. By 1906, Bellows and fellow art student Edward Keefe had set up a studio at 1947 Broadway Street.\r Bellows first achieved widespread notice in 1908, when he and other pupils of Henri organized an exhibition of mostly urban studies. While many critics considered these to be crudely painted, others found them welcomely audacious, a step beyond the work of his teacher. Bellows taught at the Art Students League of New York in 1909, although he was more interested in pursuing a career as a painter. His fame grew as he contributed to other nationally recognized juried shows.\r Bellows' urban New York scenes depicted the crudity and chaos of working-class people and neighborhoods, and satirized the upper classes. From 1907 through 1915, he executed a series of paintings depicting New York City under snowfall. In these paintings Bellows developed his strong sense of light and visual texture, exhibiting a stark contrast between the blue and white expanses of snow and the rough and grimy surfaces of city structures, and creating an aesthetically ironic image of the equally rough and grimy men struggling to clear away the nuisance of the pure snow. However, Bellows' series of paintings portraying amateur boxing matches were arguably his signature contribution to art history. They are characterized by dark atmospheres, through which the bright, roughly lain brushstrokes of the human figures vividly strike with a strong sense of motion and direction.\n", "\nArtist: Marcel Duchamp\nArtwork Name: Nude Descending a Staircase, No.2\nArtwork Genre: figurative\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/marcel-duchamp/nude-descending-a-staircase-no-2-1912\n\nWikipedia Article:\nNude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 (French: Nu descendant un escalier n\u00b0 2) is a 1912 painting by Marcel Duchamp. The work is widely regarded as a Modernist classic and has become one of the most famous of its time. Before its first presentation at the Parisian 1912 Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, it was rejected by the Cubists as too Futurist. Yet the work was exhibited with the same group at Galeries J. Dalmau, Exposici\u00f3 d'Art Cubista, in Barcelona, 20 April\u201310 May 1912, and subsequently caused a huge stir during its exhibition at the 1913 Armory Show in New York. The painting was reproduced in Les Peintres Cubistes, M\u00e9ditations Esth\u00e9tiques by Guillaume Apollinaire, published in 1913. Nude Descending a Staircase is in the Louise and Walter Arensberg Collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\r The work, an oil painting on canvas with dimensions of 147\u00a0cm \u00d7 89.2\u00a0cm (57.9\u00a0in \u00d7 35.1\u00a0in) in portrait, seemingly depicts a figure demonstrating an abstract movement in its ochres and browns. The discernible \"body parts\" of the figure are composed of nested, conical and cylindrical abstract elements, assembled together in such a way as to suggest rhythm and convey the movement of the figure merging into itself. Dark outlines limit the contours of the body while serving as motion lines that emphasize the dynamics of the moving figure, while the accented arcs of the dotted lines seem to suggest a thrusting pelvic motion. The movement seems to be rotated counterclockwise from the upper left to the lower right corner, where the gradient of the apparently frozen sequence corresponding to the bottom right to top left dark, respectively, becomes more transparent, the fading of which is apparently intended to simulate the \"older\" section. At the edges of the picture, the steps are indicated in darker colors. The center of the image is an amalgam of light and dark, that becomes more piqued approaching the edges. The overall warm, monochrome bright palette ranges from yellow ochre to dark, almost black tones. The colors are translucent. At the bottom left Duchamp placed the title \"NU DESCENDANT UN ESCALIER\" in block letters, which may or may not be related to the work. The question of whether the figure represents a human body remains unanswered; the figure provides no clues to its age, individuality, or character, while the gender of \"nu\" is male.\r The painting combines elements of both the Cubist and Futurist movements. In the composition, Duchamp depicts motion by successive superimposed images, similar to stroboscopic motion photography. Duchamp also recognized the influence of the stop-motion photography of \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey, particularly Muybridge's Woman Walking Downstairs from his 1887 picture series, published as The Human Figure in Motion.\r Duchamp submitted the work to appear with the Cubists at the 28th exhibition of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Ind\u00e9pendants, Paris, 25 March through 16 May 1912. It appeared under the number 1001 of the catalogue, entitled simply Nu descendant l'escalier, not Nu descendant un escalier n\u00b0 2. This catalogue revealed the title of the painting to the general public for the first time, even though the painting itself would be absent from the exhibition. It has been noted disquisitively that the number 1001 of Duchamp's entry at the 1912 Ind\u00e9pendants catalogue also happens to represent in the form 10.01 the integer 2 in the Golden ratio base, related to the golden section, something of much interest to the Duchamps and others of the Puteaux Group. This, of course, was by chance\u2014and it is not known whether Duchamp was familiar enough with the mathematics of the golden ratio to have made such a connection\u2014as it was by chance too the relation to Arabic Manuscript of One Thousand and One Nights dating back to the 14th century.\n", "\nArtist: Grant Wood\nArtwork Name: American Gothic\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: board,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/grant-wood/american-gothic-1930\n\nWikipedia Article:\nAmerican Gothic is a painting by Grant Wood in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. Wood's inspiration came in his decision to paint what is known as the American Gothic House along with \"the kind of people I fancied should live in that house.\" He painted it in 1930, depicting a farmer standing beside a woman who has been interpreted to be his daughter or his wife. The figures were modeled by Wood's sister Nan Wood Graham and their dentist Dr. Byron McKeeby. The woman is dressed in a colonial print apron evoking 19th-century Americana, and the man is holding a pitchfork. The plants on the porch of the house are mother-in-law's tongue and beefsteak begonia, which are the same as the plants in Wood's 1929 portrait of his mother Woman with Plants.\r It is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century American art and has been widely parodied in American popular culture. The painting was displayed in Paris at the Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie in its first showing outside the United States on October 15, 2016 \u2013 January 30, 2017, and in London at the Royal Academy of Arts February 25 \u2013 June 4, 2017.\r In August 1930, Grant Wood, an American painter with European training, was driven around Eldon, Iowa, by a young painter from Eldon, John Sharp. Looking for inspiration, Wood noticed the Dibble House, a small white house built in the Carpenter Gothic architectural style. Sharp's brother suggested in 1973 that it was on this drive that Wood first sketched the house on the back of an envelope. Wood's earliest biographer, Darrell Garwood, noted that Wood \"thought it a form of borrowed pretentiousness, a structural absurdity, to put a Gothic-style window in such a flimsy frame house.\" At the time, Wood classified it as one of the \"cardboardy frame houses on Iowa farms\" and considered it \"very paintable\". After obtaining permission from the Jones family, the house's owners, Wood made a sketch the next day in oil on paperboard from the house's front yard. This sketch displayed a steeper roof and a longer window with a more pronounced ogive than on the actual house, features which eventually adorned the final work.\r Wood decided to paint the house along with \"the kind of people I fancied should live in that house.\" He recruited his sister Nan (1899\u20131990) to model the woman, dressing her in a colonial print apron mimicking 19th-century Americana. The man is modeled on Wood's dentist, Dr. Byron McKeeby (1867\u20131950) from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Nan, perhaps embarrassed about being depicted as the wife of a man twice her age, told people that her brother had envisioned the couple as father and daughter, rather than husband and wife, which Wood seems to confirm in his letter to a Mrs. Nellie Sudduth in 1941.\r Elements of the painting stress the vertical that is associated with Gothic architecture. The three-pronged pitchfork is echoed in the stitching of the man's overalls, the Gothic window of the house, and the structure of the man's face. However, Wood did not add figures to his sketch until he returned to his studio in Cedar Rapids. He would not return to Eldon again before his death in 1942, although he did request a photograph of the home to complete his painting.\n", "\nArtist: Jean-Honore Fragonard\nArtwork Name: The\u00a0Birth\u00a0of\u00a0Venus\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-honore-fragonard/the-birth-of-venus-1755\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Birth of Venus is an oil on canvas painting by Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, produced between 1753 and 1755 and now in the Mus\u00e9e Grobet-Labadi\u00e9 in Marseille.\n", "\nArtist: Jean-Honore Fragonard\nArtwork Name: The Swing\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-honore-fragonard/the-swing-1767\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Swing (French: L'Escarpolette), also known as The Happy Accidents of the Swing (French: Les Hasards heureux de l'escarpolette, the original title), is an 18th-century oil painting by Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard in the Wallace Collection in London. It is considered to be one of the masterpieces of the rococo era, and is Fragonard's best known work.\r The painting depicts an elegant young woman on a swing. A smiling young man, hiding in the bushes on the left, watches her from a vantage point that allows him to see up into her billowing dress, where his arm is pointed with hat in hand. A smiling older man, who is nearly hidden in the shadows on the right, propels the swing with a pair of ropes. The older man appears to be unaware of the young man. As the young lady swings high, she throws her left leg up, allowing her dainty shoe to fly through the air. The lady is wearing a berg\u00e8re hat (shepherdess hat). Cupid watches the affair at the side of the painting, while putting his finger to his lips. There are also two cherubs below the swing. One of them look away in disapproval while the other look at them in dread. According to the memoirs of the dramatist Charles Coll\u00e9, a courtier (homme de la cour) asked first Gabriel Fran\u00e7ois Doyen to make this painting of him and his mistress. Not comfortable with this frivolous work, Doyen refused and passed on the commission to Fragonard. The man had requested a portrait of his mistress seated on a swing being pushed by a bishop, but Fragonard painted a layman.\r This style of \"frivolous\" painting soon became the target of the philosophers of the Enlightenment, who demanded a more serious art which would show the nobility of man.\r The original owner remains unclear. A firm provenance begins only with the tax farmer M.-F. M\u00e9nage de Pressigny, who died in 1794, after which it was seized by the revolutionary government. It was possibly later owned by the marquis des Razins de Saint-Marc, and certainly by the duc de Morny. After his death in 1865 it was bought at auction in Paris by Lord Hertford, the main founder of the Wallace Collection.\r There are two notable copies, neither by Fragonard.\n", "\nArtist: Jean-Honore Fragonard\nArtwork Name: Blind Man\u2019s Bluff\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-honore-fragonard/blind-man-s-bluff-1770-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBlind Man's Bluff (French: Le collin maillard) is a painting by the French Rococo painter Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, produced around 1769 in oil on canvas. It is full of deceptions \u2013 the girl is looking out from under her blindfold and the game seems to be a pretext leading to seduction; the two figures are in pastoral costume, but may be noble or bourgeois figures playing at being pastoral figures; the background seems to be a wood but could be a stage set. In short, it seems to abolish the boundary between truth and lies, reality and fiction.\r The Toledo Museum of Art describes the work \"Playfully erotic and sensuously painted, Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard's scene of youthful flirtation fulfils the eighteenth-century aristocratic French taste for romantic pastoral themes. The figures are beautifully dressed in rustic but improbably clean and fashionable clothes; the woman's shoes even have elegant bows on them.\"\r The painting was intended to accompany The See-Saw (1750) [1], currently, held by the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, in Madrid. Both are painted in the style and spirit of Fragonard's master Fran\u00e7ois Boucher. Boucher's training can be seen in the ornamental flourishes of flowers and trees. But Fragonard's own skill may be seen in the brilliant composition. Blindman's bluff can be seen as a metaphor for courtship, while the rocking of the see-saw would clearly be a metaphor for the act of lovemaking itself.\r Another painting of the same name was completed by Fragonard, after the artist\u2019s second journey to Italy in 1773\u201374, between about 1775 and 1780. In this more expansive version well-dressed men, women and children play the familiar game in a picturesque overgrown garden. Fragonard\u2019s favorite subject, he may have viewed the games as symbolizing the game of courtship. The painting is held by the Timken Museum of Art, in San Diego, California.\r According to eighteenth-century engravings of the two paintings, both may have originally been as much as a foot higher at the top.

It was purchased by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC in 1961 using funds donated by Ailsa Mellon Bruce, the daughter of Andrew W. Mellon, following her father's death. Alisa Mellon Bruce was a well-known socialite in Manhattan and gained recognition in the art world from the numerous generous donations she gave to a variety of museums and art programs.\r Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard had an extensive career. It began mainly in when Fragonard won the 1753 Prix de Rome with a painting titled Jeroboam Sacrificing to the Golden Calf. Soon after the takeoff of his career, Honor\u00e9 became a prominent name within the Rococo artistic movement, which was filled light colors, asymmetrical designs, and curved, natural forms. The Rococo style emerged in Paris during the eighteenth century, more specifically during the reign of Louis XV. This was due to the fact that during this time, the French upper class experienced a new social and intellectual freedom. As Petra ten-Doesschate Chu stated, \u201cAristocrats and wealthy bourgeois focused on play and pleasure. Grace and wit were prized in social interactions. A new intellectual curiosity gave rise to a healthy skepticism toward well-worn truths.\u201d  Fragonard was most drawn to the playful lives and loves of the aristocratic youth of his day.\r The painting features an unidentified girl wearing a lemon yellow dress with white ruff collar and cuffs and purple ribbons. The subject is depicted in profile, reading from a small book held in her right hand, sitting with her left arm on a wooden rail and her back supported by a large lilac cushion resting against a wall. Her hair is tied in a chignon with a purple ribbon, and her face and dress are lit from the front, casting a shadow in the wall behind her. Fragonard pays close attention to the face, but uses looser brushwork on the dress and cushion, and the ruff was scratched into the paint with the end of a brush. The horizontal line of the armrest and a vertical line between two unadorned walls provide a sense of space and structure.\r The female figure in Young Girl Reading was meant to represent the natural essence of femininity. For starters, the dark wall in the background helps frame and emphasize the subject\u2019s female form. Fragonard pulls the figures hair up in a ribbon and to expose more of her neck, and also places a collar around the bottom of her neck, which both help elongate the female form. Fragonard makes the female subjects face have a rosy-tint to it, which adds a daintier and more delicate feel to the painting.\r When looking closely at the book the female subject is reading in Young Girl Reading, one will notice that there is no legible writing. This lack of writing adds a sense of mystery to the painting and begs the question of, \u201cWhat is she reading and why?\u201d, and could mean she is reading for pleasure, and not for academic purposes.\n", "\nArtist: Jean-Honore Fragonard\nArtwork Name: The Bolt\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-honore-fragonard/the-bolt\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Lock is a gallant scene painted by Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard in 1777. It is one of the most famous paintings by the painter, an authentic example of eighteenth-century painting. The common interpretation suggests that the scene depicts two lovers entwined in a bedroom, the man locking the door. The painting is preserved in the Louvre Museum, in the section of the Department of Paintings devoted to eighteenth-century French painting on the second floor of the Sully wing. It stands together with some of the most famous pictorial masterpieces of the same period, in a chronologically organized path. This painting, a true symbol of the libertine spirit of the 18th century, reflects the state of mind adopted by the painters of the era, notably that of Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, one of Fragonard's teachers and a great representative of rococo painting.\r The work was commissioned in 1773 by Louis-Gabriel V\u00e9ri-Raionard, Marquis de V\u00e9ri (1722\u20131785). Having been produced for such a reputable and demanding collector, this erotic painting, ostensibly light but asserting a real ambition, formed part of a collection of depictions that were amorous, at times coarse and yet eminently representative of the spirit of French society at a time when the Enlightenment movement was about to waver. The canvas seemed to unveil a profound revitalization of Fragonard's inspiration that first distinguished itself in historical paintings, in particular Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols, first prize of Rome 1752. The obtaining of this distinction allowed Fragonard to enjoy a great fame. His scenes of gallantry were extremely popular, and the nobility offered him many commissions, like that of Baron Saint-Julian for The Swing (1767).\r Originally, Fragonard had given The Lock \"a more suitable twin: The Contract,\" itself following on from another called The Armoire. The painting, which belonged to the Marquis of V\u00e9ri's collection, was brought to us thanks to the etching of Maurice Blot, who had, 8 years previously, made an etching of The Lock. This print, considered as mediocre, had great success, however, attributable in large part to the fame of Fragonard. Indeed, a theory claimed that the two works, The Contract and The Lock, constitute, along with another painting of Fragonard, The Armoire, the three chapters of a novel in which the heroes would be the two lovers. The Lock illustrated the passion of the couple, The Armoire, the discovery of their affair and being caught in the act, and The Contract, their reconciliation.\r Today, we consider there being only one twin to The Lock, a work of more sacred inspiration, The Adoration of the Shepherds (1775). This canvas, also commissioned by the marquis, had been suggested by Fragonard himself. It shows the will of Fragonard to revive holy artwork and allow the contrast of two meanings of love: carnal or libertine love, belonging to the 18th century, and sacred, religious love.\r Painting tall lover of the drawing Fragonard started by making several sketches and surveys of The Lock. We suppose that the Master used models for the realization of his work, like he sometimes was used to, as could illustrate his canvas The Model's First Sitting. He also liked to draw his inspiration from writings of his time. Gault de Saint-Germain said about him that \"Ariosto, Boccaccio, La Fontaine were his inspirers and his ingenious teachers, spiritual in the inventiveness, he got sometimes the freshness of the color of his inimitable models.\"\n", "\nArtist: Antoine-Jean Gros\nArtwork Name: Bonaparte at the Pont D'Arcole\nArtwork Genre: history painting,portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/antoine-jean-gros/bonaparte-at-the-pont-darcole-1796\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBonaparte at the Pont d\u2019Arcole (French: Bonaparte au Pont d\u2019Arcole) is a 1796 painting by Antoine-Jean Gros, showing an episode during the Battle of Arcole in November 1796, with General Napoleon Bonaparte leading his troops to storm the bridge.\r The painting presents a three-quarter-length image of Bonaparte, holding the flagstaff of the arm\u00e9e d'Italie in his left hand and his sword in his right - on its blade is the inscription Bonaparte, Arm\u00e9e d'Italie.

The scene shows Napoleon during a striking scene which occurred in Jaffa on 11 March 1799, when then General Bonaparte made a daring and spectacular visit to his sick soldiers at the Armenian Saint Nicholas Monastery. It was an attempt to quell unsavoury rumours that Napoleon had ordered that fifty incurable dying plague victims in Jaffa be given fatal doses of opium during his retreat from his Syrian expedition.\r This is part of the collection of French paintings at the Louvre.\r On 18 September 1804, the painting was exhibited at the Salon de Paris, between Napoleon's proclamation as emperor on 18 May and his coronation at Notre-Dame de Paris on 2 December. Dominique Vivant Denon, who participated in Bonaparte's expedition to Egypt and was now director of the mus\u00e9e du Louvre, acted as advisor to Gros on it.\r This painting uses elements of the composition of Jacques-Louis David's 1784 Oath of the Horatii, also held at the Louvre, such as the three arcades from Oath which defined three different worlds (the three sons making the oath in the left one; the father brandishing the swords in the middle; the women abandoned to sadness in the right-hand one), a principle taken up in this painting too.\r It is sometimes mistaken to be set in a mosque but is actually set in the Armenian Saint Nicholas Monastery, whose courtyard can be seen in the background.

The light of the painting and the play of colours all paint Bonaparte's gesture in the best possible light.\r The capture and violent sack of Jaffa by the French army under Bonaparte on 7 March 1799 were rapidly followed by an outbreak of bubonic plague, identified by January 1799, which decimated the army. On 11 March, Bonaparte made a spectacular visit to his sick soldiers, touching them, which was considered to be either magnificent or suicidal according to one's point of view on the Napoleonic legend or of the terrors of an age of plagues.\n", "\nArtist: Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault\nArtwork Name: Officer of the Chasseurs Charging on Horseback (Charging Hussar)\nArtwork Genre: battle painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-gericault/officer-of-the-chasseurs-charging-on-horseback\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Charging Chasseur, or An Officer of the Imperial Horse Guards Charging is an oil painting on canvas of about 1812 by the French painter Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault, portraying a mounted Napoleonic cavalry officer who is ready to attack.

G\u00e9ricault would continue to move away from classicism, as exemplified in his masterpiece The Raft of the Medusa (1818\u201319).\r The turning figure on a rearing horse is derived from the large early Rubens Saint George (Museo del Prado, 1605\u201307), though there the view is from the side.\n", "\nArtist: Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault\nArtwork Name: The Wounded Cuirassier\nArtwork Genre: battle painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-gericault/the-wounded-cuirassier-1814\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Wounded Cuirassier (French: Le Cuirassier bless\u00e9 quittant le feu) is an oil painting of a single anonymous soldier descending a slope with his horse by the French Romantic painter and lithographer Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault (1791\u20131824). In this 1814 Salon entry, G\u00e9ricault decided to depict a different view of battle than the generally done views of entire battles or of famous generals bravely fighting. On display just a few months after Napoleon's fall from power, this life-size painting symbolized the French defeats and Napoleon's failure. Though the painting is called The Wounded Cuirassier, there are no visible wounds on the soldier. Additionally, though G\u00e9ricault generally created several drafts before settling on a final design, there do not seem to be any paintings of his that could be considered precursors to this painting. Only his Signboard of a Hoofsmith, which is currently in a private collection, bears any resemblance in form or function to this painting.

Completed when the artist was 27, the work has become an icon of French Romanticism. At 491\u00a0cm \u00d7 716\u00a0cm (16' 1\" \u00d7 23' 6\"), it is an over-life-size painting that depicts a moment from the aftermath of the wreck of the French naval frigate M\u00e9duse, which ran aground off the coast of today's Mauritania on 2 July 1816. On 5 July 1816, at least 147 people were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in the 13\u00a0days before their rescue, and those who survived endured starvation and dehydration and practised cannibalism. The event became an international scandal, in part because its cause was widely attributed to the incompetence of the French captain.\r G\u00e9ricault chose to depict this event in order to launch his career with a large-scale uncommissioned work on a subject that had already generated great public interest. The event fascinated him, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of the flesh of the dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 Paris Salon, attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation, and today is widely seen as seminal in the early history of the Romantic movement in French painting.\r Although The Raft of the Medusa retains elements of the traditions of history painting, in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents a break from the calm and order of the prevailing Neoclassical school. G\u00e9ricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The Louvre acquired it soon after the artist's death at the age of 32. The painting's influence can be seen in the works of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, J. M. W. Turner, Gustave Courbet, and \u00c9douard Manet.\r In June 1816, the French frigate M\u00e9duse departed from Rochefort, bound for the Senegalese port of Saint-Louis. She headed a convoy of three other ships: the storeship Loire, the brig Argus and the corvette \u00c9cho. Viscount Hugues Duroy de Chaumereys had been appointed captain of the frigate despite having scarcely sailed in 20\u00a0years. After the wreck, public outrage mistakenly attributed responsibility for his appointment to Louis XVIII, though his was a routine naval appointment made within the Ministry of the Navy and far outside the concerns of the monarch. The frigate's mission was to accept the British return of Senegal under the terms of France's acceptance of the Peace of Paris. The appointed French governor of Senegal, Colonel Julien-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Schmaltz, and his wife and daughter were among the passengers.\n", "\nArtist: Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault\nArtwork Name: The Epsom Derby\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-gericault/the-epsom-derby-1821\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe 1821 Derby at Epsom, or Horse Race (Course de chevaux, traditionally called Le Derby de 1821 \u00e0 Epsom) is an 1821 painting by Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault in the Louvre Museum, showing The Derby of that year.\r Fascinated by the horses, G\u00e9ricault made many paintings portraying them. Working for a while at the imperial stables, he had the opportunity to study in detail and made numerous portraits of horses. This work is not related to that series of portraits but it illustrates a similar theme horses, as the artist has done many times, such as in Officer Hunter Horse of the Imperial Guard Charging in 1812 or Race of Free Horses in Rome in 1819.\r This work is a rare and valuable example of painting dated from his travel in England, when G\u00e9ricault preferred to work in lithography.

It is part of series of ten portraits made for the psychiatrist \u00c9tienne-Jean Georget and is currently kept in the Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent, Belgium.\r The painting belongs to a series of ten portraits of the insane inmates of Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re asylum in Paris. G\u00e9ricault made it nearly the end of his career and the five remaining portraits from the series represent the painter's last triumph. Psychiatrist \u00c9tienne-Jean Georget, one of the founders of social psychiatry, asked G\u00e9ricault to do this painting which would represent each clinical models of disease. Georget believed that dementia was a modern disease, which depended in large part of social progress in industrialized countries. He believed that the madmen who were mentally ill need help. Instead of bringing the ill persons in a class room to examine their physical characteristics, the doctor instructed G\u00e9ricault to paint models representing different types of madness. Dr. Georget much appreciated the objectivity in this series of works that established a link between romantic art and empirical science.\r The work was made quickly, which prefigured the concerns of the Impressionists. However, the painting did not belong to Impressionism. At the time, to give dignity to those who were mentally ill was new: they were generally excluded from society, and the previous works represented madmen as possessed creatures or ludicrous people, according to a medieval belief.\r G\u00e9ricault tried to show objectively the patient's face: the empty gaze of the kleptomaniac goes to infinity and his face is rigid, with a neglected beard and dirty neck. The paintings are noteworthy for their bravura style, expressive realism, and for their documenting of the psychological discomfort of individuals, made all the more poignant by the history of insanity in G\u00e9ricault's family, as well as the artist's own fragile mental health.\r  Media related to Portrait of a Kleptomaniac at Wikimedia Commons\n", "\nArtist: Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault\nArtwork Name: The Woman with Gambling Mania\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-gericault/the-woman-with-gambling-mania-1822\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Woman with Gambling Mania is an 1822 painting by Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault.

The painting is famous for featuring in a sympathetic way what were then the lowest ranks of rural society; this was received poorly by the French upper classes.\r Millet's The Gleaners was preceded by a vertical painting of the image in 1854 and an etching in 1855. Millet unveiled The Gleaners at the Salon in 1857. It immediately drew negative criticism from the middle and upper classes, who viewed the topic with suspicion: one art critic, speaking for other Parisians, perceived in it an alarming intimation of \"the scaffolds of 1793.\" Having recently come out of the French Revolution of 1848, these prosperous classes saw the painting as glorifying the lower-class worker. To them, it was a reminder that French society was built upon the labor of the working masses, and landowners linked this working class with the growing movement of Socialism. The depiction of the working class in The Gleaners made the upper classes feel uneasy about their status. The masses of workers greatly outnumbered the members of the upper class. This disparity in numbers meant that if the lower class was to revolt, the upper class would be overturned. With the French Revolution still fresh on the minds of the upper classes, this painting was not perceived well at all.\r Millet's The Gleaners was also not perceived well due to its large size, 33 inches by 44 inches, or 84 by 112 centimetres. This is huge for a painting depicting labor. Normally this size of a canvas was reserved for religious or mythological style paintings. Millet's work did not depict anything religiously affiliated, nor was there any reference to any mythological beliefs. The painting illustrated a realistic view of poverty and the working class. One critic commented that \"his three gleaners have gigantic pretensions, they pose as the Three Fates of Poverty...their ugliness and their grossness unrelieved.\" While the act of gleaning was not a new topic\u2014representations of Ruth had existed in art\u2014this new work was a statement on rural poverty and not Biblical piety: there is no touch of the Biblical sense of community and compassion in the contrasting embodiments of grinding poverty in the foreground and the rich harvest in the sunlit distance beyond. The implicit irony was unsettling. After the Salon, Millet, short on money, sold his piece for 3,000 francs\u2014below his asking price of 4,000\u2014after haggling with an Englishman named Binder who would not budge for his meagre counter-offer; Millet tried to keep the miserable price a secret. While The Gleaners garnered little but notoriety during his life, after his death in 1875, public appreciation of his work steadily broadened. In 1889, the painting, then owned by banker Ferdinand Bischoffsheim, sold for 300,000 francs at auction. The buyer remained anonymous, but rumours were that the painting was coveted by an American buyer. It was announced less than a week later that Champagne powerhouse Jeanne-Alexandrine Louise Pommery had acquired the piece, which silenced gossip on her supposed financial issues after leaving her grapes on the vines weeks longer than her competitors.\n", "\nArtist: Jean-Francois Millet\nArtwork Name: The Angelus\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-francois-millet/the-angelus-1859\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Angelus (L'Ang\u00e9lus) is an oil painting by French painter Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet, completed between 1857 and 1859.\r The painting depicts two peasants bowing in a field over a basket of potatoes to say a prayer, the Angelus, that together with the ringing of the bell from the church on the horizon marks the end of a day's work.\r Millet was commissioned by the American would-be painter and art collector Thomas Gold Appleton, who never came to collect it. The painting is famous today for driving the prices for artworks of the Barbizon school up to record amounts in the late 19th century.\r Millet said: \"The idea for The Angelus came to me because I remembered that my grandmother, hearing the church bell ringing while we were working in the fields, always made us stop work to say the Angelus prayer for the poor departed\". Completed between 1857 and 1859, it is an oil painting on canvas. When Appleton failed to take possession, Millet added a steeple and changed the initial title of the work, Prayer for the Potato Crop, to The Angelus.\r It depicts two peasants during the potato harvest in Barbizon, with a view of the church tower of Chailly-en-Bi\u00e8re. At their feet is a small basket of potatoes, and around them a cart and a pitchfork. Various interpretations of the relationship between the two peasants have been made, such as colleagues at work, husband and wife pair, or (as Gambetta interpreted it) farmer and maidservant. An 1889 sales catalogue described them simply as \"a young peasant and his companion\". Millet sold The Angelus after his The Gleaners was sold at the Salon in 1857. About half the size, it brought him less than half the amount he sold The Gleaners for. The Angelus was eventually shown the year before Millet's death in Brussels in 1874, where it was greatly admired by L\u00e9on Gambetta.\r Much later, Salvador Dal\u00ed saw a print of this painting in his school and insisted that this was a funeral scene, not a prayer ritual and that the couple were portrayed praying and mourning over their dead infant. Although this was an unpopular view, at his insistence the Louvre X-rayed the painting, showing a small painted-over geometric shape strikingly similar to a coffin by the basket. It seems possible that Millet originally painted a burial \u2013 perhaps a rural version of Courbet's famous painting A Burial at Ornans (1850) \u2013 but then converted it to a recitation of the Angelus, complete with a visible church bell tower.\r At first, the painting was interpreted as a political statement, with Millet viewed as a socialist in solidarity with the workers. While the painting expresses a profound sense of religious devotion, and became one of the most widely reproduced religious paintings of the 19th century, with prints displayed by thousands of devout householders across France, Millet painted it from a sense of nostalgia rather than from any strong religious feeling. According to Karine Huguenaud, \"There is, however, no religious message to the painting: Millet was simply concerned with portraying a ritualised moment of meditation taking place as the dusk rolls in.\" In 1864 Belgian minister Jules Van Pra\u00ebt exchanged it for Millet\u2019s Berg\u00e8re avec son troupeau (Shepherd and his flock) and commented dryly, \u201cWhat can I say? It is clearly a masterpiece, but faced with these two peasants, whose work is interrupted by prayer, everyone thinks they can hear the nearby church bell tolling, and in the end, the constant ringing just became tiresome\u201d.\n", "\nArtist: Gustave Moreau\nArtwork Name: Oedipus and the Sphinx\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-moreau/the-sphinx-1864\n\nWikipedia Article:\nOedipus and the Sphinx is an 1864 oil on canvas painting by Gustave Moreau that was first exhibited at the French Salon of 1864 where it was an immediate success. It is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The work was a fresh treatment of the established subject of the meeting between Oedipus and the Sphinx on the road to Delphi, notably portrayed at Sophocles' play Oedipus Rex.\r The painting depicts Oedipus meeting the Sphinx at the crossroads on his journey between Thebes and Delphi. Oedipus must answer the Sphinx's riddle correctly in order to pass. Failure means his own death and that of the besieged Thebans. The riddle was: \"What walks on four feet in the morning, two in the afternoon and three at night?\". Oedipus answered: \"Man: as an infant, he crawls on all fours; as an adult, he walks on two legs and; in old age, he uses a walking stick\". Oedipus was the first to answer the riddle correctly and, having heard Oedipus' answer, the Sphinx was astounded and inexplicably killed herself by throwing herself into the sea. Oedipus thereby won the freedom of the Thebans, the kingdom of that city and a wife Jocasta, who it was later revealed was his mother.\r In this work Moreau deliberately rejects the realism and naturalism in vogue in mid nineteenth century France, instead adopting a deliberately archaic painting style and mythological subject matter. Moreau had sketched Ingres' 1808 Oedipus and the Sphinx in Paris and that is a likely source for his version of the story. Ingres also painted a later version (c. 1826) which is now in the National Gallery, London, but it is uncertain whether Moreau saw that work. The influence of Italian Renaissance master Andrea Mantegna has also been detected in Moreau's version.\r Unlike Ingres' version where Oedipus appears as the dominant figure with the Sphinx on the defensive and partly obscured, in Moreau's version the Sphinx is on the offensive, clawing at Oedipus whose victory in the encounter does not yet seem assured. Indeed, other works by Moreau often feature victorious sphinxes atop a mound of victims.\r The Sphinx in the painting may be seen as a form of femme fatale, a common theme in late nineteenth century arts and particularly of Symbolist painting. Ragnar von Holten has argued that the subject depicts not only the battle between good and evil, but also between the sexes, and that the opening poem of Buch der Leider by Heinrich Heine was the source for the idea of the painting. In that poem the Sphinx triumphs over Oedipus. In a Freudian interpretation, it has been argued that the Sphinx represents the castrating effect of Moreau's mother that he has seeking to escape. At the time the painting was created, Moreau's father had recently died.\r By contrast, Henri Dorra has suggested that the poses of the sphinx and Oedipus are derived from the Greek etymological meaning of the word sphinx, which is to clutch, embrace, or cling to. Dorra notes that a paper on the subject by Michel Br\u00e9al had been published in 1863, the year before the work was painted. Dorra also draws attention to the symbolic meaning of some of the elements in the picture, which could have autobiographical aspects, and the possible derivation of the treatment of the subject from the design of a Bithynian coin of Nicomedes II depicting Zeus leaning on a staff with an eagle on his right.\n", "\nArtist: Gustave Moreau\nArtwork Name: The Apparition\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: watercolor\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-moreau/the-apparition-1876\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Apparition (French: L'Apparition) is a painting by French artist Gustave Moreau, painted between 1874 and 1876. It shows the biblical character of Salome dancing in front of Herod Antipas with a vision of John the Baptist's head. The 106\u00a0cm high and 72,2\u00a0cm wide watercolor held by the Paris Musee d'Orsay elaborates an episode told in the Gospel of Matthew 14:6-11 and Mark 6:21-29. On a feast on the occasion of Herod Antipas' birthday, the princess Salome dances in front of the king and his guest, pleasing him so much he promises her anything she wished for. Incited by her mother Herodias, who was reproved by the imprisoned John the Baptist for her illegitimate marriage to Herod, Salome demands John's head in a charger. Regretful but compelled to keep his word in front of his peers, Herod fulfills Salome's demand. John the Baptist is beheaded, the head brought in a charger and given to Salome, who gives it to her mother.\r Moreau approached the biblical theme in 19 paintings, 6 watercolors and more than 150 drawings. Part of a series of at least 8 closely resembling paintings and more than 40 sketch drawings, it is regarded a key work of Moreau's opus, symbolism and fin de si\u00e8cle art in general. Upon its first presentation 1876 in Salon (French: Salon de Paris), the painting caused a sensation. It has since made a lasting impression on various artists, notably from the Decadent movement.\r Against the backdrop of a lavishly decorated palace inspired by the Alhambra  Salome stands out in an array of bejeweled veils, her body facing the viewer, her left arm pointing up in the air to John the Baptist's hovering head, enclosed by a halo. At the back in the half-light stands the executioner with his sword, at his feet the silver charger. Seated in ascending position on Salome's side are a lutanist, Herodias and Herod Antipas. They face the foreground events seemingly lit by John's halo and its reflections on Salome's costume. The severed head recalls a Japanese print copied by Moreau at the Palais de l'Industrie in 1869 as well as the severed head of Medusa as held by Benvenuto Cellini's bronze Perseus with the head of Medusa in Florence (Loggia dei Lanzi). Since no one, including Salome, reacts directly to the vision central to the composition, it is unclear if it is real, imagined by the princess or a collective hallucination. This deliberately confusing technique has been attributed to an alleged consumption of opium and thereby caused hallucinations, though justification of such claims was never established. Its surreal setting and mystic air, evoked by obscure architectural and textile opulence, contrast with previous interpretations of the subject, making The Apparition a key work for the emerging symbolist movement.\r Belgian art dealer L\u00e9on Gauchez bought The Appariton in 1876 upon its first presentation at the Salon where it was exhibited with several other of Moreau's works. The following year Gauchez sent it to be exhibited at London's Grosvenor Gallery where it hung not with the aquarelles in a separate room but in the main East Gallery with the oil paintings. Currently it is located in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay.\n", "\nArtist: Gustave Moreau\nArtwork Name: Jupiter and Semele\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-moreau/jupiter-and-semele-1895-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJupiter et Semele (1894-95; English, Jupiter and Semele) is a painting by the French Symbolist artist Gustave Moreau (1826-1898). It depicts a moment from the classical myth of the mortal woman Semele, mother of the god Dionysus, and her lover, Jupiter, the king of the gods. She was treacherously advised by the goddess Juno, Jupiter\u2019s wife, to ask him to appear to her in all his divine splendor. He obliged, but, in so doing, brought about her violent death by his divine thunder and lightning. The painting is a representation of \"divinized physical love\" and the overpowering experience that consumes Semele as the god appears in his supreme beauty which has been called \"quite simply the most sumptuous expression imaginable of an orgasm\".\r Of this work, Moreau himself wrote, \"Semele, penetrated by the divine effluence, regenerated and purified by this consecration, dies struck by lightning and with her dies the genius of terrestrial love, the genius with the goat hooves\".\r Moreau described his canvas thus:\r Moreau\u2019s work depicts an intricate, intense, and startling mystical world, haunting and heavily laden with symbolic imagery. Its iconography is drawn from the ancient myth, from Symbolist writings and from his own personal interpretations, which are deliberately meant to be mysterious and ambiguous. Jupiter is represented conventionally, seated \u201cin Majesty\u201d with the hapless and bloodied Semele astride his right thigh. His gaze is severe, wide-eyed and fixed straight ahead in fierce prepossession. His throne and surrounding court, however, present an unorthodox and extravagant profusion of architectural and vegetal elements which \u2014 while depicted in fine, realistic, even jewel-like, detail \u2014 give the overall impression of a dream-like fantasy world. Everywhere a profusion of vivid colors vies with dark shadows for prominence. Countless teaming gods, goddesses and allegorical figures seem to exist at different scales, independent of, and oblivious to, one another. The eye must accommodate bizarre shifts in proportion as it ranges across the canvas. Among the figures are three immediately at the feet of Jupiter: a figure of \"Sadness\" (cradling a bloodied sword), a Great Pan, and a female \u201cDeath\u201d holding aloft a white lily. (Moreau: \u201cAt the foot of the throne, Death and Sorrow form the tragic basis of Human Life, and not far from them, under the aegis of the eagle of Jupiter, the great Pan, symbol of Earth, bows his sorrowful brow, mourning his slavery and exile, while at his feet is piled the somber phalanx of the monsters of Erebus and Night\u2026.\u201d) Jupiter's right foot rests on a snake biting its own tail. A frightful Hecate, with her polos and crescent moon, appears in the lower left corner. Among the other figures are a three-headed demon and several winged, angelic figures.\r The French writer and painter Malcolm de Chazal (1902-1981) called the central image of Jupiter and Semele \u201cthis birth-death in one\u201d. The Swedish surrealist Ragnar von Holten (1934-2009) described the work as \u201can allegory of regeneration by death\u201d.\r The theme of Jupiter and Semele has also been interpreted by the painters Jacopo Tintoretto (ca. 1545) and Jean-Baptiste Deshays de Colleville (ca. 1760).\n", "\nArtist: Edgar Degas\nArtwork Name: Young Spartans Exercising\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: board,canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas/young-spartans-exercising-1860-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nYoung Spartans Exercising, also known as Young Spartans and also as Young Spartan Girls Challenging Boys, is an early oil on canvas painting by French impressionist artist Edgar Degas. The work depicts two groups of male and female Spartan youth exercising and challenging each other in some way. The work is now in the permanent collection of the National Gallery in London.\r The painting depicts as its subject matter two groups of older children, four girls and five boys, with the girls apparently taunting or beckoning the boys. The girls are positioned to the left of the painting, the boys to the right, while in-between the two groups in the background appear a third group watching them; their appearance striking as they are fully dressed while the youth in the foreground stand naked or topless. Behind the onlookers, identified as Lycurgus and the mothers of the children, lies the city of Sparta, dominated by Mount Taygetus, from which the bodies of the society's \"unfit\" children were supposedly thrown into a ravine, to die from trauma or exposure.\r The painting was begun in 1860 with Degas returning to the canvas to rework the piece over the following years, though it remained unfinished upon the artist's death. X-rays taken of the work during the early 21st century have revealed that Degas changed the positioning of the youths, their faces, and even their number; this last change resulted in the strange image of the four women in the foreground having ten legs among them. Degas' revisitation of the faces of the young people is often mentioned in art criticism, as it is believed the artist changed the features of the youths from the classic handsome Greek ideal, to a more urban modernistic look. The French art historian Andr\u00e9 Lemoisne, was first to note on this fact, remarking that the subjects had a contemporary Parisian look, more akin to the \"gamins of Montmartre\". More recent critics agree with Lemoisne, believing Degas was attempting to \"update\" his painting.\r A second full-scale version of the painting exists, held by the Art Institute of Chicago. This version is much less finished, but it shows a vastly different background, with a more detailed landscape and a large architectural structure, around which the characters in the background are resting. The work also shows how Degas changed the number of foreground figures with an additional boy on the right of the painting.\r Young Spartans Exercising was purchased by the National Gallery in 1924 and, as of late 2013, is displayed in Room 41.\r In 1879, Italian art critic Diego Martelli described the unfinished work as \"one of the most classicizing paintings imaginable\"; though after Martelli's remarks, Degas returned to the painting and removed the classicizing architecture.\r In a 1985 edition of The Art Bulletin, art critic Carol Salus hypothesises that the work \"... has traditionally been interpreted as representing young women challenging young men to wrestle or race, is instead a presentation of Spartan courtship rites\". This position was challenged in the same publication the following year, with Linda Nochlin arguing that the work could encompass a variety of meanings, and by referring to Degas' own reluctance to explain the work in any great detail, allows the viewer to interpret the work to their own merit. This view is echoed by Christopher Riopelle, curator of 19th-century painting at the National Gallery, who in 2004 stated that the painting, \"...starts as a traditional historical painting, closely based on classical accounts and meticulous research. It ends as something much more enigmatic.\"\n", "\nArtist: Edgar Degas\nArtwork Name: The Bellelli Family\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas/the-belleli-family-1862\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Bellelli Family, also known as Family Portrait, is an oil painting on canvas by Edgar Degas (1834\u20131917), painted ca. 1858\u20131867, and housed in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. A masterwork of Degas' youth, the painting is a portrait of his aunt, her husband, and their two young daughters.\r While finishing his artistic training in Italy, Degas drew and painted his aunt Laura, her husband the baron Gennaro Bellelli (1812\u20131864), and their daughters Giulia and Giovanna. Although it is not known for certain when or where Degas executed the painting, it is believed that he utilized studies done in Italy to complete the work after his return to Paris. Laura, his father's sister, is depicted in a dress which symbolizes mourning for her father, who had recently died and appears in the framed portrait behind her. The baron was an Italian patriot exiled from Naples, living in Florence.\r Laura Bellelli's countenance is dignified and austere, her gesture connected with those of her daughters. Her husband, by contrast, appears to be separated from his family. His association with business and the outside world is implied by his position at his desk. Giulia holds a livelier pose than that of her sister Giovanna, whose restraint appears to underscore the familial tensions.\r In 1856 Degas left his home in Paris to study art and visit family relations in Italy, arriving in Naples on 17 July. In 1857 he traveled between Naples, where he stayed with his grandfather, Hilaire Degas, and Rome. At the end of July 1858 Laura Bellelli wrote to Degas from Naples, inviting him to stay with her in Florence; it was there that Gennaro Bellelli, who had been a political journalist supporting the fight for Italy's independence, took refuge from Austrian persecution after defeat of the Revolution of 1848. Degas arrived in Florence by 4 August, living with his uncle Gennaro and making studies in the Uffizi. By September he had become bored, did not get along well with Gennaro, and remained only to see Laura, Giovanna, and Giulia, who had prolonged their stay in Naples following the death of Degas' grandfather Hilaire on 31 August.\r That there were strains within the Bellelli household at the time was almost certainly noticed by Degas, and confirmed by another uncle: \"The domestic life of the family in Florence is a source of unhappiness for us. As I predicted, one of them is very much at fault and our sister a little, too.\" Laura subsequently confided to Degas that, living in exile, she missed her Neapolitan family, and further, that her husband was \"immensely disagreeable and dishonest... Living with Gennaro, whose detestable nature you know and who has no serious occupation, shall soon lead me to the grave.\" Laura Bellelli was pregnant at the time, and it has been suggested that this circumstance, and the subsequent death of the child in infancy, may have contributed to her unhappiness and to domestic tensions in general. These conflicts would provide both background and content for the painting.\r After his aunt and cousins returned in early November 1858, Degas undertook a series of works that would eventually culminate in The Bellelli Family. It appears that he initially planned to paint a vertical composition depicting his aunt and her two daughters in a pyramidical grouping. He painted his cousins in their black dresses and white pinafores, while his father wrote letters from Paris, offering advice on how best to proceed with the project, and impatiently awaited his return. Degas wrote of Giulia and Giovanna:\n", "\nArtist: Edgar Degas\nArtwork Name: Comte Le Pic and his Sons\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas/comte-le-pic-and-his-sons\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLudovic Lepic and His Daughters (French: Ludovic Lepic et ses filles) is a painting by Edgar Degas that was completed around 1871.

In it, Degas depicts his uncle Michel Musson's cotton brokerage business (which several years later went bankrupt in an economic crash, according to Michael McMahon of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette when the firm was swamped by the postwar growth of the much larger Cotton Exchange). In the painting, Musson is seen examining raw cotton for its quality while Degas' brother Rene reads The Daily Picayune. Another brother, Achille, rests against a window wall at left while others, including Musson's partners, go about their business.\r A Cotton Office in New Orleans was the first painting by Degas to be purchased by a museum, and the first by an Impressionist. Degas' sale of the piece marked a turning point in his career as he moved from being a struggling, unrecognized artist to a recognized and financially stable artist, according to Marilyn Brown in her book Degas and the Business of Art: A Cotton Office in New Orleans.\r Degas traveled from Europe to New Orleans in late 1872 with his brother, Ren\u00e9, to visit his mother's brother, Michael Musson. After the American Civil War, Ren\u00e9 had joined his uncle's cotton business in New Orleans. Degas was to return to Europe in January 1873, but when his return trip was delayed, he was asked by his relatives to paint their portraits, and decided to show them as a group, at work in the family office.\r Degas crafted his work with the intent of selling it to a British textile manufacturer. But a drop in stock prices worldwide and declines in the cotton and art markets ended his hopes for that specific sale. Degas then exhibited A Cotton Office in New Orleans in the second Impressionist show in Paris in 1876. Degas finally sold the painting in 1878 to the newly founded Musee des Beaux-Arts in Pau, France.\r The painting is sometimes mistakenly referred to as The Cotton Exchange at New Orleans, referring to the historic New Orleans Cotton Exchange.\n", "\nArtist: Edgar Degas\nArtwork Name: Place de la Concorde\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas/place-de-la-concorde-1875\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPlace de la Concorde or Viscount Lepic and his Daughters Crossing the Place de la Concorde is an 1876 oil painting by Edgar Degas.

Completed in about 1879, the painting was already in the collection of the French banker Ernest May when it was listed in the catalogue of the fourth Impressionist exhibition that year. It may also have been shown in the next Impressionist exhibit in 1880, but it was not well known until it entered the collections of the Louvre in 1923. The canvas shows an interior corner of the open trading floor of the Paris Stock Exchange (The Paris Bourse). May stands in the centre of the picture wearing a top hat and pince-nez, listening to his colleague, a certain M. Bol\u00e2tre, leaning over his shoulder. They are likely discussing a document, possibly a bordereau, held aloft by a partially obscured third party.\r Although the owner and possible commissioner of the work was himself Jewish, art historian Linda Nochlin has interpreted the painting as an anti-Semitic depiction of Jews in Paris, due especially to the exaggerated features and postures of the subjects. British art historian Richard Shone has written about the oil painting and its pastel study without mentioning anti-Semitism. In stark contrast to Nochlin, he describes the figures as having \"humdrum features.\" May himself, according to Shone, is depicted as a \"seasoned figure\" whose \"expression gives nothing away.\"  While anti-Semitism has a long history in France, there is little evidence of Degas' holding this attitude until the time of the Dreyfus affair two decades later.\r The technique of Portraits at the Stock Exchange can be more closely related to Impressionism than many of Degas's earlier works. Evidence for this can be found in the painting's quickly applied, sketchy brushstrokes. The psychological perspective of the painting is one of detachment, a common viewpoint in Impressionist paintings. This painting currently resides in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris. A smaller, pastel sketch of the same subject can be found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n", "\nArtist: Edgar Degas\nArtwork Name: Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas/miss-la-la-at-the-cirque-fernando-1879\n\nWikipedia Article:\nMiss La La at the Cirque Fernando is a painting by Edgar Degas, the French Impressionist artist, now in the collection of the National Gallery in London, England.

It is in The Walters Art Museum collection.\r Alfred Sisley can be distinguished from other Impressionists by his commitment to landscape painting. In 1872, he moved his family to Louveciennes, where he painted the nearby view of the Seine Vally at St.-Germain-en-Laye. Over the course of his career he painted nearly 900 oil paintings, which were mainly landscapes spanning from the forest of Fontainebleau and Louveciennes, London to Moret and Wales. He would often focus on the serenity of pastoral settings.\r The Terrace at Saint-Germain, Spring represents a panoramic view of the Seine Valley and captures the light associated with Springtime. The painting portrays a seemingly limitless area of countryside. The river is shown winding away from Paris, in the foreground, laborers work in a vineyard and a lone female walks through the orchard. In the distance, there is a chateau, which housed the royal court until 1682. Modern aspects of the painting include the steam-powered tugboats pulling barges and the railroad bridge.\r Until December 31, 2013, a reproduction of The Terrace at Saint-Germain, Spring was on display at Robert E. Lee Park as part of Off the Wall, an open-air exhibition on the streets of Baltimore, Maryland.

The full-length painting depicts model Lise Tr\u00e9hot posing in a forest. She wears a white muslin dress and holds a black lace parasol to shade her from the sunlight, which filters down through the leaves, contrasting her face in the shadow and her body in the light, highlighting her dress rather than her face. After having several paintings rejected by the Salon, Renoir's Lise was finally accepted and exhibited in May 1868.\r The painting was one of Renoir's first critically successful works. At this time, Renoir's technique was still influenced by Gustave Courbet, but he continued to develop his unique style painting filtered light which he would return to in The Swing (1876) and Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette (1876). The almost life-size portrait and unusual contrast in Lise led several critics to ridicule the work. Th\u00e9odore Duret, a passionate supporter of the nascent Impressionists, bought the painting from Renoir, who was unable to sell it. Karl Ernst Osthaus, a German patron of avant-garde art, acquired Lise in 1901 for the Museum Folkwang.\r Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841\u20131919) grew up in Paris. His father worked as a tailor and his mother as a seamstress. Renoir trained as a porcelain painter but the Industrial Revolution replaced porcelain painters with machines. He found work as a decorative commercial artist during the day while learning to draw in the evenings. In the early 1860s, he spent his free time studying paintings at the Louvre and worked in the studio under Charles Gleyre, spending two years at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. Renoir began submitting his work to the Salon in 1863. His first submission, Nymph and Faun, was rejected, leading Renoir to destroy his painting. The next year, Renoir tried again, submitting La Esm\u00e9ralda to the Salon of 1864. Despite its acceptance, Renoir once again destroyed his painting. Two of Renoir's works, Portrait de William Sisley (1864) and Soir\u00e9e d'\u00e9t\u00e9, were accepted by the Salon of 1865.\r In the mid 1860s, Renoir met Lise Tr\u00e9hot through his friend, artist Jules Le Coeur, who was intimate with Cl\u00e9mence, Lise's sister. From around 1865 to 1872, Lise modeled for Renoir and was his companion during his early Salon period. Meanwhile, Renoir continued to face rejection at the Salon with Paysage avec deux figures (1866) and Diana (1867), two works featuring Lise as a model. Renoir's innovative work as an Impressionist brought great ridicule and poverty, as he was unable to sell his paintings. He survived by devoting himself to painting portraits for wealthy patrons. It would take almost another forty years for the Salon and the wider art community to recognize and acknowledge his contributions to modern art.\r Renoir was 26 years old when he began painting Lise in the summer of 1867, possibly in August. It is unclear if the painting was made in the Fontainebleau forest, close to Chailly-en-Brie near Bourron-Marlotte or in Chantilly.  Further, it is unknown if the painting was completed in the studio or en plein air. Renoir's friend, Edmond Ma\u00eetre, sent a message to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille (1841\u20131870) about Renoir's technique during that summer, writing that Renoir was \"painting strangely, having exchanged turpentine for a vile sulphate and abandoned the palette knife for the little syringue [thin paintbrush] that is known to you\".\n", "\nArtist: Pierre-Auguste Renoir\nArtwork Name: Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/skaters-in-the-bois-de-boulogne-1868\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSkaters in the Bois de Boulogne (French: Les patineurs \u00e0 Longchamp) is an oil-on-canvas landscape painting by the French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir, created during the winter of 1868. The painting depicts a snowscape with a large number of Parisians, young and old, spending leisure time on a frozen park lake. Due to Renoir's strong dislike of cold temperatures and snow, the piece is one of his few winter landscapes.\r Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841\u20131919) first met landscape painters Alfred Sisley (1839\u20131899), Claude Monet (1840\u20131926), and figure painter Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille (1841\u20131870) at the art studio of Swiss artist Charles Gleyre in 1861. In addition to their friendship, all would prove influential in Renoir's work. For the next several years, Renoir attended the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. He first exhibited a large painting at the Salon in 1863, but destroyed his work. That same year, Renoir was living in a studio with Bazille who introduced him to Paul C\u00e9zanne (1839\u20131906) and Camille Pissarro (1830\u20131903).\r An early painting, The Cabaret of M\u00e8re Anthony (1866), represents for Renoir \"some of the most agreeable memories\" of his life with friends at a village inn during this time. He soon moved to the village of Chailly near Marlotte and the forest of Fontainebleau, and began working with model Lise Tr\u00e9hot who posed for him between 1866 and 1872. Renoir began painting at La Grenouill\u00e8re, a popular middle class day resort with a floating dance hall, in late 1868. Like Monet and several other Impressionists, Renoir worked en plein air, painting outdoors, but unlike Monet, who was known for painting in the cold and snow, Renoir was not fond of cold temperatures. Years later, he told art dealer Ambroise Vollard that he could not stand the cold: \"But then, even if you can stand the cold, why paint snow? It is a blight on the face of Nature.\" Although it is unknown when his symptoms began, Renoir was known to suffer from rheumatoid arthritis from at least 1892 onward, an affliction which would severely restrict his artistic production in late life.\r Renoir, who was then 26 years old, painted Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne in the public park of Bois de Boulogne in Paris en plein air during the cold winter month of January 1868. Newspaper accounts of the time recorded freezing temperatures allowing people to walk across the Seine and ice skate on rivers and streams. Due to Renoir's dislike of cold temperatures, it is one of the few winter landscapes he completed aside from a few minor studies. At the time of the painting, the park itself was relatively new, with construction beginning in 1852 under a public works program led by Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann under the direction of Napoleon III. Under Haussmann's renovation of Paris, the Bois de Boulogne was completed in 1858.\r The scene is thought to have been painted near the Lac pour le patinage (Skating Lake), an artificial lake. Renoir chose the park because he preferred painting crowds. The painting has an unfinished, sketch-like quality to it, in the style of a pochade, but the brushwork is bold and the composition fully realized. The scene represents the western part of the park, using an elevated perspective. The theme evokes older Dutch ice skating landscapes made popular by painters like Hendrick Avercamp (1585\u20131634). Several dogs can be seen in the work, reflecting Renoir's thematic interest in the lives of the Parisian bourgeoisie. The motif of social leisure depicted in the piece would come to define Renoir's subsequent work.\n", "\nArtist: Pierre-Auguste Renoir\nArtwork Name: Madame Stora in Algerian Dress\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/madame-stora-in-algerian-dress-1870\n\nWikipedia Article:\nMadame Cl\u00e9mentine Valensi Stora (L'Alg\u00e9rienne) is an oil painting by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, completed in 1870. It depicts a young Jewish woman, Rebecca Cl\u00e9mentine Stora, in Algerian costume and is untypical of Renoir's work, leading to debate about the place of the painting within his oeuvre. Renoir and Stora both later repudiated the work.\r Pierre-Auguste Renoir was closely associated with the Impressionist movement and the painting of modern life in France in the mid-nineteenth century. L'Alg\u00e9rienne is untypical of his output in depicting a named living subject in an oriental costume. Renoir did create a number of Orientalist works including Woman of Algiers (\"Odalisque\") (1870) and Parisian Women in Algerian Costume (The Harem) (1872), however, both were homages to existing works rather than portraits of living people, Ingres' Grande Odalisque (1814, Louvre) in the first case and Delacroix's Women of Algiers in their Apartment (1834, Louvre) in the second. Renoir did not travel abroad until 1881 when he visited Algeria.\r L'Alg\u00e9rienne has been described by Colin Bailey as \"proto-Impressionist\". The broad brush strokes and exuberant use of colour represent a high point in Renoir's temporary rejection of the realism of Gustave Courbet and Eduard Manet in favour of the influence of his hero Delacroix. Later, when his style had changed considerably, Renoir repudiated the work, complaining in connection with it, \"la manie des amateurs de toujours demander ma mani\u00e8re ancienne\".\r The painting depicts a young Sephardic Jewish woman, Rebecca Cl\u00e9mentine Stora, n\u00e9e Valensi (or Valensin), in Algerian costume. Cl\u00e9mentine Valensi was born in Algiers on 24 April 1851 and died in July 1917. She was the daughter of a maker of travel goods. The Stora and Valensi families moved to Paris in the late 1860s when there was growing anti-Semitic feeling in their native Algeria. Cl\u00e9mentine married Nathan Stora in Paris in 1868. He was an antiques dealer who specialised in goods from North Africa and had a shop at 24 Boulevard des Italiens named Au Pacha which later moved to the fashionable boulevard Hausmann. The tourist trade with French Algeria created a strong market for Algerian and North African themed material in France and the business claimed to be suppliers to the Government General of Algeria.\r Research using contemporary photographs has shown that the costume worn by Cl\u00e9mentine in the picture is authentic for a Jewish Algerian woman of her era. Comparisons have also been made with Charles Cordier's bust The Jewish Woman of Algiers, which was shown at the Salon of 1863 and the Exposition Universelle of 1867, and which depicts a woman in a similar costume. The costume was not, however, conventional for 1870's Paris and it is unclear whether the choice of an Algerian theme was an attempt at ethnic authenticity by Renoir or a demand of the Storas. Cl\u00e9mentine's pursed expression seems to indicate that she is not entirely happy with something. If it was the costume, that did not stop her depiction in similar form in 1877 by Brochart. The authenticity of the clothes and the fact that the painting is a portrait of a named living person rules out the idea that the picture is a work of oriental fantasy and places it more in the realm of conventional portraiture, however, questions remain about what Renoir and the Storas were trying to achieve in the work.\n", "\nArtist: Pierre-Auguste Renoir\nArtwork Name: Mother and children\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/mother-and-children\n\nWikipedia Article:\nMother and Children (also known as La Promenade) is an Impressionist painting by Pierre-Auguste Renoir that is housed in the Frick Collection.

It is housed at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris and is one of Impressionism's most celebrated masterpieces. The painting depicts a typical Sunday afternoon at the original Moulin de la Galette in the district of Montmartre in Paris. In the late 19th century, working class Parisians would dress up and spend time there dancing, drinking, and eating galettes into the evening.\r Like other works of Renoir's early maturity, Bal du moulin de la Galette is a typically Impressionist snapshot of real life. It shows a richness of form, a fluidity of brush stroke, and a flickering light.\r From 1879 to 1894 the painting was in the collection of the French painter Gustave Caillebotte; when he died it became the property of the French Republic as payment for death duties. From 1896 to 1929 the painting hung in the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg in Paris. From 1929 it hung in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre until it was transferred to the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in 1986.\r Renoir painted a smaller version of the picture (78 \u00d7 114\u00a0cm) with the same title. The painting is now believed to be in a private collection in Switzerland. Apart from their size, the two paintings are virtually identical, although the smaller is painted in a more fluid manner than the d'Orsay version. One is presumably a copy of the original, but it is not known which is the original. It is not even known which was the one first exhibited at the 3rd Impressionist exhibition of 1877, because although the painting was catalogued and given favourable attention by critics, its entry did not indicate the size of the painting, information that would serve to identify it.\r For many years it was owned by John Hay Whitney. On May 17, 1990, his widow sold the painting for US$78 million at Sotheby's in New York City to Ryoei Saito (Sait\u014d Ry\u014dei), the honorary chairman of Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Company, Japan.\r At the time of sale, it was one of the top two most expensive artworks ever sold, together with van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet, which was also purchased by Saito. Saito caused international outrage when he suggested in 1991 that he intended to cremate both paintings with him when he died. However, when Saito and his companies ran into severe financial difficulties, bankers who held the painting as collateral for loans arranged a confidential sale through Sotheby's to an undisclosed buyer. Although not known for certain, the painting is believed to be in the hands of a Swiss collector.\r As of January\u00a02013 the Bal du moulin de la Galette is sixth (when adjusted for the consumer price index) on the list of most expensive paintings ever sold.\r Renoir conceived his project of painting the dancing at Le Moulin de la Galette in May 1876 and its execution is described in full by his civil servant friend Georges Rivi\u00e8re in his memoir Renoir et ses amis. In the first place, Renoir needed to set up a studio near the mill. A suitable studio was found at an abandoned cottage in the rue Cortot with a garden described by Rivi\u00e8re as a \"beautiful abandoned park\". Several of Renoir's major works were painted in this garden at this time, including La balan\u00e7oire (The Swing). The gardens and its buildings have been preserved as the Mus\u00e9e de Montmartre.\n", "\nArtist: Pierre-Auguste Renoir\nArtwork Name: The Promenade\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/the-promenade\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLa Promenade is an oil on canvas, early Impressionist painting by the French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir, created in 1870. The work depicts a young couple on an excursion outside of the city, walking on a path through a woodland. Influenced by the rococo revival style during the Second Empire, Renoir's La Promenade reflects the older style and themes of eighteenth-century artists like Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard and Jean-Antoine Watteau. The work also shows the influence of Claude Monet on Renoir's new approach to painting.\r The forest was a popular landscape subject for nineteenth-century French artists, particularly the forest of Fontainebleau. Before Renoir, Claude Monet (1840\u20131926) painted Bazille and Camille (Study for \"D\u00e9jeuner sur l'Herbe\") (1865), showing a couple together in the forest. In 1869, Renoir and Monet spent time painting together at La Grenouill\u00e8re. By 1870, Renoir was living in Louveciennes with his mother. Throughout this decade, the eighteenth-century rococo art movement was back in style and Renoir embraced it. France declared war against Germany on July 19, 1870, starting the Franco-Prussian War. Renoir was conscripted and served four months in the cavalry but never saw combat.\r A young man, possibly a canotier, boatman, given his distinctive boater hat, holds the hand of a young woman on a path surrounded by bushes, perhaps on the banks of the Seine, with the implication of an upcoming intimate encounter. The image of lovers walking through a woodland is based on a popular rococo theme. Interpretations of the figure models vary. It is generally believed that the model for the woman in La Promenade was Lise Tr\u00e9hot, Renoir's favorite model and companion during his early Salon period. In the past, it was believed that the man in the painting was landscape painter Alfred Sisley (1839\u20131899) and the woman was Rapha, a companion of musician Edmond Ma\u00eetre (1840\u20131898).\r The original title of the painting is unknown. It first received the title La Promenade by unnamed owners of the work when it was put up for sale in 1898. It was not until 1941 that questions about the original title came to light. Renoir was known to strenuously object to sentimental titles applied by others to his work. \"Why have they given names to my pictures which never represent the reason I painted such and such a subject? My joy consists in painting, and it has never been in my mind to paint a preconceived subject\", Renoir said in his later years. However, Renoir did exhibit a painting with the title of La Promenade in 1876, but that work is now known as Mother and Children.\r In a commentary for the exhibition Origins of Impressionism (1994\u201395), Henri Loyrette writes that La Promenade \"succeeds at last in what Renoir had for so long and so vainly sought: the integration of the figure in a landscape\". Loyrette notes the influence of Monet in La Promenade and the change in Renoir's style since Les Fianc\u00e9s (1868). The Impressionist influence on Renoir, Perrin Stein writes, led to his increasing use of the high-key palette. Renoir's \"lightness and delicacy of touch\" here is, according to art historian John House, reminiscent of rococo artist Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard (1732\u20131806). Critics also view the influence of Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684\u20131721) on this work, particularly in Renoir's use of the intimate couple in the woods, a motif popularized in scenes found in Watteau's f\u00eate galante genre.\n", "\nArtist: Pierre-Auguste Renoir\nArtwork Name: Pink and Blue\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/pink-and-blue-1881\n\nWikipedia Article:\nAlice and Elisabeth Cahen d\u2019Anvers (most commonly referred to as Pink and Blue) is an oil painting by French impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Produced in Paris in 1881, the painting depicts the sisters Alice and Elisabeth, daughters of Louise Cahen d'Anvers and her husband the Jewish banker Louis Rapha\u00ebl Cahen d'Anvers. It is considered one of the most popular works in the collection of the S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art, where it has been conserved since 1952.\r Renoir portrayed the 2 daughters of Louise Cahen d'Anvers and her banker husband Louis Rapha\u00ebl Cahen d'Anvers, the blonde, Elisabeth, born in December 1874, and the younger, Alice, in February 1876, when they were respectively six and five years old. The artist produced many portraits for the families of the Parisian Jewish community at the time, and Louis Cahen d'Anvers, who married Louise de Morpurgo, descendant of a rich family from Trieste, was one of the most wealthy.\r Renoir was commissioned to paint many portraits for this family, which he had met through the collector Charles Ephrussi, who was proprietor of the Gazette des Beaux-Arts and also Louise's lover.. The idea was to make individual portraits of each daughter. Renoir portrayed the couple's oldest daughter, Irene, in a painting nowadays conserved at the Foundation E.G. B\u00fchrle, in Z\u00fcrich. Afterwards, the family decided that the other two sisters would be painted together. Louise paid Renoir 1,500 francs for the painting. \r According to Camesasca, there were many sitting sessions until the end of February 1881, after what Renoir went to Algiers. After some decades, the youngest of the models would remember that \"the boredom of the sitting sessions was recompensed by the pleasure of wearing the elegant lace dress\".\r Alice lived until 1965 and died in Nice, aged 89. In 1895, Alice married the British Army officer Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend who led his command to its destruction at Kut al Amara in 1916. Elisabeth had a tragic destiny. After divorcing from her first husband, the diplomat and count Jean de Forceville, she married Alfred \u00c9mile Denfert Rochereau, whom she later divorced as well. In 1987, during an exhibition of the S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art collection in the Fondation Pierre Gianadda in Martigny, Switzerland, Elisabeth's nephew, Jean de Monbrison, wrote a letter to the museum reporting her sad end: although she was converted to Catholicism at a young age, she was sent to Auschwitz because of her Jewish descent and died on the way to the concentration camp in March 1944, aged 69.\n", "\nArtist: Pierre-Auguste Renoir\nArtwork Name: The Luncheon of the Boating Party\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/the-luncheon-of-the-boating-party-1881-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLuncheon of the Boating Party (1881; French: Le d\u00e9jeuner des canotiers) is a painting by French impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Included in the Seventh Impressionist Exhibition in 1882, it was identified as the best painting in the show by three critics. It was purchased from the artist by the dealer-patron Paul Durand-Ruel and bought in 1923 (for $125,000) from his son by industrialist Duncan Phillips, who spent a decade in pursuit of the work. It is now in The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. It shows a richness of form, a fluidity of brush stroke, and a flickering light.\r The painting, combining figures, still-life, and landscape in one work, depicts a group of Renoir's friends relaxing on a balcony at the Maison Fournaise restaurant along the Seine river in Chatou, France. The painter and art patron, Gustave Caillebotte, is seated in the lower right. Renoir's future wife, Aline Charigot, is in the foreground playing with a small dog, an affenpinscher; she replaced an earlier woman who sat for the painting but with whom Renoir became annoyed. On the table is fruit and wine.\r The diagonal of the railing serves to demarcate the two halves of the composition, one densely packed with figures, the other all but empty, save for the two figures of the proprietor's daughter Louise-Alphonsine Fournaise and her brother, Alphonse Fournaise, Jr, which are made prominent by this contrast. In this painting Renoir has captured a great deal of light. The main focus of light is coming from the large opening in the balcony, beside the large singleted man in the hat. The singlets of both men in the foreground and the table-cloth all work together to reflect this light and send it through the whole composition.\r As he often did in his paintings, Renoir included several of his friends in Luncheon of the Boating Party. Identification of the sitters was made in 1912 by Julius Meier-Graefe. Among them are the following:\r At the Seventh Impressionist Exhibition in 1882, the painting generally received praise from critics. \"It is fresh and free without being too bawdy,\" wrote Paul de Charry in Le Pays, March 10, 1882. In La Vie Moderne (March 11, 1882), Armand Silvestre wrote, \"...one of the best things [Renoir] has painted...There are bits of drawing that are completely remarkable, drawing- true drawing- that is a result of the juxtaposition of hues and not of line. It is one of the most beautiful pieces that this insurrectionist art by Independent artists has produced.\" Alternatively, Le Figaro published Albert Wolff's comment on March 2, 1882: \"If he had learned to draw, Renoir would have a very pretty picture...\" \n", "\nArtist: Pierre-Auguste Renoir\nArtwork Name: By the Seashore\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/by-the-seashore-1883\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBy the Seashore is a painting by Pierre-Auguste Renoir completed in 1883 and now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\r Renoir made a trip to Italy in 1881-82 and was deeply influenced by Renaissance art. After this trip he began to explore a new manner of painting, different from impressionism. He started to emphasize contours and modeling, abandoned the principle that scenes should be painted outdoors to capture light and atmosphere.\r Late in the summer of 1883, Renoir spent about a month in St. Peter Port, the capital of Guernsey, and admired the rocks, cliffs and stunning view of Moulin Huet Bay in St. Martin. He painted the starts of fifteen pictures during his stay, most of which were finished later in his Paris studio. Guernsey lies 48\u00a0km off the coast of mainland Normandy. Both share the same geology and Guernsey fulfills the \"by the sea\" criterion in the exhibition title.\r However, By the Seashore is thought to have been painted in the artist's studio. The beach depicted here is probably not in the Channel Islands but near Dieppe, on the Normandy coast. The model was Aline Charigot, his then girlfriend, whom he married in 1890. The arc of the sitter's dark eyebrows and saucily tilted nose in that pleasant, rosy-cheeked face are common to works by Renoir.\r The painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan since 1929 from the bequest of Mrs. H.

He bought it in 1886, exhibited it for the first time in April 1883, and kept it until Renoir's death in 1919. A complementary painting on the same theme, named Dance in the City, was also painted by Renoir the same year.\r The painting, influenced by the artist's trip in Italy in 1881 where he found inspiration from Raphael, marked an evolution of the painter who tried then to break away from Impressionism.\r The painting depicts a couple dancing under a chestnut tree: the man is Paul Lh\u00f4te, a friend of the painter, and the woman is Aline Charigot, who later became the wife of the painter.

It is owned by the National Gallery in London as part of the Lane Bequest but is displayed alternately in London and at the Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane. In May 2013, it returned to Dublin for a six-year period.\r Renoir began the painting in about 1880\u201381, using the loose brushwork with dark and bright tones typical of the Impressionist movement. In about 1885-6, after losing his attachment to Impressionism and drawing inspiration from classical art he had seen in Italy and the works of Ingres and C\u00e9zanne, he reworked parts of the painting, particularly the principal female figure to the left of the frame, in a more classical linear style using more muted colours, and added the background and the umbrellas themselves. X-ray photography has shown that the clothing of the female figure was originally different: she wore a hat and her dress had horizontal rows of frills, with white lace at its cuffs and collar, suggesting that she was middle class, whereas the simpler clothes in the revised painting mark her out as a member of the working class, a grisette not a bourgeoise. The x-ray analysis and then the changing fashions allow the periods of work to be dated with reasonable accuracy.\r The painting measures 180.3 centimetres (71.0\u00a0in) high by 114.9 centimetres (45.2\u00a0in) wide. It depicts a busy street scene in Paris, with most of the people depicted using umbrellas against the rain. To the right, a mother looks down at her daughters, each fashionably dressed in the styles of 1881 for the afternoon promenade. She largely conceals a female figure at the centre of the frame, caught in the act of raising or lowering her umbrella, suggesting that the rain is about to start or stop. The principal female figure to the left of the frame, a milliner's assistant or modiste modelled by Renoir's lover and frequent subject Suzanne Valadon, holds up her skirt against the mud and water on the road as she carries a hatbox, but has no hat, raincoat or umbrella.\r A vigorous young bearded gentleman seems to be about to engage her, perhaps to offer her shelter under his umbrella. She, and one of the two girls to the right with a hoop and stick, look out at the viewer, while most of the other people go about their business. Unconventionally, the focus of the painting is not at its centre, and many of the figures are cut off by the frame as if the painting were a photograph. The composition appears natural, but the angles of the umbrellas are carefully arranged to form geometric shapes, with the main figure's bandbox and the girl's hoop adding rounded elements. The colours are largely blues and greys: a pattern of umbrella canopies across the top of the painting, and the dresses and coats of the people lower down.\r The pigment analysis of Renoir's The Umbrellas conducted by the scientists at the National Gallery in London confirmed the assumption that it was painted in two distinct stages as mentioned above. In the dress of the woman on the left two layers have been identified: the lower layer contains cobalt blue mixed with zinc yellow and red lake. This is a similar pigment mixture as used for the woman on the right and her two daughters. Both layers have been painted during the first phase in 1881. The upper layer of the dress of the woman on the right painted during the second stage in 1886 contains a mixture of ultramarine with other pigments with a distinctly less vivid grayish-blue color.\n", "\nArtist: Pierre-Auguste Renoir\nArtwork Name: The Large Bathers\nArtwork Genre: nude painting (nu)\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/the-large-bathers-1887\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLes Grandes Baigneuses, or The Large Bathers, is a painting by Auguste Renoir made between 1884 and 1887. The painting is in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, in Philadelphia.\r The painting depicts a scene of nude women bathing. In the foreground, two women are seated beside the water, and a third is standing in the water near them. In the background, two others are bathing. The one standing in the water in the foreground appears to be about to splash one of the women seated on the shore with water. That woman leans back to avoid the expected splash of water.\r The figures have a sculptural quality, while the landscape behind them shimmers with impressionistic light. With this new style, Renoir's intention was to reconcile the modern forms of painting with the painting traditions of the 17th and 18th centuries, particularly those of Ingres and Raphael. Renoir also admired Rubens and Titian's works, and he tried to find a compromise between the styles of these old masters and the new impressionist style.\r It is inspired at least in part by a sculpture by Fran\u00e7ois Girardon, The Bath of the Nymphs (1672), a low lead relief realized for a fountain park of Versailles. It also reflects the influence of the works of Ingres, and particularly the frescoes of Raphael, whose style he had absorbed during his trip to Italy. These two great artists influenced Renoir's entire way of painting and drawing: he began to paint in a more disciplined and more conventional manner, gave up painting outdoors, and made the female nude\u00a0\u2013 until then only an occasional subject\u2013 his main focus.\r Renoir worked on The Bathers for three years until he was content with its composition. During that time, he made numerous studies and sketches, including at least two full-sized figure drawings of the theme.\r The Bathers may also be regarded as Renoir's pictorial testament. The models for the three bathers included two of his favorites: Aline Charigot, the blonde sitting behind, whom Renoir married in 1890, and Suzanne Valadon, herself a painter and the mother of Maurice Utrillo.\r After completing The Large Bathers, Renoir received severe criticism because of his new style. Tired and disillusioned, he never again created paintings of this caliber. A similar subject later appeared in a series of paintings by Paul Cezanne.\n", "\nArtist: Pierre-Auguste Renoir\nArtwork Name: Girls at the Piano\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/girls-at-the-piano-1892\n\nWikipedia Article:\nYoung Girls at the Piano (French: Jeunes filles au piano) is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir, a leading painter in the development of the Impressionist style.

Renoir painted three other variations of this composition in oil and two sketches, one in oil and one in pastel. Known by the artist as repetitions, they were executed to fulfill commissions from dealers and collectors. The work is on public display at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris, Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie in Paris.\r Renoir depicts two young girls at a piano in a bourgeois home, one in a white dress with blue sash seated playing and one in a pink dress standing.

It is in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. Edgar Degas made some changes in the painting.\r The museum page provenance suggests the painting was possibly shown at the Fourth Impressionist Exhibition 1879 as Portrait de petite fille.\r By 1877 Cassatt had come into frank conflict with the official French art establishment and had had both her submissions for that year rejected by the Salon. So when Edgar Degas invited her to join the Impressionists the same year, a group similarly disaffected by the Salon system, she accepted with alacrity. A planned 1878 exhibition did not take place, because of what Degas judged would be competition from the World's Fair held in Paris that year, but she did hold what amounted to a show of her own at the Spring 1879 Impressionist exhibition, exhibiting a dozen oils and pastels. Exactly which works these all were is not now known with certainty, but it is likely that Little Girl in a Blue Armchair was amongst them.\r Cassatt submitted the painting to the Art Gallery of the American pavilion at the 1878 World's Fair, along with another that cannot now be identified. To her intense annoyance it was rejected, although the other was accepted. She expressed her irritation in a 1903 letter to the Parisian art dealer Ambroise Vollard, which makes it plain how much Degas had been involved (he also supplied the model, a daughter of friends of his): \"It was the portrait of a friend of M. Degas. I had done the child in the armchair and he found it good and advised me on the background and he even worked on it. I sent it to the American section of the big exposition [of 1878], they refused it ... I was furious, all the more so since he had worked on it. At that time this appeared new and the jury consisted of three people of which one was a pharmacist!\"  Indeed, the painting is often cited as an example of Degas' influence.\r Recent cleaning and infra-red photography at the National Gallery of Art has confirmed Degas' contribution.\r The painting is described as \"it dazzles with its predominant hue of deep turquoise\" and has been regarded to be a masterpiece by Karen Rosenberg in a New York Times review.\r The dog pictured lying in the armchair next the little girl's in Little Girl in a Blue Armchair is a Brussels Griffon. Cassatt was probably introduced to this breed while in Antwerp 1873. Degas presented her with a pup he had procured from fellow Impressionist Ludovic-Napol\u00e9on Lepic, a dog lover who bred them, and Cassatt went on to keep them the rest of her life. The painting was purchased from the artist by Amboise Vollard of Paris, and was later acquired by Hector Brame of Paris. It was sold in 1963 to Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon.

The Philadelphia Museum of Art acquired the painting in 1978 from the bequest of Charlotte Dorrance Wright. The style in which it was painted and the depiction of shifting light and color was influenced by Impressionism. This painting shows a view of the modern woman and is similar in style to Degas.\r This oil on canvas painting is 32 x 23 1/2 inches (81.3 x 59.7\u00a0cm). The painting shows a woman sitting on a large red chair in the balconies of the Paris Op\u00e9ra House. The figure is seated in front of a massive mirror that is reflecting the theater scene that the woman is experiencing; it is also giving us the view point that the woman is having. As with Degas, Cassatt paid close attention to the \"effects of artificial lighting on flesh tones\". The woman is sitting enjoying the sights, the city nightlife that most Impressionists were fascinated with, as she people watches. She is dressed up, as with what was expected of going to a theater, with a peach colored dress, makeup, pearls, gloves and hair pinned back. She is holding a fan and a flower is attached to the bodice of the dress. She looks bemused with what she is seeing. The quick painterly style of Impressionist paintings can be seen here as Cassatt was heavily inspired by it. The background is very gestural and loose as people are carved out in simple brush marks of color. An elaborate chandelier is also shown in the reflection of the mirror. The rich colors of the painting draw the viewer in, deep shadows create contrast against the brightness of the light source. The brush strokes within the dress itself give a texture to it and a liveliness to the piece. The view in which the viewer is given brings an intimacy to the painting, making as though the viewer is there with the woman as she enjoys her evening.\r This painting shows the modern woman because it is not showing a piece for the male gaze. This piece is more about the woman than it is about the viewer. She is shown to be enjoying herself and is neither seductive nor nude. It is depicting an average night out in Paris and humanizing women in ways that male artists had not explored. Being a genre painter she was able to reproduce scenes of everyday life, domestic settings and parties, which she would romanticize to help create an ethereal air of wonder around the women she painted.\r Besides the quick brush strokes that was indicative of Impressionist paintings, Cassatt also implemented the tipped perspective that was common in many of Degas' paintings. This caused the viewers to never be quite able to figure out where in the painting they would be standing if they were present in that scene.\r Cassatt depicted the modern woman, giving her an elegance and beauty. \"There is nothing more graciously honest and aristocratic than her portraits of young women\". \"Glamour, fashionable costume, exquisitely tasteful settings served to create an idea that was understood to be intensely modern, a pale legacy of the poet\". She painted women of the emerging middle/upper class engaged in leisure activities such as attending the theater. Because of this she is considered a Realist because of her portrayal of women in daily lives, such as working women or women of leisure. The way in which she depicted the working class woman in \"maternal solicitude or personal anxiety are framed within\" these narratives. She was also considered to be a Post-Impressionist.\n", "\nArtist: Mary Cassatt\nArtwork Name: The Boating Party\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/mary-cassatt/the-boating-party-1894\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Boating Party is an 1893 oil painting by American artist Mary Cassatt.\r It has been in the collection of the National Gallery of Art since 1963.\r Cassat painted The Boating Party during the winter of 1893\u20131894 in Antibes, on the French Riviera.\r Cassat spent January and February 1894 at the Villa \"La Cigaronne,\" in Cap d'Antibes with her mother.\r Cassat was 49 years old when she painted The Boating Party. 1893 had been a successful year for Cassatt.

Cassatt however, convinced her friend Louisine Havemeyer to buy it. Much of the work from the Havemeyer collection was bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum, but some works were left to the Havemeyer children and have since ended up elsewhere.\r Art historian and museum administrator Frederick A.

It in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Set on the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, it celebrates the victory of Eakins's friend Max Schmitt in the October 5, 1870, single sculls competition.\r Max Schmitt (1843\u20131900) had attended Philadelphia Central High School with Eakins, and the two were close friends. Schmitt was a member of the Pennsylvania Barge Club \u2013 as, it is presumed, was Eakins \u2013 one of nine men's clubs in the Schuylkill Navy, and twelve that rowed on the river. The Schuylkill Navy had been organized in 1858, with approximately 300 members, and began hosting annual regattas in 1859 (with a four-year hiatus for the American Civil War). Initially, the races were for 6-oared and 4-oared gigs and barges, but a new kind of lightweight craft was rapidly gaining popularity: the racing scull.\r Sculls, or shells, were narrower, longer, and a lot faster. Gigs had their oarlocks mounted on the sides (like a rowboat), but sculls had them a couple feet outside the boat thanks to riggers, triangular braces that projected out from the sides. This increased the efficiency of every stroke, and led to much longer oars. Meanwhile, boats got longer and hulls got narrower, until they were as narrow as was possible while still retaining sufficient buoyancy and balance.\r Schmitt was an early convert to sculls, and owned his own, named \"Josie\" after his sister. The name of the scull is visible in the painting just below Schmitt's right hand. In September 1866, the Schuylkill Navy's annual regatta first featured a single-sculls race (3 miles, 1 turn), and Schmitt won it. He won again in July 1867, but in September came in second to another Pennsylvania Barge rower in a longer (4 miles, 1 turn) race. He did not participate in 1868, when fellow Pennsylvania Barge rowers won first and second. Schmitt won the single-sculls title again in June 1869, but in September came in second to an Undine Barge Club rower.\r In 1870 the four top rowers in the Schuylkill Navy all belonged to the Pennsylvania Barge Club: Schmitt; Charles Brossman (who had won the title in 1868, and beaten Schmitt in the 4-mile race in September 1867); Austin Street (who had placed second in 1868); and John Lavens, Jr. They were the four competitors in the October championship race.\r The course was 3 miles long: beginning near Turtle Rock (Turtle Rock Light is the lighthouse at the northwest end of Boathouse Row), proceeding upriver under the Girard Avenue and Pennsylvania Railroad Connecting Bridges to a stake near the Columbia Railroad Bridge, making a 180-degree turn around the stake, and then heading downriver back to the starting line.\r Schmitt not only re-established himself as the pre-eminent rower on the Schuylkill River, he set a new record, completing the 3-mile, 1-turn course in 20:00 minutes.\r Schmitt did not defend his title the following year, and Lavens won with a time of 19:59 minutes, shaving one second off Schmitt's record. Schmitt raced one-on-one against Lavens for the single-sculls championship in 1872, and won (but did not beat Lavens's record). Schmitt sat out 1873, and Lavens won again. The two raced one-on-one again in 1874, and Schmitt won again. Having regained the championship (but not the record) and never having been defeated by Lavens, Schmitt retired from single-sculls competition. But that same year, he and Lavens joined forces to help win the Four-Oared Shell competition for the Pennsylvania Barge Club. Another Eakins painting (unfinished) may commemorate that June 17, 1874 victory.\n", "\nArtist: Thomas Eakins\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Professor Benjamin H.

It is oil on canvas and measures 8 feet (240\u00a0cm) by 6.5 feet (200\u00a0cm).\r Many art historians consider The Gross Clinic to be one of the best American paintings ever made. Dr. Samuel D. Gross, a seventy-year-old professor dressed in a black frock coat, lectures a group of Jefferson Medical College students. Included among the group is a self-portrait of Eakins, who is seen at the right-hand side of the painting, next to the tunnel railing, with a white cuffed sleeve sketching or writing. Seen over Dr. Gross's right shoulder is the clinic clerk, Dr. Franklin West, taking notes on the operation.\r Eakins's signature is painted into the painting, on the front of the surgical table.\r Admired for its uncompromising realism, The Gross Clinic has an important place documenting the history of medicine\u2014both because it honors the emergence of surgery as a healing profession (previously, surgery was associated primarily with amputation), and because it shows us what the surgical theater looked like in the nineteenth century.\r The painting is based on a surgery witnessed by Eakins, in which Gross treated a young man for osteomyelitis of the femur. Gross is pictured here performing a conservative operation as opposed to an amputation (which is how the patient would normally have been treated in previous decades).\r Here, surgeons crowd around the anesthetized patient in their frock coats. This is just prior to the adoption of a hygienic surgical environment (see asepsis). The Gross Clinic is thus often contrasted with Eakins's later painting The Agnew Clinic (1889), which depicts a cleaner, brighter, surgical theater, with the participants in \"white coats\". In comparing the two, the advancement in understanding of the prevention of infection is seen. Another noteworthy difference in the later painting is the presence of a professional nurse, Mary Clymer, in the operating theater.\r It is assumed that the patient depicted in The Gross Clinic was a teenage boy, although the exposed body is not entirely discernible as male or female; the painting is shocking for both the odd presentation of this figure and the matter-of-fact goriness of the procedure.\r Adding to the drama is the lone woman in the painting seen in the middle ground, possibly the patient's mother, cringing in distress. Her dramatic figure functions as a strong contrast to the calm, professional demeanor of the men who surround the patient. This bloody and very blunt depiction of surgery was shocking at the time it was first exhibited.\r The painting was submitted for the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, but was rejected by the Committee of Selection. When it was eventually displayed in Ward One of the U.S. Army Post Hospital, a critic for the New York Tribune wrote that it was:\r Another critic, writing in 1885, said:\r These assessments were not universal. The critic for Philadelphia's The Evening Telegraph, who may have been aware of the personal politics involved in the advisory group of artists who rejected it, wrote:\n", "\nArtist: Thomas Eakins\nArtwork Name: The Chess Player\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-eakins/the-chess-player-1876\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Chess Players is an 1876 genre painting by Thomas Eakins, Goodrich catalogue #96. It is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\r It is a small oil on wood panel depicting Eakins' father Benjamin observing a chess match. The two players are Bertrand Gardel (at left), an elderly French teacher, and the somewhat younger George Holmes, a painter. The men are in a dark, wood-panelled Victorian parlour with a quality of light suggesting late afternoon. The game is well in progress, as many pieces have been removed from the board. Holmes, the younger player, seems to be winning the match, as he has taken the queen of his opponent (the top of which pokes out of the table's drawer), and his own black queen is well-positioned in the centre of the board. Eakins painted The Chess Players for his father, and signed the painting in Latin, \"BENJAMINI. EAKINS. FILIUS. PINXIT. '76\"\u2014\"the son of Benjamin Eakins painted this\"\u2014in small letters on the drawer of the table.\r Art historian Akela Reason proposes that the painting is a tribute to a number of the artist's father-figures: Holmes probably was Eakins's first art teacher; Gardel was his French teacher; Benjamin Eakins was his literal father; and Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me, his master at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, is represented by a print of Ave Caesar Morituri te Salutant, over the clock.\r Author Martin Berger has analyzed the content of the painting in detail, finding it an evocation of the passage of time and ascribing it a highly personal meaning in Eakins' life. The younger chess player's attempt to kill the older player's king is analogous to the Oedipal complex. In the way that his father Benjamin is placed in opposition to Eakins the painter, the two may be envisioned as playing out a psychological \"conflict\" across the other axis of the chess board. In this light it is not coincidental that the painting was made on wood panel rather than canvas. While Eakins has humbled himself before his father in signing the painting only by reference to being Benjamin's son, he also presents his father ambivalently. Elevating his father's status, he places Benjamin centrally, with the vanishing point behind Benjamin's head. Yet Eakins has obscured his father's face by shadow and by the angle at which he looks down upon the game. Although the painting was dedicated to Benjamin, the title \"The Chess Players\" curiously leaves Eakins' father out of the narrative of the picture.\n", "\nArtist: Thomas Eakins\nArtwork Name: The Swimming Hole\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-eakins/the-swimming-hole\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Swimming Hole (also known as Swimming and The Old Swimming Hole) is an 1884\u201385 painting by the American artist Thomas Eakins (1844\u20131916), Goodrich catalog #190, in the collection of the Amon Carter Museum of American Art in Fort Worth, Texas. Executed in oil on canvas, it depicts six men swimming naked in a lake, and is considered a masterpiece of American painting. According to art historian Doreen Bolger it is \"perhaps Eakins' most accomplished rendition of the nude figure\", and has been called \"the most finely designed of all his outdoor pictures\". Since the Renaissance, the human body has been considered both the basis of artists' training and the most challenging subject to depict in art, and the nude was the centerpiece of Eakins' teaching program at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. For Eakins, this picture was an opportunity to display his mastery of the human form.\r In this work, Eakins took advantage of an exception to the generally prudish Victorian attitude to nudity: swimming naked was widely accepted, and for males was seen as normal, even in public spaces. Eakins was the first American artist to portray one of the few occasions in 19th-century life when nudity was on display. The Swimming Hole develops themes raised in his earlier work, in particular his treatment of buttocks and his ambiguous treatment of the human form; in some cases it is uncertain as to whether the forms portrayed are male or female. Such themes had earlier been examined in his The Gross Clinic (1875) and William Rush (1877), and would continue to be explored in his paintings of boxers (Taking the Count, Salutat, and Between Rounds) and wrestlers (Wrestlers).\r Although the theme of male bathers was familiar in Western art, having been explored by artists from Michelangelo to Daumier, Eakins' treatment was novel in American art at the time. The Swimming Hole has been \"widely cited as a prime example of homoeroticism in American art\". In 2008, the art critic Tom Lubbock described Eakins' work as:\r Eakins referred to the painting as Swimming in 1885, and as The Swimmers in 1886. The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.\r The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849\u20131928), Benjamin Fox (c.\u00a01865\u00a0\u2013 c.\u00a01900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864\u20131953), Jesse Godley (1862\u20131889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c.\u00a01880\u201390), George Reynolds (c.\u00a01839\u201389), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work\u2014no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible.

It is part of the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\r In the early 1880s, Eakins, instructor in painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, began to photograph models dressed in classical garb or nude and posed in vaguely classical poses. He used his friends and students as models, although taking nude photographs of a student was contrary to PAFA policy. Some of the photographs were used as studies for subsequent works, including those of nude young men swimming and relaxing on the shore of Dove Lake for the painting The Swimming Hole (1884-85).\r Eakins's models for Arcadia were his former student and soon-to-be wife, Susan Macdowell, his teaching assistant at PAFA, J. Laurie Wallace, and his 6-year-old nephew Ben Crowell (son of his sister Fanny). He photographed them outdoors in a number of poses, and used the photographs as studies for Arcadia and several related works.

It was commissioned to honor anatomist and surgeon David Hayes Agnew, on his retirement from teaching at the University of Pennsylvania.\r The Agnew Clinic depicts Dr. Agnew performing a partial mastectomy in a medical amphitheater. He stands in the left foreground, holding a scalpel. Also present are Dr. J. William White, applying a bandage to the patient; Dr. Joseph Leidy (nephew of paleontologist Joseph Leidy), taking the patient's pulse; and Dr. Ellwood R. Kirby, administering anesthetic. In the background, the operating room nurse, Mary Clymer, and University of Pennsylvania medical school students observe. Eakins placed himself in the painting \u2013 he is the rightmost of the pair behind the nurse \u2013 although the actual painting of him is attributed to his wife, Susan Macdowell Eakins. The painting, also, records the significant transition, in just 14 years, from the earlier status quo \u2014 the participants' black frock coats represented in The Gross Clinic (1875) \u2014 to the \"white coats\" of 1889.\r The painting is Eakins's largest work. It was commissioned for $750 (equivalent to $20,428 today) in 1889 by three undergraduate classes at the University of Pennsylvania, to honor Dr. Agnew on the occasion of his retirement. The painting was completed quickly, in three months, rather than the year that Eakins took for The Gross Clinic. Eakins carved a Latin inscription into the painting's frame. Translated, it says: \"D. Hayes Agnew M.D. Most experienced surgeon, clearest writer and teacher, most venerated and beloved man.\"\r The work is a prime example of Eakins's scientific realism. The rendering is almost photographically precise - so much so that art historians have been able to identify everyone depicted in the painting, with the exception of the patient. It largely repeats the subject of Eakins's earlier The Gross Clinic (1875), seen at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The painting echoes the subject and treatment of Rembrandt's famous Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp (1632) (in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague, the Netherlands), and other earlier depictions of public surgery such as the frontispiece of Andreas Vesalius's De humani corporis fabrica (1543), the Quack Physicians' Hall (c. 1730) by the Dutch artist Egbert van Heemskerck, and the fourth scene in William Hogarth's The Four Stages of Cruelty (1751).\r Students of the medical class of 1889 who commissioned The Agnew Clinic are portrayed as the audience for the surgery\u2014as historian Amanda Mahoney  points out, all individuals depicted in the work can be identified by name, except for the patient\u2014and this audience of male medical students creates a composition that highlights power dynamics between the masculine and the feminine in the academic medical hierarchy.

Van Buren is a ca. 1891 painting by the American artist Thomas Eakins (1844-1916), now in The Phillips Collection. It depicts Amelia Van Buren (c.\u20091856 \u2013 1942), an artist who studied with Eakins, and was called \"one of his most gifted pupils.\" The painting is considered one of Eakins's finest works.\r Van Buren studied with Eakins at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1884 and 1885. In 1886 Eakins described her as\r Eakins's helpfulness included unusual methods: he once disrobed privately for Van Buren in order to demonstrate an anatomical point, an action that he characterized as purely professional. Nevertheless, the story was one of numerous controversial incidents used by Eakins's political adversaries to prompt his dismissal from the Pennsylvania Academy.\r After she had ceased studying with Eakins, Van Buren frequently stayed as a guest in his Mount Vernon Street home, and likely posed for the painting during one of her visits to Philadelphia. Although the painting is dated c. 1891, it is also possible that the portrait could have been painted during a long stay with Eakins and his wife from December 6, 1888 to August 12, 1889. Another friend and student of Eakins's, Charles Bregler, later wrote \"I recall with pleasure looking on for several hours one afternoon while he (Eakins) was painting in this room that beautiful portrait of Miss Van Buren....No conversation took place, his attention being entirely concentrated on the painting.\"\r Van Buren eventually left painting to devote herself to photography. There exist several photographs of her that have been attributed to Eakins or his circle. She established a Boston marriage with fellow Eakins student Eva Watson.\r Van Buren's seated figure creates a pyramidal composition, activated by the movement of her head, arms, and torso. Her body is illuminated and given sculptural form by a strong shaft of light coming from the left. Her face is thin and serious, her graying hair pulled back, as she supports her head with her left hand, her right hand counterpoised in her lap, holding a fan. For Eakins's biographer John Wilmerding, the contrast between the arms is noteworthy: one arm is solid and \"architectural...suggestive of an unspoken potential for great vitality\", and \"the anchor of the portrait\" that belies the otherwise reflective countenance; the other hand is shadowed and limp. She sits in a Jacobean-revival chair, a prop that Eakins often used for his studio portraits. It is selectively detailed, so as to support without distracting from Van Buren's figure. Van Buren's dress contains complex passages, composed in part of broad, brilliant pink forms, and of creased light-colored fabric with floral patterns.\r Her body twists \"like an overused spring\", culminating in the focal point of her head, its anatomical structure exactingly rendered, the broad forehead suggesting the sitter's intellectual presence. She exhibits what one reviewer had already referred to as \"an Eakinsish expression\", characteristic of his ability to portray \"mere thinking without the aid of gesture or attitude.\" In a letter from his youth, Eakins explained his interest in the:\n", "\nArtist: Thomas Eakins\nArtwork Name: The Concert Singer\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-eakins/the-concert-singer-1892\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Concert Singer is a painting by Thomas Eakins (1844\u20131916), depicting the singer Weda Cook (1867\u20131937). The work, commenced in 1890 and completed in 1892, was Eakins's first full-length portrait of a woman. It is now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\r The Concert Singer was one of a series of portraits Eakins painted of Philadelphia natives who were prominent in science and culture, with the intent of producing major showpieces for exhibition. The painting exemplifies Eakins's desire to truthfully record visual appearances with \"historical value.\"\r Eakins drew, painted, or sculpted at least twenty-two works that dealt with the visual aspects of music; at one point, this included \"eleven straight portraits of musicians and musicologists\", of which The Concert Singer has been called \"the finest\".\r The work depicts Weda Cook, a \"respected Camden vocalist... recognized for her 'powerful contralto voice, unassuming manner, and thorough training.'\" She stands center stage, wearing pink slippers and a low-necked sleeveless pink dress, a luminous and central element in the picture, fringed with lace and pearl beads. Eakins's realism is notable in the painting of skin tones, with Cook's bare neck, chest, arms, and shoulders visibly paler than her head and hands. The figure is solidly and subtly modeled, its warm light pinks set against a cooler and darker yellow-green background. Narrative details are minimal. In the lower-left foreground, a conductor's hand and baton are visible, although the rest of the figure is not pictured. Initially, as can be seen in the preliminary sketch, the hand grasped the baton as if it were a paint brush. For verisimilitude Eakins had Charles M. Schmitz, the conductor of the Germania Orchestra and Cook's teacher, pose holding the baton. A bouquet at the lower right suggests that the singer is performing an encore; apparently a fresh supply of roses was provided at each sitting by the sculptor William Rudolf O'Donovan, who had fallen in love with Cook.\r The floor on which Cook stands recedes into an ambiguous background, and despite several anecdotal elements, the painting is \"remarkably barren\", though with enough information to suggest a public performance. Inconsistencies in perspective add to the ambiguity. The lower part of the dress, shoes, and flowers are depicted as if seen from above, yet the visibility of the soles of the shoes and underside of the dress suggest a lower vantage point.\r The austerity of the composition marks a new and more abstract tendency in Eakins's work, presaging the increasing sense of isolation that would be characteristic of his later portraits. In its design, cropping of details at the lower edges, and low angle of vision, John Wilmerding has likened the painting to the music and dance interiors of Eakins's contemporary, Edgar Degas. Despite formal similarities between The Concert Singer and works by Eakins's French contemporaries, there is a difference in mood: Degas' singers work in cafes, their glamor undercut by garish lighting, and Daumier's essays of the theme are more cynical still. In contrast, the Eakins painting reflects an American appreciation for singing as a manifestation of high culture. Unidealized, Weda Cook's figure is depicted as substantial and sensuous. It is revealed by a light that creates form, depth, and produces \"the painting's profoundly poetic mood\".\n", "\nArtist: Thomas Eakins\nArtwork Name: Salutat\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-eakins/salutat-1898\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSalutat is an 1898 painting by Thomas Eakins (1844\u20131916). Based on a real-life boxing match that occurred in 1898, the work depicts a boxer waving to the crowd after the match. According to Eakins' biographer Lloyd Goodrich, Salutat is \"one of Eakins' finest achievements in figure-painting.\" The painting's title is Latin for \"He greets\" or \"He salutes.\"\r Much as he had with his paintings of rowers in the 1870s, during the late 1890s Eakins turned his interest again to the male nude, this time depicting prizefighters. Eakins attended fights in 1898, and aided by sportswriters Clarence Cranmer and Henry Walter Schlichter, met with and hired fighters to pose for him.\r The studio became a place to spar; according to Eakins's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 the sculptor Samuel Murray, (who in 1899 made a bronze statue of Billy Smith) one of the fighters, Ellwood McCloskey, would \"round up fellow pugilists who had promised to pose but didn't show up\":\r \"Turkey Point\" Billy Smith, a featherweight who competed in over 100 bouts over the course of ten years and fought two featherweight champions, was the protagonist for Salutat as well as for Between Rounds.\r Eakins made multiple studies of the subject. A pencil-on-paper study was purchased by Joseph Hirshhorn in 1965 and donated to his eponymous museum in 1966.\r Eakins also completed an oil-on-canvas study, which he gave to art critic Sadakichi Hartmann after Hartmann praised Eakins in his 1901 book A History of American Art. (This was the first time Eakins had been recognized as being of historic importance.) This study is now in the possession of the Carnegie Museum of Art.\r Salutat, Between Rounds (a portion of which was executed separately as Billy Smith) and Taking the Count are a series of three large boxing paintings done by Eakins. The former two depict events surrounding a boxing match that took place on April 22, 1898. Featherweight Tim Callahan fought featherweight Billy Smith in a match that was close until the final round, when Callahan gained the advantage and won the fight. However, for Salutat, Eakins chose to depict Smith as the winner. In the work, Smith raises his hand to salute the audience, in the style of a Gladiator. On the painting's original frame Eakins carved the words \"DEXTRA VICTRICE CONCLAMANTES SALVTAT\" (With the victorious right hand, he salutes those shouting [their approval]).\r As with a number of other Eakins works, the rendering of the figures is extremely precise, such that it has allowed art historians to identify individual members of the audience. While working on the boxing pictures, friends would visit the studio, and Eakins invited them to \"stay a while and I'll put you in the picture.\" For Salutat, audience members include Eakins's friend Louis Kenton (wearing eyeglasses and a bow tie), sportswriter Clarence Cranmer (wearing a bowler hat), David Jordan (brother of Letitia Wilson Jordan, whom Eakins painted in Portrait of Letitia Wilson Jordan), photographer Louis Husson (next to Jordan), Eakins's student Samuel Murray, and Eakins's father Benjamin Eakins.\r Smith is bathed in soft white light, which illuminates his muscles. Amid a general tonality of warm grays and browns that contains no strong chromatic notes, the skin tones of the three main figures are pale. All three men have the quality of relief sculpture, and with Smith's figure separate from those of his seconds, they appear to move across the canvas in an arrangement reminiscent of a frieze.\n", "\nArtist: Thomas Eakins\nArtwork Name: The Wrestlers\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-eakins/the-wrestlers-1899\n\nWikipedia Article:\nWrestlers is a name shared by three closely related 1899 paintings by American artist Thomas Eakins, (Goodrich catalog #317, #318, #319).

I wish you could find it convenient to be at the studio and help us with advice as to positions and so forth.\" The artist's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Samuel Murray may have been present; he modeled a small sculpture of the wrestlers that is also dated 1899. Eakins painted the works from the live models and from a nearly identical photograph, that may have been taken that day. The photograph shows the wrestler on top holding the other in a half nelson and crotch hold.\r PMA's unfinished version (G-319) was painted before the finished painting (G-317), and is thought to be an abandoned composition rather than a study. LACMA's finished painting (G-317) is larger, and features a well-defined setting with additional figures in the background. LACMA's oil sketch (G-318) varies from the other paintings in the position of the head and shoulders of the wrestler on top.\r Author Allen Guttmann has compared Eakins' Wrestlers to George Luks' The Wrestlers (1905) and Max Slevogt's Wrestling School (1893), writing that all three paintings depict pairs of nude wrestling men lying on the ground in grappling holds.\r Eakins donated the finished version of Wrestlers to the National Academy of Design (NAD) as a \"reception piece,\" when he was elected to membership in early 1902. Later that year, he painted a self-portrait and donated it to NAD when he was elected an Academician. NAD deaccessioned the finished version in 1968, and sold it in 1970 to the Columbus Museum of Art. It was part of that museum's permanent collection until 2005, when it was deaccessioned to raise funds for the purchase of the Philip J. and Suzanne Schiller collection of American art. Philanthropist Cecile Bartman funded LACMA's 2006 purchase of the finished painting, so it and its sketch would be reunited.\r Eakins died in 1916, and a collection of his unsold paintings was exhibited at the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia. PMA Director Fiske Kimball saw the abandoned version of Wrestlers at the world's fair, and inquired about buying it. According to Kimball, Cranmer (who was acting as the dealer for Eakins's widow) said the abandoned version had been valued low, and had not been included in the Eakins memorial exhibitions of a decade earlier. \"He [Cranmer] said he would find out the price. It was $400. I bought it and by Christmas 1926 it was hanging in the library at Lemon Hill.\" Letters from Cranmer to Kimball in the PMA Archives identify the wrestler on top as Joseph McCann, but do not identify the man on the bottom. Kimball died in 1955, and made the abandoned version a bequest to his museum.\n", "\nArtist: Gustave Caillebotte\nArtwork Name: Man at the Window\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/man-at-the-window-1875\n\nWikipedia Article:\nYoung Man at His Window (French: Jeune homme \u00e0 sa fen\u00eatre) is a painting of 1875 by the French Impressionist Gustave Caillebotte (1848\u20131894). The oil on canvas painting measures 117 by 82 centimetres (46\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a032\u00a0in).\r The painting depicts the artist's brother, Ren\u00e9 Caillebotte, wearing informal clothes and standing at a balcony. He is standing at a window from the family home in the Rue de Miromesnil in Paris, looking outwards into Boulevard de Malesherbes (the large, oblique cross-street in the background). It is a comparatively early work in Caillebotte's oeuvre and reveals his interest in urban Realism.\r In its theme of a figure seen from behind at an open window, the composition has precedents in German Romanticism, a notable example being Caspar David Friedrich's Woman at the Window (1822). Other examples include Goethe at the Window of His Room in Rome (1787) by Johann Heinrich Tischbein and The Morning Hour (1857\u201360) by Moritz von Schwind.\r Caillebotte's painting differs from his German antecedents in several ways, however. The man does not gaze upon nature, but rather looks out upon an urban scene. According to the art historian Kirk Varnedoe, \"a standard charm of the window view is our bemused curiosity as to what the observer is looking at; but Caillebotte's structure replaces this curiosity with something quite different.\" By placing the onlooking man off-center and depicting him from a somewhat elevated viewpoint, Caillebotte's painting creates a tense relationship between the dominant foreground figure, the emphatic perspectival diagonals, and the detailed street scene beyond. Varnedoe says \"the normal interior-exterior oppositions of the window are thus combined in a charged relationship, competitive or covalent, that is seemingly unprecedented\".\r Caillebotte presented this painting at the Impressionism exhibition of 1876 alongside a few of his other works, including Les raboteurs de parquet. Writer \u00c9mile Zola was impressed with technical achievement of the works, but was not enthusiastic about the style: \"Photography of reality which is not stamped with the original seal of the painter's talent\u2014that's a pitiful thing.\" He called the painting \"anti-artistic... because of the exactitude of the copying.\"\n", "\nArtist: Gustave Caillebotte\nArtwork Name: The Parquet Planers (The Floor Scrapers)\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/the-parquet-planers-1875\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLes raboteurs de parquet (English title: The Floor Scrapers) is an oil painting by French Impressionist Gustave Caillebotte. The canvas measures 102 by 146.5 centimetres (40.2\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a057.7\u00a0in). It was originally given by Caillebotte's family in 1894 to the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg, then transferred to the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in 1929. In 1947, it was moved to the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume, and in 1986, it was transferred again to the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris, where it is currently displayed.\r Caillebotte\u2019s originality lay in his attempt to combine the careful drawing, modeling and exact tonal values encouraged by the Acad\u00e9mie with vivid colors, bold perspectives, keen sense of natural light and modern subject matter of the Impressionist movement. Painted in 1875, this work illustrates Caillebotte's continued interest in perspective and everyday life. In the scene, the observer stands above three workers on hands and knees, scraping a wooden floor in a bourgeois apartment\u2014now believed to be Caillebotte's own studio at 77, rue de Miromesnil, in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. A window on the back wall admits natural light. The workers are all shown with nude torsos and tilted heads, suggesting a conversation. Caillebotte\u2019s interest in the male nude, set in a modern context, has been linked to his presumed homosexuality. It must be noted, however, that it was part of a larger trend, not necessarily limited to homosexual artists, that was first introduced by Courbet in a painting of two wrestlers (Sz\u00e9pm\u00fcv\u00e9zeti Museum, Budapest). This is one of the first paintings to feature the urban working class. It reintroduces the subject of the male nude in the painting, but in a strikingly updated form. Instead of the heroes of antiquity, here are the heroes of modern life\u2014sinewy and strong\u2014in stooped poses that would appear demeaning if they did not convey a sense of masculine strength and honest labor. There is a motif of curls in the image, from the wood shavings on the floor, to the pattern of ironwork in the window grill to the arched backs and arms of the workers. The repetition in the image, with the three workers engaged in different aspects of the same activity but having similar poses, is similar to works by Caillebotte's contemporary, Edgar Degas.\r Despite the effort Caillebotte put into the painting, it was rejected by France's most prestigious art exhibition, the Salon, in 1875. The depiction of working-class people in their trade, not fully clothed, shocked the jurors and was deemed a \"vulgar subject matter\". He was hurt by this rejection, and instead showed it at the second exhibition of the Impressionists, with whom he had already associated himself, in 1876. He presented it alongside some of his other works, including a second, different version of Raboteurs from 1876, and his earlier work Jeune homme \u00e0 sa fen\u00eatre (Young Man at His Window) The images of the floor scrapers came to be associated with Degas's paintings of washerwomen, also presented at the same exhibition and similarly scorned as \"vulgar\".\n", "\nArtist: Gustave Caillebotte\nArtwork Name: Paris, a Rainy Day\nArtwork Genre: sketch and study\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/paris-a-rainy-day\n\nWikipedia Article:\nParis Street; Rainy Day (French Rue de Paris, temps de pluie) is a large 1877 oil painting by the French artist Gustave Caillebotte (1848\u20131894), and is his best known work. It shows a number of individuals walking through the Place de Dublin, in 1877 known as the Carrefour de Moscou, at an intersection to the east of the Gare Saint-Lazare in north Paris. Although Caillebotte was a friend and patron of many of the impressionist painters, and this work is part of that school, it differs in its realism and reliance on line rather than broad brush strokes.\r Caillebotte's interest in photography is evident. The figures in the foreground appear \"out of focus\", those in the mid-distance (the carriage and the pedestrians in the intersection) have sharp edges, while the features in the background become progressively indistinct. The severe cropping of some figures \u2013 particularly the man to the far right \u2013 further suggests the influence.\r The first showing of the painting was at the Third Impressionist Exhibition of 1877. It currently is owned by the Art Institute of Chicago. AIC curator Gloria Groom described the work as \"the great picture of urban life in the late 19th century.\"\r The tone of the light indicates that the painting is set on a wintery afternoon, and the two main figures walk underneath an umbrella. They are dressed in the height of contemporary Parisian fashion. She wears a hat, veil, diamond earring, demure brown dress, and a fur lined coat, described in 1877 as \"modern \u2013 or should I say, the latest fashion\". The man wears a moustache, topcoat, frock coat, top hat, bow tie, starched white shirt, buttoned waistcoat and an open long coat with collar turned up. They are unambiguously middle class, yet some working class figures may be seen in the background; a maid in a doorway, the decorator carrying a ladder, cut-off by the umbrella above him. Caillebotte juxtaposes the figures and the perspective in a playful manner, with one man appearing to jump from the wheel of a carriage; another pair of legs appear below the rim of an umbrella.\r The painting does not present a convivial mood. The figures seem mostly isolated, and their expressions are largely downcast. They appear to hurry rather than stroll through the streets, absorbed in their own thoughts. The umbrellas shield them, in the words of Rose-Marie Hagen, \"not just from the rain, but, also it seems, from other passers by\". Characteristic of the positioning of the figures, the heads and eyes of the main couple are faced away from the man approaching them from their right. Hagen believes that given their close quarters, they will both be unable to comfortably step out of the man's way, but also their averted gaze applies equally to the viewer, who looks from a perspective equal to us. Caillebotte reproduces the effect of a camera lens in that the points at the center of the image seem to bulge. He also recreates the focusing effect of the camera in the way that it sharpens certain subjects of an image, but not others. The same purpose is seen in the overall clarity of the image. The foreground is in focus, but slightly smudged; the middle ground has sharp, clear edges and well defined subjects, and the background fades into the distance, becoming more and more blurry the farther back the eye travels. He makes the middle ground section more clear, mimicking the effect of a camera.\n", "\nArtist: Gustave Caillebotte\nArtwork Name: A Balcony in Paris\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/a-balcony-in-paris-1881\n\nWikipedia Article:\nA Balcony in Paris (French: Un balcon \u00e0 Paris) is an oil on canvas painting by the French Impressionist painter Gustave Caillebotte.

The motif may have been inspired by similar juxtapositions seen in many Japanese ukiyo-e prints.\n", "\nArtist: Gustave Caillebotte\nArtwork Name: Le Pont de L'Europe\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/le-pont-de-l-europe\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLe Pont de l'Europe (English title: The Europe Bridge) is an oil painting by French impressionist Gustave Caillebotte completed in 1876. It is held by the Mus\u00e9e du Petit Palais in Geneva, Switzerland. The finished canvas measures 125 by 181 centimetres (49\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a071\u00a0in).\r The image shows pedestrians in the Place de l'Europe in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. The plaza is a large bridge joining six avenues, each named for a European capital, over the railroad yards at Gare Saint-Lazare. The view is from the rue de Vienne, looking towards the center of the plaza. One of the bridge's trusses is very prominent, visible in half of the image.\r Three individuals are seen in the foreground: a couple walking toward the observer, and a working-class man peering off the bridge toward the train station. A dog walks away from the observer, and other individuals appear in the mid-background. The man of the couple is a fl\u00e2neur, an upper-class street observer. He is strolling with a woman dressed in black. She has often been interpreted to be a prostitute, according to contemporary social norms regarding women in public, especially in the area of the train station. Alternatively, the man has been thought to be Caillebotte himself, and the woman to be Caillebotte's companion, Anne-Marie Hagen. The fl\u00e2neur is looking past his companion in the direction of the other man. Feminist art historian Norma Broude has suggested that Caillebotte, a lifelong bachelor, is signalling his own homosexuality with this gaze. In this reading, Caillebotte is an upper-class man cruising for a lower-class male prostitute in this unsavory neighborhood of Paris. However, Caillebotte's sexual orientation is not definitively known.\r Caillebotte displayed this image at the impressionist exhibition of 1877, alongside his Rue de Paris, temps de pluie and Claude Monet's Le Pont de l'Europe, Gare Saint-Lazare, which gives an alternate view of the bridge.\r Caillebotte, as in many of his works, employs perspective. The vanishing point is located behind the head of the man, which is far to the side of the picture, creating oblique perspective. Caillebotte was influenced by Japanese art, especially the work of Hiroshige, and by photography, then a burgeoning artistic field. In turn, this painted composition may have been an influence in photographer Jeff Wall's work from 1982, Mimic, which features similar exaggerated perspective and class tension between the three similarly situated characters.\r Caillebotte\u2019s The Europe Bridge shows how obeying the rules of society can work: the social classes indeed coexist, they meet each other on the streets, but they do not correlate. Hausmann\u2019s spacious boulevards allow such state of things. Paris won\u2019t ever come back to its Medieval past. \n", "\nArtist: Abbott Handerson Thayer\nArtwork Name: The Sisters\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/abbott-handerson-thayer/the-sisters-1884\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Sisters is an 1884 oil on canvas painting by Abbott Handerson Thayer. It depicts Bessie and Clara Stillman, and was commissioned from Thayer by their brother, the banker James Stillman. It has been cited as one of Thayer's best works, a composition of grandeur.\r After studying in New York City and Paris, Thayer took a studio in Brooklyn in 1880, and traveled often, summering for the next few years in Nantucket or Pittsfield, Massachusetts; in 1881 he went to Hartford, Connecticut to paint Mark Twain, and in 1882 he spent the winter in a cottage owned by Henry Ward Beecher in Peekskill, New York. In 1883 Thayer rented a home at Cornwell-on-Hudson, and built a studio on James Stillman's property. It was there that he painted two portraits of the sisters, one of Bessie alone, completed in 1883, and the double portrait, which he worked on until January 1884. Together, the paintings are quite different from his previous portraits, which had featured more opulent wardrobes in keeping with the fashionable style of the Paris Salon\u2014 an art reviewer had found fault with the \"poor taste\" of the glamorous finery of Thayer's 1881 Portrait of Mrs. William F. Milton, and thereafter the artist avoided ostentatious dress.\r Thayer began The Sisters in the summer of 1883. It was at that time the largest portrait he had attempted, and the composition was arrived upon only after much trial and error. Thayer wrote:\r and later\r Dressed in black and set against a muted green background, the sisters are seen in a doorway. Bessie stands in front, her arms down and hands clasped in front of her. Clara stands directly behind, and wraps her left hand around Bessie's waist while resting her upraised right hand on the entryway's frame. The sisters are noble in comportment and remote in expression. The unusual positioning of their figures implies a complex and intimate relationship.\r Though the overall impression is successful, the painting has been faulted for lapses in execution. The drawing of Bessie's right forearm is meager, Clara's left hand is weak, and the brushwork throughout is labored. Commissioned portraits were expected to be more highly finished, and although The Sisters was given a place of honor at the Society of American Artists exhibition of 1884, it received harsh criticism for the perceived \"flimsiness\" of its details. Technical faults notwithstanding, the nobility of its composition has been compared to the portraits of Thomas Eakins.\r For their elegance and restrained tones, Thayer's portraits of the mid-1880s, and particularly The Sisters, have been cited as influential to the work of his younger colleague Dennis Miller Bunker.\n", "\nArtist: Georges Seurat\nArtwork Name: Bathers at Asni\u00e8res\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-seurat/bathers-at-asni-res-1884\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBathers at Asni\u00e8res (French: Une Baignade, Asni\u00e8res) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the French artist Georges Pierre Seurat, the first of his two masterpieces on the monumental scale. The canvas is of a suburban, but placed Parisian riverside scene. Isolated figures, with their clothes piled sculpturally on the riverbank, together with trees, austere boundary walls and buildings, and the River Seine are presented in a formal layout. A combination of complex brushstroke techniques, and a meticulous application of contemporary colour theory bring to the composition a sense of gentle vibrancy and timelessness.\r Seurat completed the painting of Bathers at Asni\u00e8res in 1884, when he was twenty-four years old. He applied to the jury of the Salon of the same year to have the work exhibited there, but the jury rejected it. The Bathers continued to puzzle many of Seurat\u2019s contemporaries, and the picture was not widely acclaimed until many years after the death of the artist at the age of just thirty-one. An appreciation of the painting\u2019s merits grew during the twentieth century, and today it hangs in the National Gallery, London, where it is considered one of the highlights of the gallery\u2019s collection of paintings.\r The spot depicted is just short of four miles from the centre of Paris. It is in fact the case that the figures on the river-bank are not in the commune of Asni\u00e8res, but are rather in Courbevoie, the commune bordering Asni\u00e8res to the west. The bathers themselves are in the River Seine. The slope forming most of the left hand side of the painting was known as the C\u00f4te des Ajoux, near the end of the rue des Ajoux, on the north bank of the river. Opposite is the island of la Grande Jatte, the east tip of which is shown as the slope and the trees to the right, and which Seurat has pictorially extended beyond its actual length. The Asni\u00e8res railway bridge, and the industrial buildings of Clichy are in the background. Locations such as this one were sometimes shown on French nineteenth century maps as Baignade (or, \u2018bathing area\u2019).\r Many artists painted canvases from this stretch of the Seine during the 1880s. As well as the Bathers, some of Seurat\u2019s better known works to come from the vicinity include his The Seine at Courbevoie, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, and The Bridge at Courbevoie.\r Seurat uses a variety of means to suggest the baking heat of a summer\u2019s day at the riverside. A hot haze softens the edges of the trees in the middle-distance and washes out colour from the bridges and factories in the background\u2014the blue of the sky at the horizon is paled almost to whiteness. A shimmering appearance at the surface of Bathers at Asni\u00e8res subtly reinforces this saturating heat and sunlight. Writing about these effects, the art historian Roger Fry reported his view that, \u201cno one could render this enveloping with a more exquisitely tremulous sensibility, a more penetrating observation or more unfailing consistency, than Seurat\u201d.\n", "\nArtist: Georges Seurat\nArtwork Name: Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-seurat/sunday-afternoon-on-the-island-of-la-grande-jatte-1886\n\nWikipedia Article:\nA Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (French: Un dimanche apr\u00e8s-midi \u00e0 l'\u00cele de la Grande Jatte) painted in 1884, is one of Georges Seurat's most famous works. It is a leading example of pointillist technique, executed on a large canvas. Seurat's composition includes a number of Parisians at a park on the banks of the River Seine.\r In 1879 Georges Seurat enlisted as a soldier in the French army and was back home by 1880. Later, he ran a small painter\u2019s studio in Paris, and in 1883 showed his work publicly for the first time. The following year, Seurat began to work on La Grande Jatte and exhibited the painting in the spring of 1886 with the Impressionists. With La Grande Jatte, Seurat was immediately acknowledged as the leader of a new and rebellious form of Impressionism called Neo-Impressionism.\r Seurat painted A Sunday Afternoon between May 1884 and March 1885, and from October 1885 to May 1886, focusing meticulously on the landscape of the park. He reworked the original and completed numerous preliminary drawings and oil sketches. He sat in the park, creating numerous sketches of the various figures in order to perfect their form. He concentrated on issues of colour, light, and form. The painting is approximately 2 by 3 meters (7 by 10 feet) in size.\r Inspired by optical effects and perception inherent in the color theories of Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, Ogden Rood and others, Seurat adapted this scientific research to his painting. Seurat contrasted miniature dots or small brushstrokes of colors that when unified optically in the human eye were perceived as a single shade or hue. He believed that this form of painting, called divisionism at the time but now known as pointillism, would make the colors more brilliant and powerful than standard brushstrokes. The use of dots of almost uniform size came in the second year of his work on the painting, 1885\u201386. To make the experience of the painting even more vivid, he surrounded it with a frame of painted dots, which in turn he enclosed with a pure white, wooden frame, which is how the painting is exhibited today at the Art Institute of Chicago.\r The Island of la Grande Jatte is located at the very gates of Paris, lying in the Seine between Neuilly and Levallois-Perret, a short distance from where La D\u00e9fense business district currently stands. Although for many years it was an industrial site, it is today the site of a public garden and a housing development. When Seurat began the painting in 1884, the island was a bucolic retreat far from the urban center.\r The painting was first exhibited at the eighth Impressionist exhibition in May 1886, then in August 1886, dominating the second Salon of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Ind\u00e9pendants, of which Seurat had been a founder in 1884. Seurat was extremely disciplined, always serious, and private to the point of secretiveness\u2014for the most part, steering his own steady course. As a painter, he wanted to make a difference in the history of art and with La Grand Jatte, succeeded.\n", "\nArtist: Georges Seurat\nArtwork Name: Circus Sideshow\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-seurat/circus-sideshow-1888\n\nWikipedia Article:\nParade de cirque (English: Circus Sideshow) is a 1887-88 Neo-Impressionist painting by Georges Seurat. It was first exhibited at the 1888 Salon de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Ind\u00e9pendants (titled Parade de cirque, cat. no. 614) in Paris, where it became one of Seurat's least admired works. Parade de cirque represents the sideshow (or parade) of the Circus Corvi at place de la Nation, and was his first depiction of a nocturnal scene, and first painting of popular entertainment. Seurat worked on the theme for nearly six years before completing the final painting.\r Art historian Alfred H. Barr Jr. described Parade de cirque as one of Seurat's most important paintings, its 'formality' and 'symmetry' as highly innovative, and placed it as \"the most geometric in design as well as the most mysterious in sentiment\" of Seurat's major canvases.\r Circus Sideshow influenced the Fauves, Cubists, Futurists and Orphists. It is located at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (Bequest of Stephen C. Clark, 1960, accession number: 61.101.17, Gallery 826).\r Circus Sideshow is a large oil painting on canvas measuring 99.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0149.9 centimetres (39.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a059.0\u00a0in). Painted in the Divisionist style, the work employs pointillist dots of color (primarily violet-gray, blue-gray, orange, and green) and a play of lines governed by rules whose laws Seurat had studied. It depicts immobile figures outdoors under artificial lighting at the sideshow of the Circus Corvi at place de la Nation, a working-class quarter in eastern Paris. A row of cornet and trombone players in solemn formation are seen under the unreal evening lights of a parade. The work is dominated by a monotony of horizontal and vertical lines, suggesting the rhythms of Egyptian reliefs and frescoes. Though rather than indicating distance as Egyptian art (by changing scale), or classically (by foreshortening), Seurat establishes the position of his subjects through lighting. Those in the foreground are unlit, painted in dark blue, while those behind the gas jets are brilliantly lit.\r Seurat's view of this scene is so radically flattened that it is difficult to identify the composition's multiple levels. The golden section appears to govern its geometric structure, though modern consensus among art historians is that Seurat never used this divine proportion in his work.\r The final study of Parade, executed prior to the oil on canvas, is divided horizontally into fourths and vertically into sixths. The 4\u00a0: 6 ratio corresponds to the dimensions of the canvas, which is one and one-half times wider than its vertical dimension. An additional vertical axes was drawn by Seurat, which neither corresponds to the location of the figures, nor to the architectural construction of the work; neither do these axes correspond precisely to the golden section, 1\u00a0: 1.6, as might have been expected. Rather, they correspond to basic mathematical divisions (simple ratios that appear to approximate the golden section), as noted by Seurat with citations from Charles Henry.\r The entrance of the circus tent consists of ticket window and doors at the center of a platform atop six steps. On both sides of the doors (here painted green), musicians and acrobats perform a sideshow on the balustraded platform to entice passersby. Those interested in purchasing tickets from the ticket seller\u2014the man and woman toward the bottom right of the painting\u2014climb the central stairs. Ticket holders queue parallel to the sideshow stage. The diagonal line behind the trombonist is the handrail for the subsidiary stairs. A woman with a young girl is buying a ticket on the platform to the right of the ringmaster. Just as the musicians toward the left, they are immersed in the orange glow of nine gas jets (each possessing a perceptible blue-violet aura) that illuminate the platform. Five yellow-white globes of interior lamps are visible through the ticket windows. The conspicuous tree to the left bares the presence of a human figure.\n", "\nArtist: Georges Seurat\nArtwork Name: Chahut\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-seurat/chahut-1890\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLe Chahut (English: The Can-can) is a Neo-Impressionist painting by Georges Seurat, dated 1889-90.

The work is dominated by a color scheme that tends toward the red end of the spectrum, of earth tones that draw from a palette of browns, tans, warm grays, and blues, interspersed with not just the primary colors (reds and yellows), nor even with the six principal colors, but with eighteen mixtures on his palette prior to application on the canvas (any of which could be mixed with white). A deeper blue border painted around the edge of the canvas culminates in a shallow arch on the upper edge.\r Le Chahut is a conspicuous example of Seurat\u2019s pointillist technique. The modulation of light and shadow throughout the work is obtained by the use of small dots of color juxtaposed side by side while alternating in both intensity and concentrations. The dots are meant to fuse in the eye of the viewer to create the impression of mixed colors when observed from a distance. While the Impressionists had focused their attention on the harmony of colors based on similar or related hues (only partially separated), the Neo-Impressionists harmony had been based on contrasting hues, pitted one against the other; resulting in a vibrating m\u00e9lange optique (the optical mixture in the observer's eye).\r The painting is divided into three principal spaces. Musicians occupy the lower left section, one of whom is centrally located, his back turned toward the viewer, with his double-bass erected to the left. A row of dancers, two women and two men with their legs raised, occupy the upper right. They are characterized by curves and rhythmic repetition, creating a synthetic sense of dynamical movement. The background consists of ornate cabaret-style lighting fixtures, and a few members of the audience sitting in the front row, their eyes fixed on the performance. On the lower right another client is staring with a sidelong glance, indicative of sexual desire or sly and malicious intent; the archetype of a male voyeur, often portrayed in mid-century journalistic illustrations of the can-can.\r Chahut (literally meaning noise or uproar) is an alternative name for the can-can, a provocative, sexually charged dance that first appeared in the ballrooms of Paris around 1830. The style of dance caused a scandal due to the high kicks and other gestures of the arms and legs. Leading up to the 1890s, the dance transited from individuals in ballrooms to stage performances by a chorus line in such places as the Moulin Rouge in Montmartre.\n", "\nArtist: Georges Seurat\nArtwork Name: The Channel of Gravelines, Petit Fort Philippe\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-seurat/the-channel-of-gravelines-petit-fort-philippe-1890\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Channel of Gravelines, Petit Fort Philippe is a pointillist painting by French artist Georges Seurat, located in the Indianapolis Museum of Art in Indianapolis, Indiana. Painted in 1890, the year before his death, it depicts a harbor in the small French port of Gravelines. Described as \"wistful and poetic,\" it is one of the treasures of the IMA.\r As one of Seurat's final paintings, The Channel of Gravelines, Petit Fort Philippe demonstrates beautifully the principles of Seurat's own Neo-Impressionist movement. His systematic application of dots in colors carefully chosen according to laws of chromatic harmony results in unparalleled luminosity. Seurat painted a narrow border of darker dots around the edge of the canvas, heightening the brilliance of the light. The frame (a reproduction of Seurat's original design) with its vivid ultramarine base and dots echoing the adjacent canvas, enhances the colors still further. In addition to his careful control of the dots' color, Seurat also used their shape and density to achieve his vision. The extremely solid central bollard has the greatest density of dots, while the right side of the sky is so loosely covered that the white ground layer is visible. Based upon the bright light and stark shadows, Seurat painted in midafternoon.\r Although Seurat was quite faithful to the actual architecture of the harbor, to the extent that much of it is recognizable to this day, he arrayed the boats so their horizontal and vertical elements resulted in maximum visual stability. The elegant parabola of the wharf induces serenity. Stretching into infinity, it evokes the immensity of the sea. Simultaneously, the sweeping diagonal cutting the composition in two provides contrasting movement.\r Seurat's quest for aesthetic perfection can be seen in the number of alterations he made between his initial studies and the final painting. The central bollard anchors the composition securely, so solid as to be nearly graspable, but was missing from the panel study. Comparing the final canvas to the rest of his studies reveals that, in addition to arranging the boats in a neat, calm horizontal line, Seurat also tweaked the walkway to give the channel a greater role in the composition. Thus, sea, sky, and ground occupy roughly equal proportions.\r While he spent most of the year shocking Paris with his novel style and views, Seurat spent his summers painting wistful seascapes. In 1890, he traveled to the tiny port of Gravelines, near the Belgian border, and painted what would be his last four landscapes. That was two fewer paintings than he had produced the summer previous, perhaps because the broad coastal plain, marked only by dunes, was markedly different from his usual Normandy settings. The rise of the summer vacation meant artists found a ready market for seaside images. Unlike older artists such as Monet, though, Seurat preferred utterly prosaic images of ports and shores, rather than more dramatic sunsets and stormy seas. The complete lack of humans, either vacationers or hardworking fishermen, was typical of Seurat's seascapes, which always had a luminous stillness.\r Seurat's choice of Gravelines was somewhat unusual, given that contemporary guidebooks described it as \"an uninteresting town.\" Its very obscurity may have been a draw for the artist, who was growing protective of his methods. Also, its canal's straight lines lent themselves well to the strictly-organized compositions Seurat preferred.\n", "\nArtist: Georges Seurat\nArtwork Name: Young Woman Powdering Herself\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-seurat/young-woman-powdering-herself-1890\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJeune femme se poudrant (Young Woman Powdering Herself) is a circa 1889-90 painting by French painter Georges Seurat.

It was his last painting, made in a Neo-Impressionist style in 1890-91, and remained unfinished at his death in March 1891. The painting is located at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris.\r The painting was Seurat's third major work treating the theme of the circus, after his Parade (Circus sideshow) of 1887-88 and Le Chahut of 1889-90. It depicts a female performer standing on a horse at the Circus Fernando (renamed the Circus M\u00e9drano in 1890, after its most famous clown). The Circus M\u00e9drano was located at the corner of the Rue des Martyrs and the Boulevard de Rochechouart, close to Seurat's studio. It was a popular entertainment in Paris, depicted in the 1880s by other artists such as Renoir (for example, Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg)), Degas (for example, Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando) and Toulouse-Lautrec (for example, Equestrienne (At the Circus Fernando)).\r Seurat makes use of Charles Henry's theories on the emotional and symbolic meaning of lines and colours, and the works of Chevreul and Ogden Rood on complementary colours. He was also influenced by Japanese prints, and the graphic works of Jules Ch\u00e9ret. The work is similar to chromolithograph Au cirque by Karl Gampenrieder, but it is not clear if Seurat had seen it.\r The work measures 185\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0152 centimetres (73\u00a0\u00d7\u00a060\u00a0in) (dimensions with frame painted by the artist: 232 x 198.5 cm). Seurat used a Neo-Impressionist Divisionist style, with pointillist dots creating the sense of other colours. The work is dominated by white and the three primary colours, mainly red and yellow with blue shading. A deeper blue border painted around the edge of the canvas, merging into a flat frame in the same shade of blue.\r The painting is divided into two spaces, with the circus artists occupying the lower right, characterised by curves and spirals creating a sense of movement, and the audience occupying the upper left, confined to rows of benches. The audience shows the distinctions between social classes sitting in rows, from the well-dressed higher classes near the front (sitting in the front row, in a top hat, is Seurat's friend and fellow painter Charles Angrand) to the lower classes in the gallery at the back.\r A sense of space is created by the whiteface clown in the foreground, facing away from the viewer, and the tiers of bleachers. Another pair of clowns are tumbling to the right behind the ringmaster.\r Seurat made few preparatory studies, concentrating on creating dynamic lines and using few colours.\r Le Cirque was first exhibited at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in March 1891, in an unfinished state. The work remained unfinished at Seurat's death a few days later: in places, the white ground and a grid of blue lines used by Seurat to create his composition are still visible. Early critics complained that the subjects were stiff, like automatons. Others later saw it as a forerunner of Cubism.\r The painting was returned to Seurat's mother after the exhibition in 1891, and she hung it in the room in the Boulevard de Magenta where he had died. The painting was acquired by Paul Signac around 1900, and then by American collector John Quinn, who donated the painting to the Louvre in 1927. It was exhibited at the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg, the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne and the Galerie du Jeu de Paume. It has been located at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay since 1977.\n", "\nArtist: Paul Gauguin\nArtwork Name: Still Life with Profile of Laval\nArtwork Genre: still life\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/still-life-with-profile-of-laval-1886\n\nWikipedia Article:\nStill Life with Profile of Laval is an 1886 oil painting by French artist Paul Gauguin, located in the Indianapolis Museum of Art, which is in Indianapolis, Indiana. It depicts Gauguin's friend Charles Laval in profile with an assortment of inanimate objects, including a ceramic pot Gauguin made himself.\r This combination portrait/still life shows Gauguin's ability to take the best of various artists he admired. For example, the abrupt way Laval's face is cut off is a tribute to Edgar Degas' off-centered, oddly-cropped compositions, while setup of the still life and the parallel brush strokes in the fruit harken to Paul C\u00e9zanne's work. In addition to those other much-admired artists, Gauguin inserted himself into the composition in the form of the ceramic \"monstrosity\" he created, a strange interruption which Laval examines quizzically. He deliberately quotes the two most renowned artists in the genres of modern life and still life, then refuses to resolve them harmoniously. Instead, Gauguin leaves them disrupted, even incoherent in this, his first in a series of paintings on the challenges of creativity. Laval, the viewer's surrogate, tries to guess his next move.\r Gauguin and Laval met in the summer of 1886, and the younger artist soon became Gauguin's pupil. This subservient role is indicated by Laval's fixed gaze upon the pot Gauguin made. The pot itself helps place the creation of this painting very late in 1886, after Gauguin had returned to Paris, because it was not created until at least October. Gauguin valued his ceramic experiments highly, as both artistic objects and sources of income. He wrote to his wife Mette that this particular pot was worth 100 francs. It cannot currently be located, and may have been destroyed.\r Vincent van Gogh had suggested a portrait exchange among the small group of artists (also including \u00c9mile Bernard) gathered at Pont-Aven in order to create a greater sense of community, a tradition known as Freundschaftsbild. By rendering them all in new artistic styles, the collective announced their abandonment of naturalism and adoption of Symbolism.\r Still Life with Profile of Laval was acquired in 1998 as part of a collection of Gauguin and his Pont-Aven coterie. Samuel Josefowitz, a Swiss collector, amassed the 17 paintings and 84 prints, worth an estimated $30 million. The Lilly Endowment raised $20 million toward that goal with a challenge grant. The remainder was raised by the IMA, with an undisclosed amount being given by Josefowitz himself, a museum trustee. Josefowitz also donated all the prints for free. He acquired the Pont-Aven collection in the 1950s and '60s, before that period's importance in Gauguin's development was fully appreciated. This particular painting hangs in the Jane H.

Together with The Yellow Christ, it is considered to be one of the key-works of Symbolism in painting. It depicts a Breton woman at the foot of a calvary, or sculpture of Christ's crucifixion. Calvaries are common in town squares in Brittany. The woman appears to be hiding from a pair of figures in the distant background; the green christ providing her cover from the figures.   Topographically, the site depicted is the Atlantic coast at Le Pouldu. But the calvary depicted is an amalgam of calvaires from different site; the cross is based upon that in the centre of N\u00e9vez, a community close to Pont-Aven and several miles from the coast, and the figure of Christ is based upon the calvaire at Briec - also some distance from the sea.\n", "\nArtist: Paul Gauguin\nArtwork Name: Arearea I\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/arearea-i-1892\n\nWikipedia Article:\nArearea is a 1892 work by French painter Paul Gauguin.

What Are We? Where Are We Going? is a painting by French artist Paul Gauguin. Gauguin inscribed the original French title in the upper left corner: D'o\u00f9 Venons Nous / Que Sommes Nous / O\u00f9 Allons Nous. The inscription the artist wrote on his canvas has no question mark, no dash, and all words are capitalized. In the upper right corner he signed and dated the painting: P. Gauguin / 1897. The painting was created in Tahiti, and is in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts, US.\r Gauguin had been a student at the Petit S\u00e9minaire de La Chapelle-Saint-Mesmin, just outside Orl\u00e9ans, from the age of eleven to the age of sixteen. His subjects there included a class in Catholic liturgy; the teacher for this class was the Bishop of Orl\u00e9ans, F\u00e9lix-Antoine-Philibert Dupanloup. Dupanloup had devised his own catechism to be lodged in the minds of the young schoolboys, and to lead them towards proper spiritual reflections on the nature of life. The three fundamental questions in this catechism were: \"Where does humanity come from?\" \"Where is it going to?\", \"How does humanity proceed?\". Although in later life Gauguin was vociferously anticlerical, these questions from Dupanloup's catechism obviously had lodged in his mind, and \"where?\" became the key question that Gauguin asked in his art.\r Looking for a society more simple and elemental than that of his native France, Gauguin left for Tahiti in 1891. In addition to several other paintings that express his highly individualistic mythology, he completed this painting in 1897 or 1898. Gauguin considered it a masterpiece and the grand culmination of his thought. He was in despair when he undertook the painting, mourning the tragic death of his favourite daughter earlier in the year and oppressed by debts, and had planned to kill himself on finishing it. He subsequently made an unsuccessful attempt with an overdose of arsenic. Thomson thinks it quite possible that he only painted in the inscription while recovering from the attempt.\r Gauguin indicated that the painting should be read from right to left, with the three major figure groups illustrating the questions posed in the title. The three women with a child represent the beginning of life; the middle group symbolizes the daily existence of young adulthood; and in the final group, according to the artist, \"an old woman approaching death appears reconciled and resigned to her thoughts\"; at her feet, \"a strange white bird...represents the futility of words.\" The blue idol in the background apparently represents what Gauguin described as \"the Beyond.\" Of its entirety he said, \"I believe that this canvas not only surpasses all my preceding ones, but that I shall never do anything better\u2014or even like it.\"\r The painting is an accentuation of Gauguin's trailblazing post-impressionistic style; his art stressed the vivid use of colors and thick brushstrokes, tenets of the impressionists (though the Impressionists focused on quick brushstrokes), while it aimed to convey an emotional or expressionistic strength. It emerged in conjunction with other avant-garde movements of the twentieth century, including cubism and fauvism.\n", "\nArtist: Amedeo Modigliani\nArtwork Name: Jacques and Berthe Lipchitz\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/amedeo-modigliani/jacques-and-berthe-lipchitz-1917\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJacques and Berthe Lipchitz is a 1916 oil on canvas painting by Amedeo Modigliani. It depicts Modigliani's friend, the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz, standing alongside his seated wife Berthe.\r Modigliani and Lipchitz had each moved to France at a young age, were both from Jewish backgrounds, and became close friends who frequented the same artistic circles in Paris. Despite their commonalities, there were marked differences: Lipchitz exemplified artistic industriousness while Modigliani was given to bohemian dissolution.\r Before painting Jacques and Berthe Lipchitz Modigliani made a series of preparatory drawings, of which five survive: two of Lipchitz, two of Berthe, and one of them together in the resolved composition. Lipchitz described the painting's development years later:\r Lipchitz was uncomfortable accepting the painting for merely ten francs, and made excuses in order for Modigliani to continue working on the portrait. \"You know\", I said, \"we sculptors like more substance.\" \"Well,\" he answered, \"if you want me to spoil it, I can continue.\" The portrait occupied Modigliani for nearly two weeks, \"probably the longest time he ever worked on one painting.\"\r One of only two double portraits painted by Modigliani, Jacques and Berthe Lipchitz has been noted for its complex and enigmatic study of contrasting personalities. Lipchitz is shown with his wife Berthe Kitrosser, a Russian poet, in their Paris apartment that had previously been the home of the sculptor Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i. Posed in front of an abstracted architectural interior, Lipchitz is handsomely dressed, and stands casually with one hand on Berthe's shoulder. Their mask-like faces have encouraged varied readings; Berthe's gentle sensuality, her large eyes and lips and graceful neck, have been seen to offer a striking contrast to Lipchitz's self-pride, his small eyes and mouth and \"wickedly twisted nose\" combining to satirical effect. For art historian Mason Klein, Berthe's face is bland and bourgeois, her frilly collar and pert nose suggesting haughtiness, while Lipchitz stands above her, domineering and protective.\r Modigliani biographer Werner Schmalenbach compared Jacques and Berthe Lipchitz to the artist's Bride and Groom of 1915, and noted the development away from a purely formal depiction of 'types' to a greater interest in the characterization of individuals. This difference in the two works is consistent with an evolution in Modigliani's drawing and painting toward increased refinement.\r After Modigliani died in 1920 Lipchitz crafted his death mask, making twelve plaster molds for Modigliani's friends and family. Soon thereafter Lipchitz traded the painting to his dealer in exchange for the return of sculptures \"which I no longer felt were representative.\" The painting was purchased in 1922, and entered the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926 as part of the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection.\n", "\nArtist: Amedeo Modigliani\nArtwork Name: Nude seating on a sofa\nArtwork Genre: nude painting (nu)\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/amedeo-modigliani/nude-seating-on-a-sofa-1917\n\nWikipedia Article:\nNude Sitting on a Divan (The Beautiful Roman Woman) is an oil on canvas painting by Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani depicting a partially draped woman seated with crossed legs against a warm red background. The work was one of a series of nudes painted by Modigliani in 1917 that created a sensation when exhibited in Paris that year. On November 2, 2010, the painting sold at a New York auction for $68.9 million, a record price for an artwork by Modigliani.\r The several dozen nudes Modigliani painted between 1916 and 1919 constitute many of his best-known works. Simultaneously abstracted and erotically detailed, they exhibit a formal grace referencing nude figures of the Italian Renaissance while at the same time objectifying their subjects' sexuality; they \"exemplify his position between tradition and modernism\". The nudes of this period are \"displayed boldly, with only the faintest suggestion of setting.... neither demure nor provocative, they are depicted with a degree of objectivity. Yet the uniformly thick, rough application of paint\u2014 as if applied by a sculptor's hand\u2014 is more concerned with mass and the visceral perception of the female body than with titillation and the re-creation of translucent, tactile flesh\".\r This series of nudes was commissioned by Modigliani's dealer and friend Leopold Zborowski, who lent the artist use of his apartment, supplied models and painting materials, and paid him between fifteen and twenty francs each day for his work. The paintings from this arrangement were thus different from his previous depictions of friends and lovers in that they were funded by Zborowski either for his own collection, as a favor to his friend, or with an eye to their \"commercial potential\", rather than originating from the artist's personal circle of acquaintances.\r The Paris show of 1917 was Modigliani's only solo exhibition during his life, and is \"notorious\" in modern art history for its sensational public reception and the attendant issues of obscenity. The show was closed by police on its opening day, but continued thereafter, most likely after the removal of paintings from the gallery's streetfront window.\r According to the catalogue description from the 2010 sale at Sotheby's, seven nudes were exhibited in the 1917 show, four of them titled Nu; \"the present work may have been among these pictures.... the models' permissiveness and the artist's accessibility to them implied that these oils were post coital-renderings, the women still flush and basking in the afterglow\".\r In 1999 Nude Sitting on a Divan sold at Sotheby's for $16.7 million, a record price for a painting by the artist. The most recent sale far surpassed the pre-sale estimate of $40 million, as well as the previous record for one of Modigliani's works, $52.6 million for a sculpture.\n", "\nArtist: Amedeo Modigliani\nArtwork Name: The Boy\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/amedeo-modigliani/the-boy\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Boy is an oil painting by Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani created in 1919. It is currently part of the permanent collection at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.\r The portrait is of an unknown male youth, sitting at a chair, his left elbow on a table, and his head resting on his palm. The Boy is a typical Modigliani portrait. The boy's face is elongated into an oval, his eyes are hollow and without pupils. He wears a blue shirt, that seems to blend him into the background. His cheeks are rosy and youthful, which contrasts with the hollow eyes. His face is mask-like and expressionless. The portrait is enlivened by the artist's brushstrokes, even in the limited color palette. Unlike most of Modigliani's subjects, this sitter cannot be identified.\r Modigliani was dying of tubercular meningitis by the time he painted this portrait. He was forced by his doctors to move to southern France from Paris, in hopes that it would improve his failing health. Along with this, Paris was becoming increasingly less safe as World War I heightened. While there, Modigliani shifted his focus to painting unnamed, young workers, like the one portrayed in The Boy. Modigliani's portraits and sculptures reveal the influence of ancient Greek and African sculpture that started to hold more sway in the modern art world. Modigliani's work is easily recognized by his elegent, elongated figures.\r The painting was purchased from the artist by Leopold Zborowski, a Polish-born art dealer who represented Modigliani. By 1929, it was bought by Maurice J. Speiser, a Philadelphia-based attorney and patron of the arts, and was illustrated in a Modern Art catalog that same year. It was auctioned in New York in January 1944. It was likely purchased by Theodore Schempp from there.

All record a moment before the death of his older sister Johanne Sophie (1862\u20131877) from tuberculosis at 14. Munch returned to this deeply traumatic event again and again in his art, over six completed oil paintings and many studies in various media, over a period of more than 40 years. In the works, Sophie is typically shown on her deathbed accompanied by a dark-haired, grieving woman assumed to be her aunt Karen; the studies often show her in a cropped head shot. In all the painted versions Sophie is sitting in a chair, obviously suffering from pain, propped by a large white pillow, looking towards an ominous curtain likely intended as a symbol of death. She is shown with a haunted expression, clutching hands with a grief-stricken older woman who seems to want to comfort her but whose head is bowed as if she cannot bear to look the younger girl in the eye.  Throughout his career, Munch  often returned to and created several variants of his paintings. The Sick Child became for Munch\u2014who nearly died from tuberculosis himself as a child\u2014a means to record both his feelings of despair and guilt that he had been the one to survive and to confront his feelings of loss for his late sister. He became obsessive with the image, and during the decades that followed he created numerous versions in a variety of formats. The six painted works were executed over a period of more than 40 years, using a number of different models.  The series has been described as \"a vivid study of the ravages of a degenerative disease.\" All of the paintings and many of the ancillary works are considered significant to Munch's oeuvre. An 1896 lithograph in black, yellow and red was sold in 2001 at Sotheby's for $250,000.  Each painting shows Sophie in profile, lying on her deathbed, and obviously having difficulty breathing, a symptom of advanced, severe tuberculosis. She is propped from her waist up by a large thick white pillow which partially hides a large circular mirror hung on the wall behind her. She is covered by a heavy dark blanket. She has red hair and is shown as frail and with a sickly pallor and vacant stare. She looks towards a dark and portentous full-length curtain to her left, which many art historians interpret as a symbol of death.  A dark-haired and older woman in a black dress sits by the child's bedside, holding her hand. The bond between the two is established through the joining of their hands, which are positioned at the exact center of each work.

The German title Munch gave these works is Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature). The works show a figure with an agonized expression against a landscape with a tumultuous orange sky. Arthur Lubow has described The Scream as \"an icon of modern art, a Mona Lisa for our time.\"\r Edvard Munch created the four versions in various media. The National Gallery in Oslo, Norway, holds one of two painted versions (1893, shown here). The Munch Museum holds the other painted version (1910, see gallery, below) and a pastel version from 1893. These three versions have not traveled for years, though the pastel version was on display in a temporary exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam in 2015.\r The fourth version (pastel, 1895) was sold for $119,922,600 at Sotheby's Impressionist and Modern Art auction on 2 May 2012 to financier Leon Black, the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at auction. The pastel was on display in the Museum of Modern Art in New York from October 2012 to April 2013.\r Also in 1895, Munch created a lithograph stone of the image. Of the lithograph prints produced by Munch, several examples survive. Only approximately four dozen prints were made before the original stone was resurfaced by the printer in Munch's absence.\r The Scream has been the target of several high-profile art thefts. In 1994, the version in the National Gallery was stolen. It was recovered several months later. In 2004, both The Scream and Madonna were stolen from the Munch Museum, and both were recovered two years later.\r The original German title given by Munch to his work was Der Schrei der Natur (\"The Scream of Nature\"). The Norwegian title, Skrik is cognate with the English \"shriek\". Occasionally, the painting also has been called The Cry.\r In his diary in an entry headed \"Nice 22 January 1892\", Munch wrote:\r He later described his inspiration for the image:\r Among theories advanced to account for the reddish sky in the background is the artist's memory of the effects of the powerful volcanic eruption of Krakatoa, which deeply tinted sunset skies red in parts of the Western hemisphere for months during 1883 and 1884, about a decade before Munch painted The Scream. This explanation has been disputed by scholars, who note that Munch was an expressive painter and was not primarily interested in literal renderings of what he had seen. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the proximity of both a slaughterhouse and a lunatic asylum to the site depicted in the painting may have offered some inspiration. The scene was identified as being the view from a road overlooking Oslo, the Oslofjord and Hoved\u00f8ya, from the hill of Ekeberg. At the time of painting the work, Munch's manic depressive sister Laura Catherine was a patient at the asylum at the foot of Ekeberg.\n", "\nArtist: Edvard Munch\nArtwork Name: Anxiety\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edvard-munch/anxiety-1894\n\nWikipedia Article:\nAnxiety (Norwegian: Angst) is an oil-on-canvas painting created by the expressionist artist Edvard Munch in 1894.

Munch is an artist native to Norway and is widely known for his role in expressionistic art. Puberty has also been done as a lithograph and an etching by Munch.\r In the late 1880s and into the mid-1890s, Munch, in his mid-twenties, had begun to create his series of Puberty pieces. At this time Munch had already established himself as a notable artist in Berlin. During this period of his life Munch often found residence in Berlin, where his newfound fame and circle of friends were. His new group of friends are attributed for helping push Munch further into his sexually depressed state of mind. Munch allowed this sexual depression to seep into Puberty and like other works he created later this piece was created with symbolism reflecting feelings which continued growing increasingly within the next ten years. This state of sexual depression is one that not only his circle of friends shared with him, but that the psychological scholars had also been curious about having just written the first research on the stages and occurrences of puberty in young adults.\r Munch's painting Puberty depicts a young naked girl sitting on the edge of a bed. Her legs are pressed together. She holds her hands in front of her body; one lies between her knees, while the other rests on her right thigh. She stares straight ahead with eyes wide open. Her mouth is closed and her long hair hangs down over the shoulders. The light enters from the left, and behind her a dark, ominous shadow is visible. The motif is often regarded as a symbol of anxiety and fear, a young girl's awakening sexuality and the changes a young person experiences physically and psychologically on the path towards adulthood. \r Puberty was a spark towards the progress of his personal emotional journey in how he portrayed his feelings in his artwork.\n", "\nArtist: Edvard Munch\nArtwork Name: Jealousy\nArtwork Genre: symbolic painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edvard-munch/jealousy-1895\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJealousy (Norwegian: Sjalusi) is a painting by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch. Munch returned to this image throughout his whole life - he completed no less than 11 painted versions of Jealousy. The first painting was executed in 1895, and the last was made during the 1930s. Munch also created four lithograph versions and one drypoint of Jealousy. \r The painting was made during European period and is based on expressionism style. The 1895 oil on canvas painting, perhaps the most famous version, is now housed at Rasmus Meyer Collection, Bergen and it measures 67 by 100 centimeters. In addition, eight painted versions are possessed by the Munch Museum in Oslo and one version is located at the St\u00e4del Museum in Frankfurt am Main (on loan from a private collection).

Munch painted six different versions of the subject in the period 1893\u201395; three versions are at the Munch Museum in Oslo, one is at the Gothenburg Museum of Art, one is owned by a private collector and the last one is unaccounted for. He also painted several versions and derivatives in his later career. \r The painting shows a woman with long flame-red hair kissing a man on the neck, as the couple embrace. Although others have seen in it \"a man locked in a vampire's tortured embrace \u2013 her molten-red hair running along his soft bare skin,\" Munch himself always claimed it showed nothing more than \"just a woman kissing a man on the neck\".\r The painting was first called \"Vampire\" by Munch's friend, the critic Stanis\u0142aw Przybyszewski. Przybyszewski saw the painting on exhibition and described it as \"a man who has become submissive, and on his neck a biting vampire's face.\"\r A version of the painting was stolen from the Munch Museum on 23 February 1988. It was recovered later the same year, when the thief contacted the police. \r In 2008, at a Sotheby's auction, an 1894 version of the painting sold for 38.2 million dollars (24.3 million pounds) and set the world record for the auction of a Munch painting.\r In 1895, Munch created a woodcut with a very similar theme and composition, known as Vampyr II.\r In 1916\u201318, Munch reused the composition in a different setting for two paintings called Vampire in the Forest and Vampire, currently in the collection of the Munch Museum.\r  Media related to Vampire by Edvard Munch at Wikimedia Commons\n", "\nArtist: Edvard Munch\nArtwork Name: Kiss\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edvard-munch/kiss-1897\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Kiss is an oil painting on canvas completed by the Norwegian symbolist artist Edvard Munch in 1897. Part of his Frieze of Life, which depicts the stages of a relationship between men and women, The Kiss is a realization of a motif with which he had experimented since 1888/89: a couple kissing, their faces fusing as one in a symbolic representation of their unity. Exhibited as early as 1903, this work is held at the Munch Museum in Oslo.\r The Kiss is an oil painting on canvas, measuring 81 by 99 centimetres (32\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a039\u00a0in). It depicts a couple surrounded by darkness, with only a sliver of daylight showing through a window which is mostly covered by a curtain. They hold an embrace as they seemingly merge into one, their faces a single, featureless shape. Art critic Roberta Smith notes that Munch favored \"long, somewhat slurpy brush strokes that were more stained than painted\".\r The painting is similar to, though simpler than, another work with the same theme Munch produced in the same period.\r The Norwegian symbolist artist Edvard Munch (1863\u20131944) had to cope with disease, mental illness, and death in his family, as well as a strict and strongly religious father. During his lifetime he experienced disappointment in love and feeble health, causing him fits of melancholia; Munch also became an alcoholic. The artist never married. This influenced his artistic production and the emotional states of his paintings. \"Most of Munch\u2019s figures,\" writes Roberta Smith, \"are not mad, but paralyzed by oceanic feelings of grief, jealousy, desire or despair that many people found shocking either for their eroticism, crude style or intimations of mental instability.\" Though shocking, his paintings are characterized by an emotional honesty and integrity that makes them thrilling.\r Munch experimented with the motif of a couple kissing, both in painting and woodcuts, as early as 1888\u201389. In the numerous realizations of this motif there is a contrast between the world inside and outside of the room in which the couple is situated. The outside world appears vibrant and lively, whereas the interior of the room is timeless, with the couple frozen in their embrace. In this motif, the couple's abstract form, in which the faces of the two appear to be merged as one, indicates their sense of belongingness and togetherness. Later versions of the motif not only merged their faces, but also their bodies. The motif was part of a series Munch called the Frieze of Life, on which he spent more than 30 years of his career. The cycle depicts stages of a relationship between men and women and is part of what Munch called \"the battle between men and women that is called love\". It includes portrayals of attraction, courtship, realization, and disappointment.\r According to the Museum of Modern Art, the dark ambiance of The Kiss is representative of Munch's ambivalence regarding romance. In the 1897 painting, art historian Reinhold Heller finds it \"virtually impossible\" to separate the two figures, particularly where their faces meet and become one. He considers the depiction of the lovers to represent their unity while at the same time representing a threatening \"loss of individuality, a loss of one's own existence and identity\" which hints at death.\n", "\nArtist: Edvard Munch\nArtwork Name: Christmas in the Brothel\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edvard-munch/christmas-in-the-brothel-1905\n\nWikipedia Article:\nChristmas in the Brothel (Norwegian: Julaften i bordell) is an oil-on-canvas painting by Norwegian painter Edvard Munch. The Expressionist painting was completed in 1903\u201304 and is housed at the Munch Museum in Oslo.\r The painting was done at a difficult time for Munch: a commission for a portrait in Hamburg (of a Senator Holthusen, the father in law of Munch's patron Max Linde) had come to naught because of disagreements. As a result, Munch suffered anxieties, which he attempted to manage with alcohol. A visit to a brothel in L\u00fcbeck is supposedly the background to Christmas in the Brothel, a \"light yet melancholy\" painting in which the working girls in a brothel have just finished decorating a Christmas tree. \"Ironic, sentimentally unholy\", the painting is interpreted as a commentary on both Linde's upper-class household (where Munch was staying at the time) and Munch's own \"pietistic home background\". Like other paintings of the period, it shows Munch's association with Fauvism. Prostitution was a favored topic of Munch's, and one particular room in a German brothel would later inspire an entire series of paintings, The Green Room.\n", "\nArtist: Edvard Munch\nArtwork Name: The Sick Child (later)\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edvard-munch/the-sick-child-1886\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Sick Child (Norwegian: Det syke barn) is the title given to six paintings and a number of lithographs, drypoints and etchings completed by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch (1863\u20131944), between 1885 and 1926. All record a moment before the death of his older sister Johanne Sophie (1862\u20131877) from tuberculosis at 14. Munch returned to this deeply traumatic event again and again in his art, over six completed oil paintings and many studies in various media, over a period of more than 40 years. In the works, Sophie is typically shown on her deathbed accompanied by a dark-haired, grieving woman assumed to be her aunt Karen; the studies often show her in a cropped head shot. In all the painted versions Sophie is sitting in a chair, obviously suffering from pain, propped by a large white pillow, looking towards an ominous curtain likely intended as a symbol of death. She is shown with a haunted expression, clutching hands with a grief-stricken older woman who seems to want to comfort her but whose head is bowed as if she cannot bear to look the younger girl in the eye.\r Throughout his career, Munch often returned to and created several variants of his paintings. The Sick Child became for Munch\u2014who nearly died from tuberculosis himself as a child\u2014a means to record both his feelings of despair and guilt that he had been the one to survive and to confront his feelings of loss for his late sister. He became obsessive with the image, and during the decades that followed he created numerous versions in a variety of formats. The six painted works were executed over a period of more than 40 years, using a number of different models.\r The series has been described as \"a vivid study of the ravages of a degenerative disease\". All of the paintings and many of the ancillary works are considered significant to Munch's oeuvre. An 1896 lithograph in black, yellow and red was sold in 2001 at Sotheby's for $250,000.\r Each painting shows Sophie in profile, lying on her deathbed, and obviously having difficulty breathing, a symptom of advanced, severe tuberculosis. She is propped from her waist up by a large thick white pillow which partially hides a large circular mirror hung on the wall behind her. She is covered by a heavy dark blanket. She has red hair and is shown as frail and with a sickly pallor and vacant stare. She looks towards a dark and portentous full-length curtain to her left, which many art historians interpret as a symbol of death.\r A dark-haired and older woman in a black dress sits by the child's bedside, holding her hand. The bond between the two is established through the joining of their hands, which are positioned at the exact center of each work. Their shared grip is typically rendered with such pathos and intensity that art historians believe that not only did the two figures share a deep emotional bond, but that they were most likely blood relations. In probability the woman is Sophie's aunt Karen. Some critics have observed that the older woman is more distressed than the child; in the words of critic Patricia Donahue, \"It is almost as though the child, knowing that nothing more can be done, is comforting a person who has reached the end of her endurance\". The woman's head is bowed in anguish to the extent that she seems unable to look directly at Sophie. Because of this, her face is obscured and the viewer can only see the top of her head. A bottle is placed on a dressing table or locker to the left. A glass can be seen to the right on a vaguely described table.\n", "\nArtist: Paul Klee\nArtwork Name: Twittering Machine\nArtwork Genre: figurative\nArtwork Media: gouache,ink,paper,watercolor\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-klee/twittering-machine-1922\n\nWikipedia Article:\nTwittering Machine (Die Zwitscher-Maschine) is a 1922 watercolor and pen and ink oil transfer on paper by Swiss-German painter Paul Klee. Like other artworks by Klee, it blends biology and machinery, depicting a loosely sketched group of birds on a wire or branch connected to a hand-crank. Interpretations of the work vary widely: it has been perceived as a nightmarish lure for the viewer or a depiction of the helplessness of the artist, but also as a triumph of nature over mechanical pursuits. It has been seen as a visual representation of the mechanics of sound.\r Originally displayed in Germany, the image was declared \"degenerate art\" by Adolf Hitler in 1933 and sold by the Nazi Party to an art dealer in 1939, whence it made its way to New York. One of the better known of more than 9,000 works produced by Klee, it is among the more famous images of the New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). It has inspired several musical compositions and, according to a 1987 magazine profile in New York Magazine, has been a popular piece to hang in children's bedrooms.\r The picture depicts a group of birds, largely line drawings; all save the first are shackled on a wire or, according to The Washington Post, a \"sine-wave branch\" over a blue and purple background which the MoMA equates with the \"misty cool blue of night giving way to the pink flow of dawn\". Each of the birds is open-beaked, with a jagged or rounded shape emerging from its mouth, widely interpreted as its protruding tongue. The end of the perch dips into a crank.\r Twittering Machine has invited very different opinions on its meaning, which Gardner's Art Through the Ages (2009) suggests is characteristic of Klee's work: \"Perhaps no other artist of the 20th century matched Klee's subtlety as he deftly created a world of ambiguity and understatement that draws each viewer into finding a unique interpretation of the work.\" The image has frequently been perceived as whimsical, with a 1941 article in The Hartford Courant describing it as \"characterized by the exquisite absurdity of Lewis Carroll's \"Twas brillig and the slithy toves\" and The Riverside Dictionary of Biography placing it in \"a very personal world of free fancy\".\r Sometimes, the image is perceived as quite dark. MoMA suggests that, while evocative of an \"abbreviated pastoral\", the painting inspires \"an uneasy sensation of looming menace\" as the birds themselves \"appear closer to deformations of nature\". They speculate that the \"twittering machine\" may in fact be a music box that produces a \"fiendish cacophony\" as it \"lure[s] victims to the pit over which the machine hovers\". Kay Larson of New York magazine (1987), too, found menace in the image, which she describes as \"a fierce parable of the artist's life among the philistines\": \"Like Charles Chaplin caught in the gears of Modern Times, they [the birds] whir helplessly, their heads flopping in exhaustion and pathos. One bird's tongue flies up out of its beak, an exclamation point punctuating its grim fate\u2014to chirp under compulsion.\"\n", "\nArtist: Franz Marc\nArtwork Name: The Yellow Cow\nArtwork Genre: animal painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/the-yellow-cow-1911\n\nWikipedia Article:\nYellow Cow (German: Gelbe Kuh) is a painting by the German artist Franz Marc, dating to 1911. It is one of the artist\u2019s most well known works, and is one of several of his depictions of animals in Expressionist style. This work is oil on canvas and measures 140.5 x 189.2 centimeters. The central motif of the Yellow Cow painting is a jumping cow, surrounded by a colorful, structured landscape. The painting is characterized by the contrast between the dynamic central motif and the calm background.\r The painting is in the collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and has been shown at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.\r Yellow Cow dates to Marc\u2019s formative phase, during which he developed the Farbsymbolik (color symbolism) that permeates the painting. For Marc, blue was equated with spirituality and maleness, yellow with femininity and sensuality, and red with the earth. The colors in the painting should therefore not be taken as naturalistic, but rather, as symbolically representing the sense of the objects in the work.\r Marc's use of color (in this work and others) was greatly influenced by the Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky.\r According to art historian Mark Rosenthal, Yellow Cow can be seen as a veiled depiction of Marc\u2019s wife, Maria Franck, whom he married the same year the painting was created.\n", "\nArtist: Franz Marc\nArtwork Name: The Tower of Blue Horses\nArtwork Genre: symbolic painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/the-tower-of-blue-horses-1913\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Tower of Blue Horses (German: Der Turm der blauen Pferde) is a 1913 Expressionist oil painting by the German artist Franz Marc. It has been called one of his best works, but went missing in 1945.\r The Tower of Blue Horses was a large work, 200 by 130 centimetres (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a04\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in). Most of the picture is occupied by a frontal view of four primarily blue horses, arranged in a tier to the right of centre, facing the viewer but with their heads turned to the left; the foremost horse seemed \"only a little less than life size\" to at least one writer. To the left of their rumps, which form the centre of the picture, is an abstract landscape; above it is an orange rainbow on a yellow background. The foremost horse has a crescent moon on its chest, and crosses on its body which suggest stars.\r Marc created the painting in summer 1913. A preliminary sketch in ink and gouache survives in the form of a new year's postcard for that year to the poet Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, one of 28 painted postcards which the artist sent to her and which she answered in illustrated letters later used in her novel Malik. The Blue Horses sketch uses her favourite colour, blue, and personal symbols of hers, the moon and stars. This is now in the Munich State Graphics Collection. The large-format painting was one of seven works by Marc exhibited that autumn in the First German Autumn Salon (Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon).\r After World War I, The Tower of Blue Horses was one of the works by Marc acquired for the new contemporary annexe of the Berlin National Gallery housed in the Kronprinzenpalais. It was removed from there as part of the \"cleansing\" of modern art works under the Nazis, and included in the Degenerate Art exhibition which opened in July 1937 in Munich. However, in response to a protest by veterans because Marc had died fighting for his country in the war, the painting was removed and was not included in the exhibition when it opened in Berlin. At that time it was valued at 80,000 Reichsmarks. In spring 1936, now valued at 20,000 RM, it was then transferred to Hermann G\u00f6ring's custody as part of a select group of valuable modernist paintings which also included two other works by Marc. G\u00f6ring sold at least some of these at a considerable profit, but appears not to have sold The Tower of Blue Horses, which went missing at war's end.\r Edwin Redslob\u00a0(de), an art historian who became Rector of the Free University of Berlin, wrote in 1977 that he had seen the painting in the Haus am Waldsee in Zehlendorf, Berlin, while still under Soviet occupation, i.e., in the first half of 1945, and the journalist Joachim Nawrocki reported having seen it in the adjacent youth hostel in the winter of the Berlin blockade, 1948/49, with two or three slits cut in it. Other statements and theories about the fate of the painting that have been published include its having been destroyed at Carinhall when G\u00f6ring had the house blown up as the Russians advanced towards it in 1945, its having been in the Prussian Chamber of Deputies, and its being in Switzerland, most likely in a bank safe in Zurich; in 2001 an art collector claimed to have been offered it for sale. Art historian Roland M\u00e4rz\u00a0(de) put the painting on the catalogue cover when he organised an exhibition on the German Expressionists in 1986 at the (then East German) National Gallery, hoping that \"a little old lady from the eastern Ore Mountains would come into [his] office and unroll a canvas out of which the crystals of blue pigment would spill\", and has continued to search for it, but it has not reappeared.\n", "\nArtist: Franz Marc\nArtwork Name: The Fate of the Animals\nArtwork Genre: abstract,animal painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/fate-of-the-animals\n\nWikipedia Article:\nFate of the Animals is a painting by Franz Marc created in 1913. It is oil on canvas. This work contrasts most of Marc's other works by presenting animals in a brutal way rather than depicting them in a peaceful manner. Marc's strong ties with animals as his subjects remains uncertain, but it is predicted to stem from his childhood dog. Fate of the Animals remains one of Marc's most famous pieces and displays Der Blaue Reiter style that he co-founded with Wassily Kandinsky. The painting currently resides in the Kunstmuseum in Basel, Switzerland.\r The last third of the painting was damaged in a warehouse fire in 1916 after Marc's death and was later restored by one of his close friends, Paul Klee. Klee restored the painting using old photographs. He added a brownish tint to the paint creating an obvious variation from the rest of the painting. Scholars have yet to figure out his decision to paint with a brown tint. Many opinions on the subject have been given, although none have been proven.\r The title of the work is known as Fate of the Animals in English. This stems from the German name Tierschicksale which figuratively translates to animal destinies. Paul Klee is also known for suggesting an alternate title: The trees show their rings, the animals their veins. This is from the evident tree rings present as well as the green horse on the right whose veins are visible on its body. On the back of the canvas is believed to be the subtitle of the painting, which translates to \"And all being is flaming suffering.\"\r Fate of the Animals's title derives from the chaotic scene depicted. There are animals scattered throughout the canvas in what is referred to as a post apocalyptic setting. The scene depicts a forest that is being destroyed by the flames that are evident all around. The painting consists of a blue deer in the middle of the canvas, two boars on the left side, two horses, above the boars, and four unidentified figures on the right. The four unidentified animals are believed to be either deer, foxes, or wolves. Most scholars believe that the animals are deer based on Marc's older works where he depicts them with the same colors and physical attributes.\r It is a premonition to World War I that Marc experienced living in Germany. The brutality of the animals lives at the depicted moment reflected what the oncoming war would be doing to the people of the world. The destruction, the chaos, and the sadness that the viewer sees sums up the evident outcome the future war would bring.\r The painting contains only diagonal lines. The lack of horizontal and vertical lines throughout the painting along with the deep colors, create tension. This tension further highlights the chaos and violence of the animals lives. These diagonals are emphasized in three primary ways: composition order, diagonal posture of the animals, and \u201cthe animal\u2019s position in conformity with the diagonals.\" The diagonals also help with the narration by acting as fire sparks scattering across the canvas.\n", "\nArtist: Arnold B\u00f6cklin\nArtwork Name: The Plague\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/arnold-bocklin/the-plague-1898\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPlague is an 1898 painting in tempera by the Swiss symbolist artist Arnold B\u00f6cklin, held in the Kunstmuseum Basel.

On a surface of 106 square metres 11.263 glass squares in 72 colours of 9,6 cm \u00d7 9.6cm were randomly arranged. The window was inaugurated on August 25, 2007 as part of a Eucharistic celebration; the abstract execution was both celebrated and strongly criticized.  Originally, in 1863, windows with the depiction of secular and Christian rulers made by the Royal Stained Glass Institute in Berlin-Charlottenburg had been installed, donated by the Kingdom of Prussia. The windows were destroyed in World War II and replaced in 1948 by a simple ornamental glazing by Wilhelm Teuwen\u00a0[de], that was in need of restoration. Because of their colourlessness, the incident light was very bright, which was perceived as very disturbing.  In 2003 the cathedral chapter for the Cologne cathedral decided to have the window renewed. The original designs from the 19th century were, like the stained glass windows themselves, destroyed in World War II and no longer available. It was planned to make a memorial to the German martyrs of the twentieth century, such as Edith Stein and Maximilian Kolbe, and to commemorate the Holocaust. The visual designs of the commissioned artists Egbert Verbeek\u00a0[de]   and Manfred H\u00fcrlimann could not convince the cathedral chapter, but the abstract design by Gerhard Richter, who had been asked to provide one by master builder Barbara Schock-Werner did. He had cut up a photo of his painting 4096 farben from 1974  and pasted it behind the tracery of the window. In 2005 the cathedral chapter asked Richter to develop the design further. In 2006, the artist was finally commissioned.   The \u20ac370,000 in manufacturing costs were funded by about 1,200 donors; Gerhard Richter himself worked without a fee.  From a palette of 800, Richter chose 72 colours that were also in use in the medieval windows of the cathedral and those of the 19th century.   The coloured squares were arranged by a random number generator. Reflections and repetitions were predetermined, the lanes 1 and 3, 2 and 5 as well as 4 and 6 mirror each other.  At a few spots Richter made corrections to the distribution, for example where the arrangement of the pixel  was suggestive of meaning, for example in the lower part the number \"1\". Richter said to that: \"I rather held myself back. I wanted the window to have something self-evident, something everyday, at least it should not be 'color noise'. Not too warm, not too cold, restrained, as neutral as possible.\"  \"This interaction of chance and calculation created an abstract 'colour-tone carpet' whose particles glow in the light of day and are not held together with lead cames, but fixed on a support disc with silicone gel, so that the coloured facets interact without the usual lines in the glass painting. In addition, the different incidence of light continually changes the colour effect of the window\".   The window was fabricated by Derix Glasstudios.\n", "\nArtist: Odd Nerdrum\nArtwork Name: The Murder of Andreas Baader\nArtwork Genre: genre painting,history painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/the-murder-of-andreas-baader-1978\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Murder of Andreas Baader (Norwegian: Mordet p\u00e5 Andreas Baader) is a 1978 painting by the Norwegian artist Odd Nerdrum. It depicts the speculative murder of Andreas Baader, one of the leaders of the terrorist organisation Red Army Faction, in the Stammheim Prison in 1977.  The painting is in the collections of the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art in Oslo.  Andreas Baader is partially naked in his cell in the Stammheim Prison. Two men hold Baader while a third lies beaten on the floor before him. A fourth man in trenchcoat executes Baader with a gun shot to the back of the neck. The men are positioned in the shape of a St Andrew's Cross. The composition and chiaroscuro are inspired by Baroque art, with associations to Caravaggio's Crucifixion of St. Peter.  Baader had died on 18 October 1977 in what became known as the Stammheim \"Death Night\", when also Gudrun Ensslin and Jan-Carl Raspe died. In the official version they committed suicide, but rumours and theories spread quickly that they had been murdered by secret agents. Nerdrum was an anarchist at the time he made the painting. He later described his attraction to the Baader-Meinhof group: \"What particularly fascinated me was the expression of the free man that I saw in them. Otherwise I had sympathy for Baader to the extent that he was one of the many who were ready to die for their cause. To me he was the uncompromising, tragic idealist.\"  The painting was presented at H\u00f8stutstillingen in Oslo in 1978. It immediately drew strong reactions in both Norway and Germany for its way of depicting a terrorist as a religious martyr, as well as supposing he was murdered. The painting established Nerdrum as a political voice in the Norwegian public discourse.\n", "\nArtist: Bernardo Bellotto\nArtwork Name: The imperial summer residence Schloss Hof, courtyard\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/bernardo-bellotto/the-imperial-summer-residence-courtyard-1758\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  Schloss Hof is a palace located in Marchfeld, Austria near the border of Slovakia.

C. Dahl of the mountainous view from Stalheim, Voss, Hordaland. It is a major work of Romantic nationalism and has become a national icon. It is regarded as one of Dahl's best works.\r The painting shows the view from the peak at Stalheim over the N\u00e6r\u00f8y Valley towards the sugar-loaf shaped peak of Jordalsnuten in late afternoon sunshine, framed by peaks and a rainbow. The sun shines on a small village near the centre. Dahl has clearly delineated figures and buildings even in the distance, creating \"a world in miniature\". One of his purposes was realism; the other was to capture the glory and magnificence of the mountains, and associated with that, of his country's culture. In this evocation of grandeur the painting prefigures later US landscapes, in particular Church's Rainy Season in the Tropics (1866), which has a similar crowning rainbow. The rainbow itself, a symbol of reconciliation, peace, and in Christianity of God's grace, was also frequently used by Joseph Anton Koch and by Dahl's friend and associate Caspar David Friedrich.\r Dahl began work on the painting in 1836 and completed it in 1842. It is based on two pencil and watercolour sketches he had made from the Gudvangen road in July 1826 during his first visit to the high mountain regions of Norway. The final version is close to the studies in both composition and details, including the sunlight highlighting the village; but Dahl has intensified the imagery by narrowing the valley, giving more prominence to the Jordalsnuten peak and less to the reappearance of the river from the shadows.\r Dahl had trouble with the painting and avoided similarly large works after its completion.\r The painting was made for Countess Wedel of Bogstad. Carl Gustav Wedel-Jarlsberg gave it to the National Gallery of Norway in 1914.\r The painting is regarded as one of Dahl's best, perhaps his most successful realisation of his aim of depicting the mountains both realistically and as national symbols. It has become a national icon. Other painters have also depicted the scene, and even more than his other Norwegian landscapes, this one drove tourists to visit the site: the luxury hotel built at Stalheim in 1885 is attributable to it.\n", "\nArtist: Artemisia Gentileschi\nArtwork Name: Susanna and the Elders\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/artemisia-gentileschi/susanna-and-the-elders-1610\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSusanna and the Elders is a 1610-1 painting by the Italian artist Artemisia Gentileschi.

The topic of the canvas is taken from the Book of Judges, verses 4:11-22 and 5:24-31. It depicts the moment  in which a Kenite woman Jael is about to kill Sisera, a defeated Canaanite general. After his defeat by the Israelites he flees to a nearby settlement, where Jael takes him in, promises to feed him and hide him from the authorities. The moment he is asleep she drives a tent peg through his temple; an act that earned Jael praise for her courage in the biblical text. This subject is seldom depicted in seventeenth century art, there very few other examples contemporary to this painting. Historians believe that this may be due to the questionable morality of her actions, as compared to other biblical women.  While this story was less frequently portrayed in painting, historians believe that Artemisia's canvas was influenced by the work of Florentine artist Ludovico Cigoli. Her portrayal differs however, in the way that it develops a clear visual separation of the two figures, as opposed to Cigoli's compressed rendering. Jael's golden gown contrasts strongly with Sisera's red and blue garments, which is thought to signal her \"virtue and imminent victory.\"  The date, 1620 can be seen at the bottom of the Artist's prominent signature, carved in to the pillar.  The awkward placement of Jael's right hand is thought to have been deliberately designed to highlight the signature.  While the date places Artemisia in Rome, she signs this painting, \"Artemisia Lomi,\" suggesting a Florentine patron. While living and working in Florence, Artemisia adopted this surname, which belonged to one of her uncles, rather than the Roman Gentileschi, to strengthen her ties the city among her potential patrons.        Aside from this clue the source of patronage for this painting is unknown. The prominence of the artist's signature indicate that this was a work she felt worthy of praise. The three-line signature reads, \"ARETEMITA LOMI/FACIBAT/MDCXX.\" This is the first example of Artemisia using the imperfect tense of the Latin verb Facibat, perhaps a reference to the way in which Michelangelo signed his Pieta.   This painting was restored in 1978 by Veronika Ember. Prior to restoration the painting had extensive paint loss in the upper left and lower right hand corners. As a result of the restoration the highlights on Sisera skirt were strengthened and some of the shadows are more mechanical in nature than those you would expect to see by Artemisia's hand. The signature remained intact.  The work was first documented in the imperial collection in Vienna in 1781, upon its transfer to Bratislava Castle. Three years later, it was transferred to the Royal Palace in Buda, from where it may have been dispersed in 1856. The work appeared at auction in Budapest in 1974, at which point it was purchased by its current owners.

The oil-on-canvas painting measures 96.5 by 73.7 centimetres (38.0\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a029.0\u00a0in) and was probably produced during Gentileschi\u2019s stay in England between 1638 and 1639. It was in the collection of Charles I and was returned to the Royal Collection at the Restoration (1660) and remains there. In 2015 it was put on display in the \"Cumberland Gallery\" in Hampton Court Palace.\r The scene depicts Gentileschi painting herself, who is in turn represented as the \u201cAllegory of Painting\u201d illustrated by Cesare Ripa. It is now in the British Royal Collection.\r The painting demonstrates rare feminist themes from a time when women seldom held jobs, let alone were well known for them. Gentileschi\u2019s portrayal of herself as the epitome of the arts was a bold statement to make for the period. Though the painting is today overshadowed by many of Gentileschi\u2019s other, more dramatic and raw scenes reflecting the artist\u2019s troubling younger years, Self-Portrait was very controversial in its time.\r That it is a self-portrait as well as an allegory was first proposed by Michael Levey in the 20th century, and is not universally accepted, as some art historians see the features of the figure here as too different from those in other portraits of the artist.\r Gentileschi was born in Rome in 1593, just at the start of Baroque painting. Gentileschi\u2019s father, Orazio, was a well-known artist, and Artemisia trained in his workshop for a number of years before creating works herself. In the 1610s, Artemisia was raped by a somewhat older member of the workshop, Agostino Tassi, an event which coloured the rest of her life and is reflected in her art, which often shows subjects with a \"Power of Women\" themes such as Judith Slaying Holofernes and Salome with the Head of St. John the Baptist. The artist's focus on her work, away from the viewer, highlights the drama of the Baroque period, and the changing role of the artist from craftsperson to singular innovator.\r Abstract concepts like \"Painting\" were traditionally represented by female allegorical figures, and therefore the painting was not one that any male painter could present in the same way, as both self-portrait and allegory. The Self-Portrait was also influenced by the works of Cesare Ripa, most notably his Iconologia, in which he suggests how virtues and abstract concepts should be depicted, with human qualities and appearances. Ripa said \"Painting\" should be shown as: \u201cA beautiful woman, with full black hair, disheveled, and twisted in various ways, with arched eyebrows that show imaginative thought, the mouth covered with a cloth tied behind her ears, with a chain of gold at her throat from which hangs a mask, and has written in front \"imitation.\" She holds in her hand a brush, and in the other the palette, with clothes of evanescently covered drapery.\u201d Other than the cloth tied around the mouth, Gentileschi follows this prescription quite accurately.\n", "\nArtist: Pellizza da Volpedo\nArtwork Name: The Fourth State\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pellizza-da-volpedo/the-fourth-estate-1901\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Fourth Estate (Italian: Il quarto stato) is an oil painting by Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo, originally titled The Path of Workers and made between 1899 and 1901. It depicts a moment during a labor strike when workers' representatives calmly and confidently stride out of a crowd to negotiate for the workers' rights. Its name refers to the working class as standing alongside the three traditional estates that divided power between the nobility, clergy, and commoners.  Pellizza made three separate large-scale preliminary versions of the work to experiment with his divisionist representations of color. After his death, The Fourth Estate became a popular Italian socialist image and was reproduced extensively despite its initial shunning by formal art circles. Over time, its acclaim grew until it became recognized as one of the most important Italian paintings of the turn of the 20th century. The painting is now at the Museo del Novecento in Milan.    Following the Italian Risorgimento, the peasant and bourgeois classes of the new country had an uncertain relationship. Some bourgeois intellectuals bemoaned the lowering of Italian culture, while artists\u2014particularly the divisionists\u2014brought social themes into their artwork. Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo tried to unite the techniques of divisionism with the influence of the farmers' mutual aid society he had joined in his hometown of Volpedo and the socialist writings of the Second International.  Pellizza began to work on a study for Ambasciatori della Fame (Ambassadors of Hunger) in 1891, after participating in a workers' protest in Turin. The scene made such an impression on him that he noted it in his diary:  The first sketch was completed in April 1891. The subject was a workers' revolt in Piazza Malaspina in Volpedo, with three subjects placed at the front of the protest. The scene is viewed from above, and the figures are distributed on orthogonal lines. This core composition remained in successive versions of the work, each of which presents the three figures in front of a mass of people in the background and a dark backdrop. The shadow stretching out to the ambassador's feet is likely the palazzo on Piazza Malaspina, where the workers are going to make their demands.  Pellizza made numerous other intermediary works between the first drawing of Ambasciatori della Fame and Fiumana. He also made Piazza Malaspina a Volpedo in 1891, which represents the topography of Volpedo as a preparatory background for the subsequent versions. He made two other versions of Ambasciatori della Fame, one dated 1892 and the other 1895. The 1892 sketch is similar to the first. However, Pellizza added a group of women to the 1892 drawing, who are juxtaposed with the male workers.  The last draft before La Fiumana is the 1895 version of Ambasciatori, created after three quiet years on brown paper as a charcoal and gesso drawing. Pelliza wrote of it:   In the passage above, the artist underlined his wish to follow a general theory: not only to represent the citizens of Volpedo, but also an entire part of society that has \"suffered greatly\" and that intends to claim its rights through a struggle \"serene, calm, and reasoned.\"\n", "\nArtist: Francesco Hayez\nArtwork Name: The Sicilian Vespers (Version I)\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francesco-hayez/the-sicilian-vespers-version-i-1821\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Sicilian Vespers is the title of three works by the Italian artist Francesco Hayez, all showing the outbreak of the Sicilian Vespers.

It is possibly his best known work. This painting conveys the main features of Italian Romanticism and has come to represent the spirit of the Risorgimento. It was commissioned by Alfonso Maria Visconti di Saliceto, who donated to the Pinacoteca di Brera after his death.\r The painting represents a couple from the Middle Ages, embracing while they kiss each other. It is among the most passionate and intense representations of a kiss in the history of Western art. The girl leans backwards, while the man bends his left leg so as to support her, simultaneously placing a foot on the step next to him as though poised to go at any moment. The couple, though at the center of the painting, are not recognizable, as Hayez wanted the action of the kissing to be at the center of the composition. In the left part of the canvas shadowy forms lurk in the corner to give an impression of conspiracy and danger.\r This painting has been regarded as a symbol of Italian Romanticism, of which it encompasses many features. On a more superficial level, the painting is the representation of a passionate kiss, which puts itself in accordance with the principles of Romanticism. Therefore, it emphasizes deep feelings rather than rational thought, and presents a reinterpretation and reevaluation of the Middle Ages in a patriotic and nostalgic tone.\r On a deeper level, the painting aims to portray the spirit of the Risorgimento. The girl's pale blue dress signifies France, which in 1859 (the year of the painting's creation) made an alliance with the Kingdom of Piedmont and Sardinia, enabling the latter to unify the many states of the Italian peninsula into the new kingdom of Italy.\r This painting is notable for its vivid colors and textures, in particular the blue dress, which appears to be a beautiful silk which shimmers before the viewer's eyes.\r The Kiss has enjoyed extensive popularity from its exhibition onward, especially in Italy, and has been the subject of much commentary. In the 1920s the art director of Perugina, one of Italy's leading chocolate manufacturers, revised the image of the painting and created the typical blue box of the popular \"Baci\" chocolates with the picture of two lovers. In 1954 the great Italian director Luchino Visconti took inspiration from the painting for one of the leading scenes of his masterpiece movie, Senso.\n", "\nArtist: Domenico Induno\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Aleardo Aleardi\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/domenico-induno/portrait-of-aleardo-aleardi-1850\n\nWikipedia Article:\nAleardo Aleardi (14 November 1812\u00a0\u2013 17 July 1878), born Gaetano Maria, was an Italian poet who belonged to the so-called Neo-romanticists.  Aleardo was born in Verona in 1812, and took an active part in the movement of the Risorgimento. In 1848 he went to Paris, invited by Daniele Manin, to garner support for the Venetian Republic. He was arrested twice: at Mantua in 1852 and at Josephstadt in Bohemia in 1859. After the unification of Italy he became a member of parliament, then in 1873 a senator, and finally a professor of aesthetics at Florence, where he died in 1878.  Aleardo Aleardi - whose name was Gaetano Maria, then he turned into Aleardo - was born in Verona in 1812 by Maria Channels and Count Giorgio Aleardi. After studying law at the University of Padua together with friends John Meadows and Arnaldo Fusinato, he returned to Verona, interest in poetry and art criticism.Among his earliest compositions there are Marriage (1842), an exaltation of marriage as an expression of civilization, and the Arnalda Roca, in 1844, a poem that has historical protagonist a young woman who dies defending his honor: there is already in it the search for scenic effects and dramatic color that is typical of the entire production next dell'Aleardi.The first success was achieved in 1846 with the two Letters to Mary, in verse, in which the poet turns to friend proposing a platonic love: it is an opportunity to express his belief in the immortality of the soul and pour out his emotional suffering in a spirit of romanticism way.  Frequent visitor to the salon of Countess Anna Serego Gozzadini Alighieri, he courted the daughter Nina, dedicating numerous poems.

He was arrested in 1852 and imprisoned for several months in the fortress of Mantua was followed by a period of depression and, in 1855, the idyll Raphael and the Fornarina, where the affectation of the poem is likely to reach the poor taste.Often compared to the Meadows for the common languor sentimental, but to the subject, the luck dell'Aleardi declined at the end of the nineteenth century to get some recognition from the Cross, which he took over the sincerity of the poet in the forms of dubious taste and made him a precursor the pastures, and De Lollis, who saw in him the romantic poet of transition, torn between classicism and realism.

During his first stay in Domburg, Mondrian reportedly made sketches of an apple tree in the garden of the Villa Loverendale, the home of Marie Tak van Poortvliet and her friend, the painter Jacoba van Heemskerck. The painting was completed during a subsequent visit to Domburg.   It was exhibited twice during Mondrian's lifetime; the first time at the exhibition Schilderijen en teekeningen door C. Spoor, Piet Mondriaan en Jan Sluyters in the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam in 1909. In 1910 it was shown at the 20th annual exhibition of members of nl:Kunstenaarsvereniging Sint Lucas in Amsterdam. It was sold for 500 guilders to Marie Tak van Poortvliet. \n", "\nArtist: Piet Mondrian\nArtwork Name: The Gray Tree\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/piet-mondrian/the-gray-tree-1911\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGray Tree is an oil painting by Piet Mondrian. This painting was made in 1911 on canvas on a board measuring 78.5 \u00d7 107.5\u00a0cm. It is exhibited at Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, The Hague.\r The work came at a time when Mondrian was beginning to experiment with Cubism: its foreground and background elements seem to intermingle, and the palette is very restricted. The tree is subtly oval in form, following another Cubist practice seen in works by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Mondrian's oval became explicit, framing the work, in paintings that followed over the next three or four years. Apple Tree in Flower, also from 1912, is a similarly sized composition. Though the outline of the \"apple tree\" recalls that of Gray Tree, the work is significantly more faceted and abstract.\n", "\nArtist: Karl Bryullov\nArtwork Name: The Last Day of Pompeii\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/karl-bryullov/the-last-day-of-pompeii-1833\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Last Day of Pompeii is a large history painting by Karl Bryullov produced in 1830\u20131833 on the subject of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. It is notable for its positioning between Neoclassicism, the predominant style in Russia at the time, and Romanticism as increasingly practised in France. The painting was received to near universal acclaim and made Bryullov the first Russian painter to have an international reputation. In Russia it was seen as proving that Russian art was as good as art practised in the rest of Europe. Critics in France and Russia both noted, however, that the perfection of the classically modelled bodies seemed to be out of keeping with their desperate plight and the overall theme of the painting, which was a Romantic one of the sublime power of nature to destroy man's creations.\r The Roman city of Pompeii, south of Naples, was under active excavation in the early 19th century, work having begun on the city and its neighbour Herculaneum in the middle of the previous century. Artists were well aware of its potential as a subject. John Martin had painted The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum in 1822 and others had sketched and produced engravings of the site.\r In 1823, Bryullov arrived in Rome with his brother Aleksandr via Venice and Florence. Aleksandr was a participant in a scientific study and restoration of the Pompeii baths in 1825\u201326, which led to the publication of his book Thermes de Pomp\u00e9i in Paris in 1829, and Karl may have visited Pompeii in 1824. He saw Alessandro Sanquirico's set designs for Giovanni Pacini's opera L'ultimo giorno di Pompei (1825), which was performed at Naples and at La Scala, Milan, and visited the Naples museum to study artefacts recovered from Pompeii. He certainly visited Pompeii in 1827 and according to Rosalind Blakesley, was so affected by the remains of the Via dei Sepolcri (Street of the Tombs) that he decided to set his painting in that street. Contemporary letters indicate that he studied Pliny the Younger's eye-witness description of the disaster, in which Pliny's uncle died, and Pliny's observations in his letters to Tacitus were referenced in the picture. Also in literature, Bryullov read Alessandro Manzoni's novel I Promessi Sposi (The Betrothed) (1827) with its historically based account of a disastrous plague and the reactions to it of individuals.\r These sources coalesced into the work known as The Last Day of Pompeii for which Bryullov painted a compositional sketch in 1828 at the request of Countess Maria Razumovskaya. The main canvas was commissioned by Count Anatoly Demidov, whom Bryullov had met in Naples, and for whom he painted an equestrian portrait the same year. It was to be completed by 1830 for the sum of 40,000 francs, but by the end of that year Bryullov had only got as far as outlining the figures on the canvas in two colours and had given little attention to colour choices. A trip to Bologna and Venice to see work by Tintoretto and Titian gave him the answers he needed.\n", "\nArtist: Ivan Aivazovsky\nArtwork Name: The Ninth Wave\nArtwork Genre: marina\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/ivan-aivazovsky/the-ninth-wave-1850-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Ninth Wave (Russian: \u0414\u0435\u0432\u044f\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0430\u043b, Dyevyatiy val) is an 1850 painting by the Russian Armenian marine painter Ivan Aivazovsky.

Aivazovsky painted over 6,000 works, more than half of which are seascapes.\r It depicts three ships in close combat on a rough sea; as the name suggests, the battle occurs between two Turkish warships, and another ship referred to in the painting's title as the Russian brig Mercury. While Aivazovsky painted many seascapes, often involving ships and boats of various descriptions, and many showing ships that were damaged or shipwrecked, few of his works featured ships in close naval combat.\r The battle portrayed was part of the Russo-Turkish War of 1828\u20131829, a war sparked by the Greeks' struggle for independence and ensuing events. The Turkish sultan became hostile to the Russians due their participation in the Battle of Navarino and, as a result, proceeded to close the Dardanelles for Russian ships and revoked the 1826 Convention of Akkerman.\r Mercury was a real ship (a 20-gun brig) that was laid down at Sevastopol on 28 January 1819, and designed as a patrol ship to guard the Northern Caucasus coast. Built of Crimean oak, with a shallow draught and equipped with oars, Mercury was launched on 7 May 1820 and disassembled on 9 November 1857. In this it differs from other brigs of the Imperial Russian Navy at the time; other brigs were not built this way because a shallow draught limited and lowered the maximum speed considerably. Oars were also seen as disadvantageous. This difference resulted from the fact that its original task was considered unique among its designers.\r Mercury fought in several significant naval battles during its existence. One of the most notable of these battles involved a battle between Mercury (which was, at the time, commanded by Lieutenant Alexander Kazarsky) and two other brigs against a sizable complement of approximately 14 Turkish ships, who were returning from the shores of Anatolia. Turkish victory was at first foreseeable, but the tides of battle changed, and Mercury was able to escape after a final, powerful assault by the three brigs, ending the conflict.\r After the conflict had ended, one of the navigators of the Turkish ships made a comment commending Mercury for her seaworthiness, and the captain for his bravery:\n", "\nArtist: Ilya Repin\nArtwork Name: Barge Haulers on the Volga\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/ilya-repin/haulers-on-the-volga-1873\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBarge Haulers on the Volga or Burlaki (Russian: Burlaki na Volge, \u0411\u0443\u0440\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u0435) is an 1870\u201373 oil-on-canvas painting by the realist artist Ilya Repin. It depicts 11 men physically dragging a barge on the banks of the Volga River. They are at the point of collapse from exhaustion, oppressed by heavy, hot weather.\r The work is a condemnation of profit from inhumane labor. Although they are presented as stoical and accepting, the men are defeated; only one stands out: in the center of both the row and canvas, a brightly colored youth fights against his leather binds and takes on a heroic pose.\r Repin conceived the painting during his travels through Russia as a young man and depicts actual characters he encountered. It drew international praise for its realistic portrayal of the hardships of working men, and launched his career. Soon after its completion, the painting was purchased by Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich and exhibited widely throughout Europe as a landmark of Russian realist painting. Barge Haulers on the Volga has been described as \"perhaps the most famous painting of the Peredvizhniki movement [for]....its unflinching portrayal of backbreaking labor\".\r Repin was accepted into the Imperial Academy of Art in St. Petersburg in 1863. The academy at the time was known for its deep conservatism and leaning towards academic art, a fact that bred a sense of revolt and desire for change in many of its students.\r Barge Haulers was inspired by scenes witnessed by Repin while holidaying on the Volga in 1870. He made a number of preparatory studies, mostly in oil, while staying in Shiriaev Buerak, near Stavropol (Stavropol-na-Volge). The sketches include landscapes, and views of the Volga and barge haulers.\r The characters are based on actual people Repin came to know while preparing for the work. He had had difficulty finding subjects to pose for him, even for a fee, because of a folklorish belief that a subject's soul would leave his possession once his image was put down on paper. The subjects include a former soldier, a former priest, and a painter. Although he depicted eleven men, women also performed the work and there were normally many more people in a barge-hauling gang; Repin selected these figures as representative of a broad swathe of the working classes of Russian society. That some had once held relatively high social positions dismayed the young artist, who had initially planned to produce a far more superficial work contrasting exuberant day-trippers (which he himself had been) with the careworn burlaks. Repin found a particular empathy with Kanin, the defrocked priest, who is portrayed as the lead hauler and looks outwards towards the viewer. The artist wrote,\r Barge Haulers on the Volga shows a row of eleven male burlaks dragging a barge on the Volga River that must be pulled upstream against the current. The men are dressed in rags and bound with leather harnesses. They are rendered as mostly stoical, although in obvious physical discomfort, with their bodies bowed in toil. The scene is rendered in a white, silvery light which has been described as \"almost Venetian\". In earlier studies, it was dominated by blue tones.\n", "\nArtist: Ilya Repin\nArtwork Name: Religious Procession in Kursk\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/ilya-repin/krestny-khod-religious-procession-in-kursk-gubernia-1883\n\nWikipedia Article:\nReligious Procession in Kursk Province (also known as Easter Procession in the District of Kursk or A Religious Procession in Kursk Gubernia') (Russian: \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0445\u043e\u0434 \u0432 \u041a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0438) is a large oil on canvas painting by the Russian realist painter and sculptor Ilya Repin (1844\u20131930). Completed between 1880 and 1883, the work shows a seething, huddled mass attending the annual religious procession (crucession) carrying the famous icon Our Lady of Kursk from its home at the Korennaya Monastery to the nearby city of Kursk in western Russia.\r The procession is led through a dusty landscape by robed, Orthodox priests holding icons, festoons and banners over their heads. Behind them follow a crowd mostly of peasants, but ranging from beggars and cripples, police and military officers to figures from the provincial elite. Religious Procession led to controversy when first exhibited due to the icon being held by a man who appears to be drunk.\r The work is a continuation of Repin's social commentary in his work, and highlights perceived abuses by both church and state. He wrote of the work, \" am applying all of my insignificant forces to try to give true incarnation to my ideas; life around me disturbs me a great deal and gives me no peace \u2013 it begs to be captured on canvas...\"\r At the right, burly peasants carry a platform holding the icon inside an elaborate neo-classical case; only gleams of light reflecting off the gold riza icon-cover can be made out. Lines of peasants joining hands hold back the crowd, the foremost at the left trying to stop the crippled boy breaking through the cordon with his stick. Alongside ride peasant or priest stewards and officials and police in uniform, some of the latter beating back the crowd with their riding crops. Behind the icon follow priests and better-dressed people, carrying icons in front of their chest, and an \"effete, dandified and bored priest\" in vestments carefully straightens his hair. There is a comic effect with a stout middle-aged woman in a yellow dress and bonnet carrying an icon behind him, who looks very like a priest in his vestments. An empty icon-case, presumably that of the icon carried by the wealthy woman behind, is carried with as much reverence as the icon itself. The hillside at right appears to have been recently cleared of timber, with fresh tree stumps. Further back another platform, holding what appears to be a circular icon, is preceded by two large banners, and behind that a large processional cross can be made out through the cloud of dust.\r The Procession is representative of Repin's style from the period, in that it first appears to be a scene from everyday life in Russia. In fact, it pointedly shows people from a range of social strata united and moving collectively towards their destination at Korennaya.\r The painting was highly popular, but controversial. The journal publishing a favourable review by the leading critic Vladimir Stasov published an editorial in the next issue dissociating itself from his views, and a second review by the editor. Stasov had made much of the violence of the riders to the crowd. Apart from Leo Tolstoy, who praised the painting and regarded it as neutral in its depiction of the social system, all were agreed that it was hostile to the established social order. Another reviewer noted with disapproval the \"undesirables who thronged around it at exhibition, noting a preponderance of liberated women with short haircuts, nihilistic young men, and a strong Jewish element; the chief characters of Imperial xenophobia\".\n", "\nArtist: Ilya Repin\nArtwork Name: Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan on November 16, 1581\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/ilya-repin/ivan-the-terrible-and-his-son-ivan-on-november-16-1581-1885\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan on 16 November 1581 is a painting by Russian realist artist Ilya Repin made between 1883 and 1885.  The picture portrays a grief-stricken Ivan the Terrible cradling his mortally wounded son, the Tsarevich Ivan  Ivanovich.  The elder Ivan himself is believed to have dealt the fatal blow to his son.  The work is variously referred to as Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan, with or without the date, or Ivan the Terrible Killing His Son.  Repin's painting has been called one of Russia's most famous paintings, and is also one of its most controversial. It has been vandalised twice, in 1913 and again in 2018.  The artist used Grigoriy Myasoyedov, his friend and fellow artist, as the model for Ivan the Terrible, with writer Vsevolod Garshin modelling for the Tsarevich. In 1885, upon completion of the oil on canvas work, Repin sold it to Pavel Tretyakov, for display in his gallery. It remains on display in the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow.  In his memoirs, Repin said he was inspired to create the painting by the 1881 assassination of Tsar Alexander II, the music of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and the bullfighting he had witnessed in 1883.   The work is a large canvas, 199.5 by 254 centimetres (78.5\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a0100.0\u00a0in).  The figures of Ivan and his son are depicted in a darkened room, with a blood red carpet.  Ivan wears an austere black coat, contrasting with the more extravagant pink satin dressing gown and teal green boots worn by his son. The room is furnished with 17th century furniture and objects, which themselves reflect the violence that has been done: a chair is overturned; the rug is bunched up by the Tsarevich's feet.  Although one version of the title of the painting is Ivan the Terrible Killing His Son, the work does not depict Ivan the Terrible delivering a fatal blow, but rather the Tsar holding the Tsarevich in his arms, his face a mask of horror and despair, attempting to staunch the flow of blood from his son's temple. It probably dawns on the mentally unstable monarch that, by killing his son, he planted the seed for the Time of Troubles and the demise of his dynasty (as his only remaining heir is a dim-witted younger son who would be easily manipulated by powerful boyars).  Differences between Repin's sketches and his final work indicate a distancing of the Tsar from the attack on the Tsarevich: in early versions, Ivan the Terrible is holding the sceptre used to deliver the blow, but the instrument is left out of the completed work.  The work is disturbing in the power of the emotions shown and in its \"gory representation of violence\". Repin later said of the time when he painted it, that \"A trail of blood ran through that year... Terrible scenes were in everybody's mind.\"  The composition reflects two paintings by Rembrandt which Repin had studied and admired at the Hermitage, The Return of the Prodigal Son and David and Jonathan.\n", "\nArtist: Ilya Repin\nArtwork Name: The Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks to Sultan Mahmoud IV\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/ilya-repin/the-reply-of-the-zaporozhian-cossacks-to-sultan-mahmoud-iv-1891\n\nWikipedia Article:\nReply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks to Sultan Mehmed IV of the Ottoman Empire, also known as Cossacks of Saporog Are Drafting a Manifesto (Ukrainian: \u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0446\u0456 \u043f\u0438\u0448\u0443\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0446\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0441\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0443), is a painting by Russian artist Ilya Repin.

Its background is a mountainous area in a scarlet sunset. The composition emphasizes the constraint of the demon's figure, as if pressed between the upper and lower bars of the frame. The painting is created in Vrubel's unique style with the effect of crystal edges, which makes his paintings look like stained glass or panels. That effect was achieved with plain strokes made with a painting knife.\r In 1900, Vrubel approached the theme of \"Demons\" again. Having not yet finished the piece The Demon Flying (1900), in 1901 the painter started drawing preliminary sketches for the painting The Demon Downcast. As Vladimir von Meck recalled,\r Vrubel suddenly sent a note to von Meck asking to send photos of the Caucasian mountains: \u201cI won\u2019t fall asleep until I get them!\u201d Upon receiving photos of Elbrus and Kazbek soon afterward, that night behind the demon\u2019s back grew pearl-coloured peaks, \u201cfanned with the eternal cold of death\u201d. While Vrubel was considered sane in general, people around him noted his irritability. Despite the mainly negative responses of contemporary critics, his popularity among painting lovers grew over time. In autumn of 1901, his spouse Nadezhda Zabela wrote to her sister:\r The Demon Downcast was finished in December of 1901 and displayed for several days in Moscow as an unfinished painting.\r In early 1902, The Demon Downcast was brought from Moscow to an exhibition organized by the society \u201cMir Iskusstva\u201d in Saint Petersburg. The painting made a real sensation. While the exposition was held, Vrubel came to this painting every morning, and until the noon, while there were few visitors, he redrew the demon, wiped away and imposed dyes, changed the figure\u2019s pose and the background, but most changes were made in the demon\u2019s face. Alexandre Benois, who had observed Vrubel\u2019s attempts to change the finished painting, wrote:\r Vladimir von Meck, one of the organizers of the exhibition, and his uncle Nikolai acquired many canvases of Vrubel's. This included a variant of Demon, when in 1902 the board of directors of the Tretyakov Gallery decided to not buy it. Later, in 1908, the Demon was sold to Tretyakov Gallery, where it is situated until now, being its most prominent exhibit. In early 1902, people around Vrubel began to notice symptoms of a developing mental disorder in him. His wife told her sister Ekaterina Ge about that as follows:\r Finally, they had to institutionalize Vrubel with a mania. The painter would imagine himself as Christ, then Pushkin, and then believed he would become the General-Governor of Moscow; then he turned into the Russian sovereign, and then he suddenly became Skobelev or Phryne. He heard choirs of voices, claimed to have lived in the Renaissance age and painted walls in the Vatican together with Raphael and Michelangelo. Vrubel was examined by the psychiatrist Vladimir Bekhterev who first discovered the painter's mental disorder.\r The image of a demon often appears in Mikhail Vrubel\u2019s art. In 1890 he drew the painting The Demon Seated. In 1899 he created The Demon Flying where the demon is depicted as a mighty ruler of the world.\n", "\nArtist: Valentin Serov\nArtwork Name: Girl with Peaches\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/valentin-serov/girl-with-peaches-1887\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGirl with Peaches (Russian: \u0414\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0441 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438, Devochka s Persikami) is an 1887 painting by the Russian painter Valentin Serov.\r It is considered to be one of Serov's greatest works and one of his most famous.

According to the book 1000 Drawings of Genius, although the style of the painting (and Serov's early style in general) \"has much in common with the French Impressionists, [Serov] did not become acquainted with their work until after he had painted [it]\".\r The painting depicts 12-year-old Vera Mamontova, a daughter of Russian entrepreneur and patron of the arts Savva Mamontov.\r It was painted at Abramtsevo, an estate not far from Moscow. By the time Mamontov had bought the place from writer Sergei Aksakov in 1870, Abramtsevo had become one of the centers of Russian culture. He continued the tradition. Among people who stayed there were painter Ilya Repin, writer Ivan Turgenev, painter Mikhail Vrubel, and sculptor Mark Antokolsky. It was a comfortable place for artists not only to gather and discuss important topics, but to live and create.\r Valentin Serov knew Vera Mamontova from her babyhood, as he frequently visited Mamontov's Abramtsevo estate, sometimes even lived there for lengthy periods of time.\r Serov later recalled,\r In 1887 the painting won first prize at the Exhibition of the Moscow Society of Lovers of Art.\r The model, Vera Mamontova, married the head of the Moscow Nobility League, future Chief Prosecutor of the Most Holy Synod Alexander Dmitrievich Samarin\u00a0(ru) in 1903. They had three children. In 1907, at the age of 32, she contracted pneumonia and died just a few days later.

To either side are arranged groups of angels directing the attention to the central scene, dominated by the symbol of the Christianity Trinity and Godhead: an equilateral triangle inscribed with the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew. Because the various groups are situated at different altitudes, the final impression is rather static, dominated by a composition in the shape of an \"X\", the result of Goya's intention to have the lines of force coming in from the corners and crossing in the centre.\r Various sketches and preparatory drawings for the work have been preserved which display more accomplishment than the painting on the cupola shows in actuality, although it must be borne in mind that the fresco has been restored no less than four times, in 1887, 1947, 1967 and 1991.

This series of paintings was specifically made in order to be transformed into tapestries that would be hung on the walls of the Royal Palace of El Pardo in Madrid, Spain. The tapestries showed serene events in everyday life, which made them a nice addition to the dining room of Prince and Princess of Asturias\u2014the future King Charles IV and Maria Luisa of Parma. The queen called on Goya because she wanted to decorate the dining room with cheerful scenes; The Parasol and the other tapestry paintings were Goya's response to this request. The painting is currently located in the Museo del Prado in Madrid as is another in the series, Blind man's bluff.\r On July 25, 1773, Goya married Josefa, the sister of Francisco Bayeu. Bayeu was a member of the Royal Academy of Fine Art and helped Goya to secure his place with the Royal Tapestry Workshop. He designed 42 patterns in five years that would soon insulate and decorate the walls of the Palacio Real de El Pardo. This series of tapestries demonstrated Goya's talent enough to give him access to the Royal Court, and drastically change his career. Goya went on to expand his patrons and paint for many royal court members, such as the Count of Floridablanca, of whom he painted a portrait under commission. This all led up to the peak of Goya's career, during the reign of Charles IV, right after the French revolution. He saw a painting of Big Ben\r In his paintings, Goya often joins French fashion to the Spanish one. The woman in this particular painting is sitting on the ground, possibly resting from a long walk. She is dressed in French style, according to the time period. She is holding a fan in her right hand, while a little dog is cuddled in her lap. The young man is holding the parasol (umbrella) in order to shade the woman's face. He is dressed in the so-called majo style, meaning he is dressed like a poor person for the time period. His hair gathered in a net, and his belt is made of colorful silk. In the background we can see dark clouds in the sky and the trees swaying in the wind, possibly signaling a storm coming. The painting has very calm warmth it emits, which is then offset by the tree that seems to be blowing in pretty strong wind. The way the boy is standing, with one foot on the rock and one not, he seems to be triumphantly shading the woman from the harmful rays of the sun, and the possible storm.\r From 1775 to 1792 Goya painted his cartoons (designs) for the tapestries. This was his first genre of paintings and possibly the most important period in his artistic development. Painting the tapestries helped Goya become a keen observer of human behavior, which helped him paint his future paintings. Goya was influenced by neoclassicism, which was gaining favor over the rococo style at the time. This particular painting is considered classicism for its relation to everyday life. Around this same time, Goya began painting portraits for many of the Spanish Monarchs. This was his first popular success that ultimately changed his career. He was then elected to the Royal Academy of San Fernando in 1780, named painter to the king in 1786, and made a court painter in 1789.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Crucified Christ\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/crucified-christ-1780\n\nWikipedia Article:\nChrist Crucified (Cristo crucificado) is a 1780 painting of the Crucifixion of Jesus by Francisco de Goya. He presented it to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando as his entry work as an academician. It now forms part of the permanent collection of the Prado Museum.\r The painting is neoclassical in style, though rooted in traditional Spanish iconography of the subject and related to the treatment of the same topic by Vel\u00e1zquez (even borrowing its dark black background with no landscape) and Anton Raphael Mengs (borrowing his presentation of the right leg pushed forwards). Goya conforms to the Spanish Baroque iconographic rules for portraying the Crucifixion as laid down by Francisco Pacheco \u2013 the black background, four rather than three nails, supported feet and a trilingual inscription at the top of the cross beginning IESUS NAZARENUS REX IUDEORUM. By obeying these rules Goya diminished the emphasis on devotional features such as drama and the presence of blood in order to concentrate attention on the painting's soft modelling, since his intention was to please the academicians then dominated by Mengs' neoclassicism.\r Painted with loose and vibrant brushwork, Christ's head is lifted and leaning to the left, dramatically looking upwards, possibly in a representation of a gesture of ecstasy as he said \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" (Matthew 27:46, Mark 15:34), though the serenity of the painting as a whole avoids a pitiful sensation.\r With this work Goya also aimed to show the academicians his work in one of the most difficult areas he could \u2013 his knowledge of anatomy \u2013 by submitting a nude, justified by its presentation in a religious guise that conformed with Spanish tradition. Goya cleverly resolves the difficulty of soft modelling in sfumato as well as the light source (which seems to come from Christ's bared breast) and its transition into the dark areas, hiding the outlines of his underdrawing. Transparent areas, glazes and gradations are treated with delicacy in shades of pearl gray and soft green-blue, and touches of intense white enhance the flashes of light. The lines of the composition conform to the sweet classical S, dispensing with the violent effects of the Baroque. The pushed-forward right leg, slightly skewed hip and the tilt of the head give the work dynamic adjustment as demanded by the classical canons to avoid stiffness.\r As much as his contemporaries admired the painting, it fell out of fashion in the 20th century, when critics preferred to see Goya as a Romantic painter with little or no Catholic faith who paid scant attention to academic or religious painting. However, postmodernism has assessed Goya and his work as a whole, in all its facets, and has taken into account that this is a work in which Goya was still striving for professional prestige.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Don Manuel Osorio Manrique de Zuniga\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/don-manuel-osorio-manrique-de-zuniga\n\nWikipedia Article:\nManuel Osorio Manrique de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga is a portrait painting by Francisco Goya.

Altamira held many titles and was also a director of the Banco de San Carlos. In 1786, after painting several portraits of the court, Goya was nominated painter to Charles III. This painting, from 1787\u201388, is of his youngest son, Manuel, who was born in April 1784 and died at age eight on June 12, 1792.\r Manuel is dressed in a red costume. He holds a string attached to his pet magpie, who is holding a calling card of the painter. On his left is a cage of finches. Three cats are intently watching the magpie on his right.\r The pets in this portrait have been analyzed in many different ways. The caged birds may symbolize the soul, the cats may be an evil force. For example, Goya shows a cat among the creatures in The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters, part of The Caprices.\r In 1926, Kathryn Bache Miller fell in love with this painting while at the Paris art gallery of Joseph Duveen. Her father, Jules Bache, then purchased it for $275,000. The painting was hung prominently in her living room. Her interior decorator, Billy Baldwin, described her attachment to it as if it were a living being. Her father bequeathed the painting to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but it was allowed to be shown periodically in Miller's apartment until she died in 1979.\r From April 22 to August 3, 2014, the museum reunited Manuel with his parents in the exhibit Goya and the Altamira Family.

Today it is held in the Museo L\u00e1zaro Galdiano, Madrid.\r It was purchased in 1798 along with five other paintings related to witchcraft by the Duke and Duchess of Osuna. The acquisition of the witchcraft paintings is attributed to the duchess rather than her husband, but it is not known whether they were commissioned or bought after completion. In the twentieth century the painting was purchased by the financier Jos\u00e9 L\u00e1zaro Galdiano and donated to the Spanish state on his death.\r Witches' Sabbath shows the devil in the form of a garlanded goat, surrounded by a coven of disfigured, young and aging witches in a moonlit barren landscape. The goat possesses large horns and is crowned by a wreath of oak leaves. An old witch holds an infant in her hands. The devil seems to be acting as priest at an initiation ceremony for the child, though popular superstition at the time believed the devil often fed on children and human fetuses. The skeletons of two infants can be seen; one discarded to the left, the other held by a crone in the centre foreground.\r Typical of the imagery of witchcraft, many of the symbols used are inverted. The goat extends his left rather than right hoof towards the child, while the quarter moon faces out of the canvas at the top left corner. In the middle high-ground, a number of bats can be seen flying overhead, their flocking motion echoing the curve of the crescent moon.\r Goya used the imagery of covens of witches in a number of works, most notably in one of his Black Paintings, Witches' Sabbath or The Great He-Goat (1821\u20131823).\r Interest in the supernatural was a feature of Romanticism, and is to be found for example in Weber's opera Der Freisch\u00fctz. However, in a Spanish context, Goya's paintings have been seen as a protest against those who upheld and enforced the values of the Spanish Inquisition, which had been active in Witch hunting during the seventeenth-century Basque witch trials. The later Witches Sabbath was painted as a bitter struggle raged between liberals and those in favour of a church and a royalist-lead state, which culminated in the so-called Ominous Decade (1823-1833). Both paintings can be seen as an attack on the superstitious beliefs rife in Spain during a period when tales of midnight gatherings of witches and the appearance of the devil were commonplace among the rural populace. They reflect the artist's disdain for the popular tendency towards superstition and the church-led return to medieval fears. Goya's depictions of such scenes mocked what he saw as medieval fears exploited by the established order for political and capital gain.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Procession of Flagellants\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/procession-of-flagellants-1793\n\nWikipedia Article:\nA Procession of Flagellants (Procesi\u00f3n de disciplinantes, or Procesi\u00f3n de flagelantes) is an oil-on-panel painting produced by Francisco de Goya between 1812 and 1819. In the foreground is a procession of Roman Catholic men dressed in white, wearing pointed hats and whipping their bared backs in penitence. Their backs are bleeding and they pull over-life-size statues of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora dela Soledad, the Ecce Homo and the Crucifixion of Christ. Other devotees, who are kneeling and wearing black hoods, line the route. On the right a man is impaled and all are carrying banners, crosses and lamps.\r The painting belongs to a series which also includes The Inquisition Tribunal, The Madhouse and The Bullfight. This series illustrates aspects of Spanish life which liberals (of whom Goya was then one) wished to reform but whose reform was opposed by Ferdinand VII of Spain's absolutist policy. A common feature of the series is the presence of cruelty, here shown by the blood flowing out onto the white garment of the central figure, and two contrasting zones of light and dark \u2013 here, all the figures in the foreground are in the light, well-characterised and individualised, but the background is left as an anonymous crowd of the faithful, dimly lit under a cloudy blue sky. The two zones are divided by a dark wall, possibly symbolising the heavy weight of religion.\r The series played an important part in creating the legend of 'Black Spain'. It does not go beyond the usual point of view on the Spanish mindset of its era among most other Europeans, interested in Spain as an exotic and picturesque land, an interest first aroused by the French contact with Spain that led to the Peninsular War. Paintings such as these, with a terrible and romantic aura, inspired several later prints.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: The Yard of a Madhouse\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: oil,tin\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/the-yard-of-a-madhouse-1794\n\nWikipedia Article:\nYard with Lunatics (Spanish: Corral de locos) is a small oil-on-tinplate painting completed by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya between 1793 and 1794. Goya said that the painting was informed by scenes of institutions he had witnessed as a youth in Zaragoza. Yard with Lunatics was painted around the time when Goya\u2019s deafness and fear of mental illness were developing and he was increasingly complaining of his health. A contemporary diagnosis read, \"the noises in his head and deafness aren\u2019t improving, yet his vision is much better and he is back in control of his balance.\"\r Though Goya had to that point been preoccupied with commissioned portraits of royalty and noblemen, this work is one of a dozen small-scale, dark images he produced independently. Uncommissioned, it was one of the first of Goya's mid-1790s cabinet paintings, in which his earlier search for ideal beauty gave way to an examination of the relationship between naturalism and fantasy that would preoccupy him for the rest of his career. He was undergoing a nervous breakdown and entering prolonged physical illness, and admitted that the series was created to reflect his own self-doubt, anxiety and fear that he himself was going mad. Goya wrote that the works served \"to occupy my imagination, tormented as it is by contemplation of my sufferings.\" The series, he said, consisted of pictures which \"normally find no place in commissioned works.\"\r To art historian Arthur Danto, Yard with Lunatics marks a point in Goya's career where he moves from \"a world in which there are no shadows to one in which there is no light\". The work is often compared to more mature but equally bleak Madhouse of 1812-19. It has been described as a \"somber vision of human bodies without human reason\", as one of Goya's \"deeply disturbing visions of sadism and suffering\", and a work that marks his progression from a commissioned portraitist to an artist that pursued only his bleak and pitiless view of humanity.\r Some historians speculate that Goya's symptoms may indicate prolonged viral encephalitis; and the mixture of tinnitus, imbalance and progressive deafness may be symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. Others claim that he was suffering from mental illness. However, these attempts at posthumous diagnosis are purely, and only, speculative and hypothetical. Goya's diagnosis remains unknown. What is known, is that he lived in fear of insanity, and projected his fears and despair into his work.\r Set in a Lunatic asylum, Yard with Lunatics was painted at a time when such institutions were, according to art critic Robert Hughes, no more than \"holes in the social surface, small dumps into which the psychotic could be thrown without the smallest attempt to discover, classify, or treat the nature of their illness.\" Goya's yard is overwhelmingly stark, showing shackled inmates enclosed by high walls and a heavy stone arch. Inmates fight and grin idiotically or huddle in despair, all bathed in an oppressive grey and green light, guarded by a single man. The work stands as a horrifying and imaginary vision of loneliness, fear and social alienation, a departure from the rather more superficial treatment of mental illness in the works of earlier artists such as Hogarth.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: The Duchess of Alba and Her Duenna\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/the-duchess-of-alba-and-her-duenna-1795\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Duchess of Alba and \"la Beata\" (or The Duchess of Alba and the Pious Woman; Spanish: La duquesa de Alba y su due\u00f1a o La Duquesa de Alba y \"la Beata\") is a small 1795 oil on canvas painting by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya.\r It portrays the Duchess Mar\u00eda Cayetana de Silva, 13th Duchess of Alba reaching playfully towards her maid (or duena) Rafaela Luisa Velazquez (known as \"la Beata\"), who leans away.

Goya had earlier been court painter to Charles III, who was widely viewed as the more astute political operator of the pair. While not lacking intelligence, Carlos IV is broadly seen as an idler compared to his father; ultimately he was outmaneuvered by Napoleon at a time when he was more interested in sport and hunting than affairs of state.\r While Goya devotes a great deal of attention to his depiction of the king's sash and cloth, he emphasises his weakness in his rendering of a near-portly belly and indecisive stare. The art critic Robert Hughes describes a \"big nosed face, framed in the tricorned hat like the head of an affable turtle poking from its shell\". During his career, Goya depicted both father and son in hunting dress. The inspiration for the older man's outfit is probably taken from Vel\u00e1zquez's portrait of Philip IV, which the artist would have opportunity to see as then court painter. Goya pays tribute to Titian's Portrait of Charles V with a dog by depicting a dog loyally sniffing at the royal crotch.\r Goya had painted Carlos IV's father in 1780, when the artist himself was a young man. Although few of his thoughts survive for art historians, it is generally believed that the sentiment of later works such as Charles IV of Spain and His Family lend credence to the theory that he held his weakling King in little regard. Charles IV is rendered as portly and sightly confused, seemingly more suited to the role of country gentleman than regal, absolute head.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Charles IV of Spain and his family\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/charles-iv-of-spain-and-his-family-1800\n\nWikipedia Article:\nCharles IV of Spain and His Family is an oil on canvas painting by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya who began work on this painting in 1800 and completed it in the summer of 1801. It features life sized depictions of Charles IV of Spain and his family, ostentatiously dressed in fine costume and jewelry. The painting was modeled after Vel\u00e1zquez's Las Meninas when setting the royal subjects in a naturalistic and plausible setting.\r The royal family is apparently paying a visit to the artist's studio, while Goya can be seen to the left looking outwards towards the viewer. As in \"Las Meninas,\" the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible; however, the atmospheric and warm perspective of the palace interior of Vel\u00e1zquez's work is replaced in the Goya by a sense of, in the words of Gassier, \"imminent suffocation\" as the royal family are presented by Goya on a \"stage facing the public, while in the shadow of the wings the painter, with a grim smile, points and says: 'Look at them and judge for yourself!'\"\r The barely visible man in the background shadows at the left is Goya himself (2). Others are, left to right:\r The French writer Theophile Gautier called it a 'picture of the corner grocer who has just won the lottery' and it has sometimes been believed that Goya was in some way satirising his subjects. The idea has been dismissed however by the art critic Robert Hughes\u00a0; 'This is nonsense. You didn't manage to keep your job as an official court portraitist if you were satirising the people you were painting. No, this is not a send up. If anything it is an act of flattery. For instance on the left, in the blue suit, is one of the most odious little toads in the entire history of Spanish politics, the future King Ferdinand VII, whom Goya actually manages to make quite regal. God knows how he did it, but he has. This is very much an act of respect, almost verging on an act of flattery.\" \n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Nude Maja\nArtwork Genre: nude painting (nu)\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/nude-maja-1800\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Nude Maja (Spanish: La Maja Desnuda [la \u02c8maxa \u00f0ez\u02c8nu\u00f0a]) is a name given to a c. 1797\u20131800 oil on canvas painting by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya. It portrays a nude woman reclining on a bed of pillows, and was probably commissioned by Manuel de Godoy, to hang in his private collection in a separate cabinet reserved for nude paintings. Goya created a pendant of the same woman identically posed, but clothed, known today as La maja vestida (The Clothed Maja); also in the Prado, it is usually hung next to La maja desnuda. The subject is identified as a maja based on her costume in La maja vestida.\r The painting is renowned for the straightforward and unashamed gaze of the model towards the viewer. It has also been cited as among the earliest Western artwork to depict a nude woman's pubic hair without obvious negative connotations (such as in images of prostitutes). With this work Goya not only upset the ecclesiastical authorities, but also titillated the public and extended the artistic horizon of the day. It has been in the Museo del Prado in Madrid since 1901.\r Although the two versions of the Maja are the same size, the sitter in the clothed version occupies a slightly larger proportion of the pictorial space; according to art historian Janis Tomlinson she seems almost to \"press boldly against the confines of her frame\", making her ironically more brazen in comparison to the comparatively \"timid\" nude portrait.\r The painting carries many of the traditions of depictions of the nude in Spanish art, but marks a clear break in significant ways, especially in her bold gaze. Further, the accompanying pendant showing a woman in contemporary dress makes it clear that the focus of the work is not of a mythological subject, as in Vel\u00e1zquez's Rokeby Venus, but in fact of a nude Spanish woman. More obviously, while Vel\u00e1zquez painted his Venus revealing only her back, Goya's portrait is a full frontal view. Goya's figuration is short and angular, while Vel\u00e1zquez's is elongated and curved, and his figure placed on richly coloured satin, which starkly contrasts to the bare white cloths Goya's maja rests on.\r The identity of the model and why the paintings were created are unknown. Both paintings are first recorded in an inventory of unpopular and unsuccessful art by Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy, Duke of Alc\u00fadia in 1800, when they were hung in a private room reserved for nude paintings, alongside such works as Vel\u00e1zquez's Rokeby Venus. Godoy retained the picture for six years before it was discovered by investigators for the Spanish Inquisition in 1808, along with his other \"questionable pictures\". Godoy and the curator of his collection, Don Francisco de Garivay, were brought before a tribunal and forced to reveal the artists behind the confiscated art works which were \"so indecent and prejudicial to the public good.\"\r The controversy was populist and driven by a political motive, following a mob gathering demanding Godoy's removal as Prime Minister. In the fallout, Goya was named and summoned on a charge of moral depravity. As Godoy had only been found in possession of the painting, Goya was asked to identify why \"he did them\", and also \"at whose request, and what attention guided him.\" His answers do not survive, but we know that the Director of Confiscations noted that Goya had only followed and emulated Titian's Dana\u00eb series and Vel\u00e1zquez's Venus; two painters, and their works, very much admired by the court and church, including their nudes, and the Inquisition has up to that time not found anything objectionable in the latter's Rokeby Venus.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: The Clothed Maja\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/the-clothed-maja-1800\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Clothed Maja (Spanish: La maja vestida [la \u02c8maxa \u03b2es\u02c8ti\u00f0a]) is a pendant painting by the Spanish painter Francisco de Goya between 1800 and 1805.

The portrait depicts Isabel Lobo Velasco de Porcel, who was born at Ronda around 1780 and was the second wife of Antonio Porcel. Isabel's husband was 25 years older than she, and they met when she was 20 years old. Antonio Porcel was a liberal and associate of Manuel Godoy, Prince of the Peace, who was a friend of Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, who in turn brought him in contact with Goya, who lived nearby; the painting is said to have been a gift from the artist in return for hospitality. A Goya portrait of Antonio Porcel, though much larger and so not a matching piece, was lost in a fire when the Jockey Club in Buenos Aires was destroyed in a riot in 1953.\r The half-length portrait depicts a young woman dressed in typical Spanish attire, a white shirt and a black mantilla. In spite of her \"maja\" attire, the richness of the textiles and her ladylike appearance give the picture an aristocratic elegance; at this time wealthy Spanish \"people of fashion\" often wore the styles of lower class urban dandies and their female equivalents, as seen in Goya's famous clothed version of La Maja.\r The decisive gesture of her arms in the akimbo position and her confidence stand out. Her eyes and hair are light brown, her skin is pale, and her body is slightly turned to the left side, while her head gives balance by being turned to the opposite side. Goya achieves realism and deepness without adding secondary objects to the composition.

It is a painting traditionally attributed to Francisco de Goya that shows a giant in the centre of the canvas walking towards the left hand side of the picture. Mountains obscure his legs up to his thighs and clouds surround his body; the giant appears to be adopting an aggressive posture as he is holding one of his fists up at shoulder height. A dark valley containing a crowd of people and herds of cattle fleeing in all directions occupies the lower third of the painting.\r The painting became the property of Goya's son, Javier Goya, in 1812. The painting was later owned by Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez Dur\u00e1n, who bequeathed his collection to Madrid's Museo del Prado, where it has been kept since 1931.\r The painting became part of the Museo del Prado's collection in 1931, when it was donated by the estate of Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez Dur\u00e1n. The first documented attribution of the painting to Goya dates from 1946 when Francisco Javier S\u00e1nchez Cant\u00f3n published the inventory of the estate of Josefa Bayeu, Goya's wife, on her death in 1812. The inventory describes a painting of \"a giant\" with the same measurements as The Colossus, which was identified with an X (Xavier Goya) and the number 18.\r The painting was passed into the ownership of Miguel Fern\u00e1ndez Dur\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez de Pinedo y Bizarr\u00f3n, Marquis of Perales, as he left it to his great-grandson, Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez Dur\u00e1n on his death in 1833. The painting is listed in the notarised estate of Paula Bernaldo de Quir\u00f3s (Marchioness of Perales and Tolosa and mother of Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez Dur\u00e1n) on her death in 1877. At this time the painting was described as \"A prophetic allegory of the misfortunes that took place during the War of Independence, Goya original, measuring 1.15 by 1.[0]3 (global measurement units) ( having a value of one thousand five hundred pesetas\".\r More recently, the questions raised regarding the authorship of The Colossus and its absence from the Prado's exhibition Goya in wartime have focussed attention on, among other matters, Goya's etching of the same theme, which was included in the same exhibition (exhibition catalogue number 28). In an article entitled \"Artistic technique as a research method relating to Goya's 'The Colossus'\" (in the journal Goya \u2116 324) Jesusa Vega established the relationship between the etching known as The Giant (of which there is second copy in the Spanish National Library in Madrid) and The Colossus in these words: \"the giant, moves from resistance / defence, proud and erect, to slumped melancholy, reflecting the mood of many Spaniards, a collective feeling shared by its creator\". If the painting is attributed as being painted between 1808\u2014the start of the Peninsular War\u2014and 1812\u2014when the painting is recorded as being among the goods divided between Goya and his son Javier\u2014then the print should be dated as originating after the end of the war due to the technique and materials used in the series of etchings The Disasters of War.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: A Prison Scene\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: oil,zinc\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/a-prison-scene-1814\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPrison Interior (Spanish: Interior de c\u00e1rcel) is an oil on canvas painting completed by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya (1746\u20131828) between 1793-94.

In the work, Goya sought to commemorate Spanish resistance to Napoleon's armies during the occupation of 1808 in the Peninsular War. Along with its companion piece of the same size, The Second of May 1808 (or The Charge of the Mamelukes), it was commissioned by the provisional government of Spain at Goya's suggestion.\r The painting's content, presentation, and emotional force secure its status as a groundbreaking, archetypal image of the horrors of war. Although it draws on many sources from both high and popular art, The Third of May 1808 marks a clear break from convention. Diverging from the traditions of Christian art and traditional depictions of war, it has no distinct precedent, and is acknowledged as one of the first paintings of the modern era. According to the art historian Kenneth Clark, The Third of May 1808 is \"the first great picture which can be called revolutionary in every sense of the word, in style, in subject, and in intention\".\r The Third of May 1808 has inspired a number of other major paintings, including a series by \u00c9douard Manet, and Pablo Picasso's Massacre in Korea and Guernica.\r Napoleon I of France declared himself First Consul of the French Republic on November 10, 1799, and crowned himself Emperor in 1804. Because Spain controlled access to the Mediterranean, the country was politically and strategically important to French interests. The reigning Spanish sovereign, Charles\u00a0IV, was internationally regarded as ineffectual. Even in his own court he was seen as a \"half-wit king who renounces cares of state for the satisfaction of hunting\", and a cuckold unable to control his energetic wife, Maria Luisa of Parma. Napoleon took advantage of the weak king by suggesting the two nations conquer and divide Portugal, with France and Spain each taking a third of the spoils, and the final third going to the Spanish Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy, along with the title Prince of the Algarve. Godoy was seduced, and accepted the French offer. He failed, however, to grasp Napoleon's true intentions, and was unaware that his new ally and co-sovereign, the former king's son Ferdinand\u00a0VII of Spain, was using the invasion merely as a ploy to seize the Spanish parliament and throne. Ferdinand intended not only that Godoy be killed during the impending power struggle, but also that the lives of his own parents be sacrificed.\r Under the guise of reinforcing the Spanish armies, 23,000 French troops entered Spain unopposed in November 1807. Even when Napoleon's intentions became clear the following February, the occupying forces found little resistance apart from isolated actions in disconnected areas, including Saragossa. Napoleon's principal commander, Marshal Joachim Murat, believed that Spain would benefit from rulers more progressive and competent than the Bourbons, and Napoleon's brother Joseph Bonaparte was to be made king. After Napoleon convinced Ferdinand to return Spanish rule to Charles IV, the latter was left with no choice but to abdicate, on March 19, 1808, in favor of Joseph Bonaparte.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: The Burial of the Sardine (Corpus Christi Festival on Ash Wednesday)\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/the-burial-of-the-sardine-corpus-christi-festival-on-ash-wednesday-1814\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Burial of the Sardine (Spanish: El entierro de la sardina) is an oil-on-panel painting by Spanish artist Francisco Goya, usually dated to the 1810s. The title is posthumous, referring to the culminating event of a three-day carnival in Madrid ending on Ash Wednesday. Masked and disguised revellers are seen dancing their way to the banks of the Manzanares, where a ceremonial sardine will be buried. Goya does not illustrate the fish in the painting, nor the large doll made of straw, called a pelele, from which it hung; the centrepiece is the darkly grinning \"King of the Carnival\".\r The painting has been dated between 1793 and 1819, but most accounts place it toward the end of this range on account of the painting's style and its place within the shifting themes of Goya's art as he aged. The Burial appears to fit within a progression beginning with the artist's bright, youthful works\u2014in which he painted commissions of popular entertainments and colourful cartoon tapestries\u2014and his much later, psychologically darker Black Paintings. The painting is certainly a tribute to the common people, depicting an exuberant crowd carousing on the first day of Lent while other Spanish Catholics worship at church. Yet the celebration takes on a sinister aspect due to the many masked and blank faces (see the detail in \"Gallery\") surrounding the gaily dancing women in white; the grey, distorted trees and encroaching dark colours; and the eye-catching black banner that parades an unsettling mascot. Such festivals as the \"Burial of the Sardine\" originated with themes of mortality: masks were worn to ward off the spirits of criminals and those who had died violently. The word \"mortus\" (\"death\") is barely visible on the banner though in a preparatory ink sketch by Goya (in the gallery below) it features prominently over an indistinct shape which may be a representation of the sardine itself. The painting forms a loose thematic set with other paintings of religious ceremony that Goya produced around the same time, among which are A Procession of Flagellants (Procesi\u00f3n de disciplinantes) and Inquisition Scene (Auto de fe de la Inquisici\u00f3n).\r Goya scholar Fred Licht writes:\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: The Duke of Wellington\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/the-duke-of-wellington-1814\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of the Duke of Wellington is a painting by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya of the British general Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington during the latter's service in the Peninsular War.

The Wolfson Foundation offered \u00a3100,000 and the government added a special Treasury grant of \u00a340,000, matching Wrightsman's bid and obtaining the painting for the National Gallery in London, where it was first put on display on 2 August 1961. It was stolen nineteen days later, on 21 August 1961. It was later returned and Kempton Bunton confessed to taking the painting and its frame in July 1965. Following a high-profile trial in which he was defended by Jeremy Hutchinson, QC, Bunton was found not guilty of stealing the painting, but guilty of stealing the frame.\r The theft entered popular culture, as it was referenced in the 1962 James Bond film Dr. No. In the film, the painting was on display in Dr. Julius No's lair, suggesting the first Bond villain had stolen the work.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: The Madhouse\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/the-madhouse-1814\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madhouse (Casa de locos) or Asylum (Manicomio) is an oil-on-panel painting by Francisco de Goya. He produced it between 1812 and 1819. It shows a mental asylum, with its inhabitants in many different poses.\r Marked by Piranesian and claustrophobic architecture, the painting's only light source is a barred window high up on the wall, clearly meant to repress the figures below. These figures are distinct characters, all engaged in grotesque and pitiable behaviour - one wears what seems to be a wild-feathered headdress, another is fighting in a tricorne hat, another makes a gesture of blessing to the viewer, whilst many of the others are naked.\r The subject of psychiatric institutions was a hot topic in the salons of the Spanish Enlightenment and so this painting could be meant as a denunciation of then-current practice in that area. Even if it is not, Goya was always attracted to representing madness, deformity or perversion. Some of the figures can also be interpreted allegorically, as a gallery of parodies of powerful figures in society, such as the clergy or the army (the man in the tricorne). It develops the topic of 'the world of dreams' ('mundo al rev\u00e9s') and is related to Goya's engravings series Los disparates.\r Goya had already touched on the issue in his 1793 painting Yard with Lunatics, but The Madhouse shows greater variety, with less mad, less picturesque, more individualised and more characterised figures, shown more humanity and clearly marked as poor victims of marginalisation and rejection.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: The Junta of the Philippines\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/the-junta-of-the-philippines-1815\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Junta of the Philippines or Sessions of the Junta of the Royal Company of the Philippines (Spanish: Junta de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Filipinas) is an oil-on-canvas painting, c. 1815 by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya. The work is the largest Goya produced. It was commissioned that year to commemorate the March 30th annual meeting of the Royal Company of the Philippines (Real Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Filipinas) attended by 51 shareholders and members, during a period when Goya was disillusioned by the formerly exiled Ferdinand VII's return to the Spanish crown, which moved away from enlightenment and ended the hopes of Spanish liberals for a more progressive Spain.\r The Junta of the Philippines painting captures a moment when, unexpectedly, Ferdinand decided to attend the meeting of Junta, intending his presence to be an affirmation of his commitment to the empire. However it had the opposite effect; the Spanish economy and empire lay in ruins after the Peninsular War, the Royal Company of the Philippines was by that time so unprofitable and ineffective as to be irrelevant, and Ferdinand a king who had learned nothing from the turmoil of the preceding years when he had been over thrown. Ferdinand's return lead to mass emigration and exile amongst the Spanish intellectual class. Although Goya remained until in Spain for a number of years and continued to depict his king, he too fled in exile to France in 1824.\r As with his c. 1800 Charles IV of Spain and His Family, the Spanish king is portrayed in full pomp and finery, albeit through barely concealed gritted teeth. Ferdinand is shown in the center middle-ground, seated at a raised table and flanked by trembling associates. To his left sits Miguel de Lardazibal, minister for the Indies, who was imprisoned the following September and forced into exile by the crown. Before these men, the assembly members are massed in two groups divided left and right by carpet. An expanse of light spills across the floor, spread before the absolute monarch, and lit from a source situated near the viewer of the painting. While the work was painted on commission and intended to hang in the ceremonial hall in which it was set, it highlights in an unflattering manner the centrality and impotent grip of the king. To art historian Albert Boime, the painting shows a monarch who rules not through respect, but through last resort; absolute power and fear.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: The Forge\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/the-forge\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Forge is a c. 1817 painting by Francisco Goya (1746\u20131828), today housed in the Frick Collection in New York City. The large oil on canvas represents three blacksmiths toiling over an anvil, and has been described by the art historian Fred Licht as \"undoubtedly the most complete statement of Goya's late style.\"\r Devoid of narrative, the painting is an almost photographic capture of a single moment. Set in an ambiguous space, it forms a study in grays, blues and black, punctuated by the blazing red of heated metal. The composition is balanced by the complementary gestures of the figures.\r The Forge emphasises the muscularity of the men, who are rendered as classically heroic with thick, strong arms and heavy masculine backs. Yet their faces indicate a coarseness of temperament\u2014a device likely used to make them more identifiable to the common man. The figures are likely intended to represent the working class of the 19th-century Spain\u2014hammering out the future of the country in a literal allegory to the then-popular saying \"on the anvil of history\". In this way, the work evokes the imagery of resistance to the French threat from Napoleon, earlier examined by Goya in his 1808 painting The Knife Grinder, and may refer to the peoples' participation in drafting the Constitution. Though a court painter, Goya was sensitive throughout his life to the plight of common men. He often captured their everyday lives, usually emphasising the dignity of work or the suffering of war.\r Other meanings have been suggested. Art historian Janis Tomlinson notes that the presence of the old man in the painting may be a reference to the Forge of Vulcan, a classical story in which the god was deceived by his young wife; if so, The Forge may also be thematically related to two other paintings by Goya that are the same dimensions: The Young Ones (Les Jeunes) and Time (Les Vielles), each of which illustrate female inconstancy. Though seeing \"no hint of a classical source\", art historian Michael Fried has interpreted sexual implications in \"the strong pelvic thrust of the near worker depicted from behind in combination with the fierce concentration of all the workers on the red hot iron.\"\r The work appears to be related to his drawing Three Men Digging, which may have been made as a preparatory study, and notwithstanding the uncertainty in dating both works, it is supposed that both were done between 1815 and 1820 because of stylistic affinities to the Black Paintings. Despite similarities between the figures' positions in the drawing and the painting, there are several differences. The viewpoint in The Forge is lower, and makes the figures appear more imposing; unlike the drawing, two of the men's faces are visible; and the action in the drawing involves the digging of a hole with farm tools, while that of the painting is focused on an anvil. Both images may be seen as abstracted rather than realistic visions, as they each lack anecdotal context, and place three men in an impractical proximity.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Inquisition Scene\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/inquisition-scene-1819\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Inquisition Tribunal, also known as The Court of the Inquisition or The Inquisition Scene (Spanish: Escena de Inquisici\u00f3n), is an 18x29 inch oil-on-panel painting produced by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya between 1812 and 1819. The painting belongs to a series which also includes The Bullfight, The Madhouse and A Procession of Flagellants, all reflecting customs which liberals (of whom Goya was then one) objected to and wished were abandoned, but their reform was opposed by the absolutist policy of Ferdinand VII of Spain.\r The work was owned by Manuel Garc\u00eda de la Prada and is now in the collection of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid.\r The painting depicts an auto-da-f\u00e9 (Spanish, \"act of faith\") by a tribunal of the Spanish Inquisition, being held inside a church. The four accused people are wearing tall, pointed coroza or Capirote (a three-foot tall pointed dunce cap) on their heads and clad in sanbenitos describing their offences. Ringed around the accused are the clerics and Inquisitors and farther back a sea of invited guests fill the church interior, witnessing the drama. Every figure in the foreground is in the light, individualised and well-characterised, whereas the background is occupied by an anonymous mass of people shut in by darkness and a claustrophobic Gothic architecture.\r Born in 1746, Goya moved from his home town Saragossa to Madrid in 1775. He became a cartoon painter in the royal tapestry factory and his work was brought to the attention of the Spanish royalty. He was appointed court painter in 1789. Long before he painted The Inquisition Tribunal, in 1783, he made a portrait of Don Manuel Osorio Manrique de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga aged six, who later became a cardinal at the age of twenty three and ended the notorious Spanish Inquisition.\r By the time period in which this painting was most likely completed, Goya was long finished with painting sunny pictures in the rococo style. He had suffered a grave illness in 1792 that left him permanently deaf. This crisis marked a turning point in his work; instead of light-hearted decorations he painted strong essays on the turmoil and raw emotion of man\u2019s inhumanity to man. The Inquisition Tribunal is one of a series of paintings marked by an instance of cruelty\u2014here in the Inquisition Tribunal, the threat of being burned at the stake, symbolised by the pointed hats worn by the accused. A Procession of Flagellants, another one of Goya's works in this series, shows the presence of cruelty and the use of symbolism, where blood is seen flowing out onto the white garment of figures. Its size is 46\u00a0cm x 73\u00a0cm (18 inches x 29 inches). It is an oil on panel.\r The Spanish Inquisition was established in 1478 to keep Catholic orthodoxy. The first auto-da-f\u00e9 took place in Seville in 1481, when six conversos (Jews forcibly converted to Christianity) were burnt at the stake. In Goya's lifetime he would have been quite aware of the history and strong influence that the church held on Spanish society. Though the Inquisition was winding down it was not until 1834 that it was officially ended. Goya sketched, painted and printed many scenes showing the barbarity and cruelty of the Spanish Inquisition and of the turbulent, warring times in which he lived.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: The Dog\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil,plaster\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/the-dog\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Dog is the name usually given to a painting by Spanish artist Francisco Goya, now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid. It shows the head of a small dog gazing upwards. The dog itself is almost lost in the vastness of the rest of the image, which is empty except for a dark sloping area near the bottom of the picture: an unidentifiable mass which conceals the animal's body.\r The Dog is one of Goya's Black Paintings, which he painted directly onto the walls of his house sometime between 1819 and 1823 when he was in his mid 70s, living alone and suffering from acute mental and physical distress. He did not intend the paintings for public exhibition (they were not removed from the house until 50 years after Goya had left), so it is unlikely that he gave them titles.\r In 1819, Goya purchased a house named \"Quinta del Sordo\" (\"Villa of the Deaf Man\") on the banks of the Manzanares near Madrid. It was a small two-story house which was named after a previous occupant who had been deaf, though Goya also happened to be functionally deaf, as a result of an illness he had contracted (probably lead poisoning) in 1792. Between 1819 and 1823, when he moved to Bordeaux, Goya produced a series of 14 works, which he painted with oils directly onto the walls of the house.\r At the age of 73, and having survived two life-threatening illnesses, Goya was likely to have been concerned with his own mortality, and was increasingly embittered by the conflicts that had engulfed Spain in the decade preceding his move to the Quinta del Sordo, and the developing civil strife\u2013indeed, Goya was completing the plates that formed his series The Disasters of War during this period. Although he initially decorated the rooms of the house with more inspiring images, in time he overpainted all of them with the intense haunting pictures known today as the Black Paintings. Uncommissioned and never meant for public display, these pictures reflect his darkening mood, with their depictions of intense scenes of malevolence, conflict and despair.\r If Goya gave titles to the works he produced at the Quinta del Sordo he never revealed what they were; the names by which they are now known were assigned by others after his death, and this painting is often identified by variations on the common title: A Dog, Head of a Dog, The Buried Dog, The Half-Drowned Dog, The Half-Submerged Dog; more colloquially as \"Goya's Dog\"; or by the Spanish names El Perro or Perro Semihundido.\r The painting is divided into two unequal sections: an upper, dirty ochre \"sky\" and a smaller sloping curved dark brown section which fades to black as it slopes up to the right. Over the top of this lower section the dog's head can be seen, its snout lifted, its ears pulled back and its eyes looking up and towards the right. A faint dark shape looms over the dog; this is sometimes considered to be damage or an intentional inclusion, but is generally seen as an artifact from the earlier painting that decorated the wall before Goya overpainted it with The Dog.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Goya Attended by Doctor Arrieta\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/goya-attended-by-doctor-arrieta-1820\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSelf-portrait with Dr Arrieta is the name given to a painting by Spanish artist Francisco Goya. The work is an oil painting on canvas which was created in 1820. It is held in Minneapolis Institute of Art, Minnesota.\r In 1792, Goya developed a sudden serious illness which included dizziness, weakness, delirium, sickness, abdominal pain, deafness, and partial blindness. By the time he returned to Madrid, in 1793, Goya was completely deaf. Various diagnoses of this serious illness have been offered: syphilis, lead poisoning, cerebrovascular disease, acute infection of the central nervous system, and the rare condition of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome\u2014temporary inflammation of the uveal tract associated with permanent deafness. In 1819 Goya had a second serious illness. Little information is available either on the nature of the illness or on Dr Arrieta's treatment. The painting is the main source, and an inscription below the figures explains why Goya made the picture: \u201cGoya, in gratitude to his friend Arrieta: for the compassion and care with which he saved his life during the acute and dangerous illness he suffered towards the end of the year 1819 in his seventy-third year. He painted it in 1820\u201c.\r Goya is seated on his bed obviously weak from his illness. He grasps his bed-sheet as if clinging on to life and is supported from falling backwards by the arm of Arrieta. The doctor gently encourages his patient to take the medicine. Shadowy figures\u2014perhaps his servants and a priest\u2014in the background seem to be portents of doom. Goya may have expected to die, but under Arrieta's care, he was nursed back to health and lived another eight years. Self Portrait with Dr Arrieta is an image of hope amidst despair and the colours are correspondingly more delicate and lighter than in other works of this period.\r The work was a present for Arrieta. It was painted in gratitude for the gift of life, not as a memento mori. It is uncertain how long the painting remained in Arrieta's possession. In 1820 he travelled to Africa to research bubonic plague, and it is probable that the painting remained in Spain. By 1860, when exhibited in Madrid, it was in the collection of Mr Martinez of Madrid. Later the painting was recorded in various private collections in Paris before being acquired by the Minneapolis Institute of Art.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Asmodea / Fantastic Vision\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/asmodea-1823\n\nWikipedia Article:\nAsmodea or Fantastic Vision (Spanish: Visi\u00f3n fant\u00e1stica) are names given to a fresco painting likely completed between 1820\u20131823 by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya. It shows two flying figures hovering over a landscape dominated by a large tabled mountain. Asmodea is one of Goya's 14 Black Paintings\u2014his last major series\u2014which, in mental and physical despair, he painted at the end of his life directly onto the walls of his house, the Quinta del Sordo, outside Madrid.\r No written or oral record survives as to the series' intended meaning, and it is probable that they were never intended to be seen by those outside his then small immediate circle. Goya did not name any of the works in the series; the title of Asmodea was later given by his friend, the Spanish painter Antonio Brugada. The title is likely a feminine naming of the demon king Asmodeus from the Book of Tobias. Asmodeus also appears in the myth of the Greek Titan Prometheus, in which the goddess Minerva carries him to the Caucasus mountains.\r Two figures, one male and one female, are shown airborne, hovering above a broad landscape. The woman wears a white dress covered by a red-rose coloured robe. Both seem fearful, she covers the lower half of her face with her robe, his face is deeply disturbed. They are each looking in opposite directions, while he points to a town on top of a mountain on the right of the canvas. Critic Evan Connell notes that the mountain's shape resembles Gibraltar, a refuge for Spanish liberals during the aftermath of the Peninsular War. In the foreground, a row of French soldiers, resembling those from Goya's 1814 The Third of May 1808, take aim at a group of people passing in the lower distance. This group is traveling with horses and wagons, and are perhaps refugees fleeing from the earlier war with France, the victims of whom Goya had detailed so closely in his The Disasters of War.\r Writer Richard Cottrell has noted the similarity in the colouring of the 'livid' sky with another work from the Black Painting series, The Dog. The work bears similarity to Atropos and A Pilgrimage to San Isidro, in that it utilises an elliptical visual device to distort the viewer's perspective. In this case the robe of the male flyer brings him almost out of the canvas and much closer to the viewer than the female flyer. Like Atropos, this work is one of the only from the series in which its intended meaning can be deduced from its classical sources.\r This work was originally created on cloth hung on a wall, and like most of the others in the series, painted over an earlier version of the scene. Goya placed the work on the side walls of the upper floor of the Quinta. It was later transferred to canvas, and today is on permanent display with the other works from the series at the Museo del Prado, Madrid. According to writer Rolfh Kentish, it is an example of Goya's,\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Atropos (The Fates)\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil,plaster\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/atropos-the-fates-1823\n\nWikipedia Article:\nAtropos, or The Fates (Spanish: \u00c1tropos or Las Parcas) is one of the 14 Black Paintings painted by Francisco de Goya between 1819\u201323. Goya, then 75 and in mental and physical despair, created the series directly onto the interior walls of the house known as the Quinta del Sordo (\"House of the Deaf Man\"), purchased in 1819.  It probably occupied a position on the second floor of the house beside the Fight with Cudgels and across from the Fantastic Vision. Like the rest of the black paintings, it was transferred to canvas in 1873\u201374 under the supervision of Salvador Mart\u00ednez Cubells, a curator at the Museo del Prado. The owner, Baron Emile d'Erlanger, donated the canvases to the Spanish state in 1881, and they are now on display at the  Prado.  The painting is a reinterpretation of the mythological subject of the goddesses of destiny\u2014the Moirai or fates as recounted in Homer, Hesiod, Virgil and other classical writers. These \"Daughters of Night\" were headed by Atropos, the inexorable goddess of death, who carries a few scissors to cut the thread of life; Clotho, with her distaff (which Goya replaces with a doll or newborn child, possibly an allegory of life), and Lachesis, the spinning one, which in this representation looks across a lens or in a mirror and symbolizes time, since she was the one who measured the length of the fiber. To the three female figures suspended in the air a fourth figure is added in the foreground. Possibly male, this figure's hands are bound behind him as if is captive. If this interpretation is true, the fates would be deciding the destiny of the man whose bound hands cannot be opposed to his fate. It has been speculated that he may represent Prometheus, who was bound on a mountain and left to be savaged by an eagle as punishment for stealing fire from Mount Olympus. All four are hideously ugly.  The painting's range of color is diminished, as much or even more so than the other black paintings, to ochres and blacks. This reinforces a nocturnal and unreal atmosphere, appropriate to the mythical subject of this work. The arbitrary, irrational aspects of Goyas black paintings have given them a place as precursors to Modern art.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Don Ramon Satue\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/don-ramon-satue-1823\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Don Ram\u00f3n Satu\u00e9 is an 1823 oil on panel painting by the Spanish artist Francisco de Goya in the collection of the Rijksmuseum.

He wears a black suit with a red vest and white shirt open casually at the neck. He is disheveled and his hands rest in his trouser pockets.\r This painting was purchased in 1922 by the Vereniging Rembrandt and gifted to the Rijksmuseum, where it has been included in all Highlights of the Rijksmuseum catalogs since. It originally belonged to the collection of the Marquis de Heredia of Madrid who sold it through Benito Garriga of the same city by auction in 1890 at the H\u00f4tel Drouot in Paris. It sold for 1,500 francs (lot no. 3). The same auction house sold it again in 1902 (lot no. 21) for 9,510 francs by Dr. Joachim Carvalho for his property Ch\u00e2teau de Villandry, France.\r While experts had already suspected that there was a different composition under this portrait of Judge Satu\u00e9, the researchers Joris Dik and Koen Janssens used X-ray technology they developed to examine this painting and discovered it does indeed show another portrait in the dress of a senior French official with medals on his chest: a general or possibly even the king of Spain, Joseph Bonaparte. That underpainting would have been painted around 1810 during the Peninsular War. According to Joris Dik, \"Goya, we know, managed to survive both political situations \u2013 the transfer of Spain to the French and back to Spain \u2026 After 1820, [such a portrait] could have been dangerous. That's when we believe the portrait was overpainted with the figure we can see now, as that painting dates from 1823.\"\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Fight With Cudgels\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/fight-with-cudgels-1823\n\nWikipedia Article:\nFight with Cudgels (Spanish: Ri\u00f1a a garrotazos or Duelo a garrotazos), called The Strangers or Cowherds in the inventories, is the name given to a painting by Spanish artist Francisco Goya, now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid. One of the series of Black Paintings Goya painted directly onto the walls of his house sometime between 1820 and 1823, it depicts two men fighting one another with cudgels, as they seem to be trapped knee-deep in a quagmire of mud or sand.\r According to Francisco-Xavier de Salas Bosch, Goya may have been referencing an allegory (number 75) that appears in the work by Diego de Saavedra Fajardo, the emblem book Empresas Pol\u00edticos [Political Maxims], Idea de un pr\u00edncipe pol\u00edtico cristiano, which contained a hundred short essays on the education of a prince. The allegory referred to the Greek myth of Cadmus and the dragon's teeth. By the instructions of Athena, Cadmus sowed the dragon's teeth in the ground, from which there sprang a race of fierce armed men, called Spartoi (\"sown\"). By throwing a stone among them, Cadmus caused them to fall upon one another until only five survived, who assisted him to build the Cadmea or citadel of Thebes.\r Saavedra used this imagery to discuss how some rulers stir up discord in order to ultimately establish peace in their kingdoms. Goya's use of this allegory may have referred to the policies and politics of Ferdinand VII.\r In 1819, Goya purchased a house on the banks of the Manzanares near Madrid named Quinta del Sordo (\"Villa of the Deaf Man\"). It was a small two-story house which was named after a previous occupant who had been deaf, although Goya had also been left deaf after contracting a fever in 1792. Between 1819 and 1823, when he moved to Bordeaux, Goya produced a series of 14 works, which he painted with oils directly onto the walls of the house. Fight with Cudgels had been situated in the upper room of Quinta del Sordo.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Judith and Holofernes\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/judith-and-holovernes-1823\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJudith and Holofernes is the name given to one of the 14 Black Paintings painted by Francisco de Goya between 1819 and 1823. By this time, Goya was in his mid 70s and deeply disillusioned. In mental and physical despair, he painted the private works on the interior walls of his home\u2014applying oils directly on plaster\u2014known as the Quinta del Sordo (The House of the Deaf Man), which he had purchased in 1819. Judith and Holofernes was likely painted on the first floor, beside Saturn Devouring His Son. The picture is a personal reinterpretation of the narrative of the Book of Judith, in which the protagonist saves Israel from the assault of the general Holofernes by seducing and beheading him. Judith is the only historical figure who can be identified with certainty among the Black Paintings.\r Judith and Holofernes' palette consists of blacks, ochres and red applied with very free, broad and energetic brushstrokes. The lighting is both focused and highly theatrical, and seems to imply a night scene lit by a torch, which illuminates Judith's face and outstretched arm and leaves in semidarkness the face of the old serving woman whose darkened outline is shown in prayer. Significantly, neither Holofernes nor the blood streaming from his neck is shown, as is typical of most artistic renderings.\r Given Goya's bitter disillusionment over the second restoration of Fernando VII, it is possible that Holofernes represents the Spanish King, whom Goya privately despised. Holofernes' death was often depicted in art as a symbol of the defeat of tyranny. This would have been a brave and daring allusion for an artist with such ties to the crown as Goya had. Goya did not believe, however, that the series would ever be viewed by anyone but himself, which allowed him greater freedom of expression. He had been secretive before when delivering unpalatable political views through his work; his The Disasters of War series of etchings harshly comments on both the Peninsular War and the later Bourbon Restoration, but was only published 35 years after his death.\r A number of other interpretations are possible. The work may allude to Leocadia, his young maid and companion in his final years. More probably, the picture deals generally with the power of women over men. From a psychoanalytic standpoint the painting can be seen as dealing with the topic of castration\u2014a view which should be placed in the context of Goya's personal situation: he was an old man of more than 70 years living with his much younger lover. Perhaps significantly, the painting was originally situated across from one believed to depict Leocadia beside Goya's tomb.\r Along with the other works in the series, the painting was transferred to canvas in 1873\u201374 for Baron Emile d'Erlanger under the supervision of Salvador Mart\u00ednez Cubells, a curator at the Museo del Prado. D'Erlanger donated all 14 canvases to the Prado in 1881.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Leocadia\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/leocadia-1823\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLa Leocadia (Spanish: Do\u00f1a Leocadia) or The Seductress (Spanish: Una Manola) are names given to a mural by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya (1746\u20131828), completed sometime between 1819\u201323, as one of his series of 14 Black Paintings. It shows a woman commonly identified as Goya's maid, companion and, most likely lover, Leocadia Weiss. She is dressed in a dark, almost funeral maja dress, and leans against what is either a mantelpiece or burial mound, as she looks outward at the viewer with a sorrowful expression. Leocadia is one of the final of the \"Black Paintings\", which he painted in his seventies at a time when he was consumed by political, physical and psychological turmoil, after he fled to the country from his position as court painter in Madrid.\r According to the c. 1828\u201330 inventory of his friend Antonio Brugada, Leocadia was situated in the ground floor of his villa which Lawrence Gowing observes was thematically divided: a male side of Saturn Devouring His Son, A Pilgrimage to San Isidro; and a female side compromising Judith and Holofernes, Aquelarre and Leocadia. All the works in the series were transferred to canvas after Goya's death and are now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.\r In 1819, Goya purchased the Quinta del Sordo (\"Villa of the Deaf Man\") situated on the banks of the Manzanares near Madrid. This small two-story house was named after a previous occupant who had been deaf, though Goya himself, by coincidence, had been functionally deaf for more than two decades, the result of an illness contracted in 1792. At the age of 73, and having survived two life-threatening illnesses, Goya was likely to have been concerned with his own mortality, and was increasingly embittered by the conflicts that engulfed Spain in the decade preceding his move to the Quinta del Sordo, and the developing Spanish Civil War of 1820\u20131823 and the civil strife \u2014 indeed, Goya was completing the plates that formed his series The Disasters of War during this period.\r Between 1819 and 1823, before he moved to Bordeaux in 1824, he produced a series of 14 works, which he painted with oils directly onto the walls of his Spanish house. Although he first decorated the rooms of the house with more inspiring images, in time he painted over them with the intense and haunted pictures known today as the Black Paintings \u2014 one of which was the portrait of Leocadia. Uncommissioned and never meant for public display, these pictures reflect his darkening mood, with their depictions of intense scenes of malevolence, conflict and despair. If Goya gave titles to the works he produced at the Quinta del Sordo, he never revealed what they were; the names by which they are now known were assigned by others after his death, and the paintings are often identified by variations on the common title. Goya left Spain and Quinta del Sordo in 1824 for exile in France, where he was joined by his housekeeper Leocadia Weiss and her ten-year-old daughter, Rosario, possibly Goya's child.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Men reading\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,gesso,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/men-reading-1823\n\nWikipedia Article:\nMen Reading or The Reading (Spanish: La Lectura) or Politicians are names given to a fresco painting likely completed between 1820\u20131823 by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya.

The owner, Baron Emile d'Erlanger, donated the work to the Spanish state in 1881, and they are now on display at the Prado.\r Men Reading shows a group of six men huddled together reading a printed page held in the lap of a seated central figure. Although it is not known for certain, they are often thought to be politicians reading, and passing comments on, a newspaper article about themselves. Goya most likely placed the work on a smaller wall of the first floor of the Quinto, next to its companion piece Women Laughing and opposite The Dog and Two Old Men Eating Soup.\r X-ray reveals that the image was dramatically altered before Goya settled on what is now on the canvas. At some stage a landscape in the background showed a mounted rider. The central figure in white at one point had large horns, or possibly bird wings, seemingly growing out of his head. From studying the x-rays art historian Carmen Garrido discovered that the center of the image contained a large white lead impasto beginning at the head of the man looking upwards, and that \"both the part on top of the impasto and that which is level with the rest of the painting are identical, and have neither the texture nor the normal structure of the authentic brushstrokes of the painter.\"\r Thematically and stylistically it shares characteristics with another work from the Black Paintings series, Women Laughing. Both are vertical rather than horizontal and smaller in scale than the other works. Both are thematically less dark than the other works in the series, although they are chromatically darker. Both are lit by identical light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space. Women Laughing shows two hags mocking a man in the act of masturbating, while in Men reading, according to writer Francisco-Xavier de Salas Bosch, \"the incessant talk of the politicians...was perhaps, in Goya\u2019s eyes, as sterile as the solitary pleasure which the women are making fun of.\"\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Two Old Ones Eating Soup / The Witchy Brew\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/old-eating-soup-1823\n\nWikipedia Article:\nTwo Old Ones Eating Soup (Spanish: Dos viejos comiendo sopa) or The Witchy Brew (Spanish: Dos Brujas) is one of the fourteen Black Paintings created by Francisco Goya between 1819\u201323.

The left half of the painting with its bright sky is among the lighter passages of the Black Paintings, which are dominated by browns, greys, and blacks. Another Black Painting, A Pilgrimage to San Isidro, seems of a piece with Pilgrimage except for its darker tone. Both may depict processions to the shrine of San Isidro\u2014a thought reflected in their titles (none given by Goya)\u2014which was close to his home, Quinta del Sordo.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Saturn Devouring One of His Sons\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/saturn-devouring-his-son-1823-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaturn Devouring His Son is the name given to a painting by Spanish artist Francisco Goya. According to the traditional interpretation, it depicts the Greek myth of the Titan Cronus (in the title Romanized to Saturn), who, fearing that he would be overthrown by one of his children, ate each one upon their birth. The work is one of the 14 Black Paintings that Goya painted directly onto the walls of his house sometime between 1819 and 1823. It was transferred to canvas after Goya's death and has since been held in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.\r In 1819, Goya purchased a house on the banks of Manzanares near Madrid called Quinta del Sordo (Villa of the Deaf Man). It was a two-story house which was named after a previous occupant who had been deaf, although the name was fitting for Goya too, who had been left deaf after contracting a fever in 1792. Between 1819 and 1823, when he left the house to move to Bordeaux, Goya produced a series of 14 works, which he painted with oils directly onto the walls of the house. At the age of 73, and having survived two life-threatening illnesses, Goya was likely to have been concerned with his own mortality, and was increasingly embittered by the civil strife occurring in Spain. Although he initially decorated the rooms of the house with more inspiring images, in time he overpainted them all with the intensely haunting pictures known today as the Black Paintings. Uncommissioned and never meant for public display, these pictures reflect his darkening mood with some tense scenes of malevolence and conflict.\r Saturn Devouring His Son, a disturbing portrait of the titan Saturn consuming one of his children, was one of six works with which Goya decorated the dining room. According to Roman myth (inspired by the original Greek myth), it had been foretold that one of the sons of Saturn would overthrow him, just as he had overthrown his father, Caelus. To prevent this, Saturn ate his children moments after each was born. His wife Ops eventually hid his third son, Jupiter, on the island of Crete, deceiving Saturn by offering a stone wrapped in swaddling in his place. Jupiter eventually supplanted his father just as the prophecy had predicted.\r Goya never named the works he produced at Quinta del Sordo; the names were assigned by others after his death, and this painting is also known as just Saturn, Saturn Devouring One of His Sons, Saturn Devouring his Children or by the Spanish names Saturno devorando a su hijo or Saturno devorando a un hijo.\r Goya depicts Saturn feasting upon one of his sons. His child's head and part of the left arm have already been consumed. The right arm has probably been eaten too, though it could be folded in front of the body and held in place by Saturn's thumbs. The titan is on the point of taking another bite from the left arm; as he looms from the darkness, his mouth gapes and his eyes bulge widely. The only other brightness in the picture comes from the white flesh, the red blood of the corpse, the white knuckles of Saturn as he digs his fingers into the back of the body. There is evidence that the picture may have originally portrayed the titan with a partially erect penis, but, if ever present, this addition was lost due to the deterioration of the mural over time or during the transfer to canvas; in the picture today the area around his groin is indistinct. It may even have been overpainted deliberately before the picture was put on public display.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: The Pilgrimage of San Isidro\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/the-pilgrimage-of-san-isidro-1823\n\nWikipedia Article:\nA Pilgrimage to San Isidro (Spanish: La romer\u00eda de San Isidro) is one of the Black Paintings painted by Francisco de Goya between 1819\u201323 on the interior walls of the house known as \"The House of the Deaf Man\" (Quinta del Sordo) that he purchased in 1819. It probably occupied a wall on the first floor of the house, opposite The Great He-Goat.\r Like the other Black Paintings, it was transferred to canvas in 1873\u201374 under the supervision of Salvador Mart\u00ednez Cubells, a curator at the Museo del Prado. The owner, Baron Emile d'Erlanger, donated the canvases to the Spanish state in 1881, and they are now on display at the Museo del Prado.\r A Pilgrimage to San Isidro shows a view of the pilgrimage towards San Isidro's Hermitage of Madrid that is totally opposite to Goya's treatment of the same subject thirty years earlier in The Meadow of San Isidro. If the earlier work was a question of depicting the customs of a traditional holiday in Madrid and providing a reasonably accurate view of the city, the present painting depicts a group of prominent figures in the night, apparently intoxicated and singing with distorted faces. Figures from diverse social strata also figure in the painting. In the foreground a group of humble extraction appears, while farther into the background top hats and nuns' habits can be seen.\r The topic of the procession was used to emphasize theatrical or satirical aspects; in this respect the picture has parallels to The Burial of the Sardine, painted between 1812 and 1819.\r It is a recurring theme in Goya's paintings to present a crowd that fades little by little into the distance. Already it was present in San Isidro's Meadow and it was later used frequently in The Disasters of War. At the very edge of this painting the silhouette of the rocky outcroppings and that of the parading multitude coincides; this way, the opened space emphasizes the whole rest of the solid and compact mass, dehumanizing the individuals into a formless group. The exception is a figure to the right whose face can be seen in profile and seems to moan or sing.\r Like the other works in this series, the painting's palette is very diminished. In this case, blacks, ochres, grays and earth tones are applied with very free, energetic brushstrokes. The theme of the loss of identity in crowds in this painting can be seen as a precursor to expressionist painting, particularly the work of James Ensor.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: Two Old Men / Two Monks / An Old Man and a Monk\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil,plaster\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/two-monks-1823\n\nWikipedia Article:\nTwo Old Men, also known as Two Monks or An Old Man and a Monk (Spanish: Dos viejos, Dos frailes, or Un viejo y un fraile) are names given to one of the 14 Black Paintings painted by Francisco Goya between 1819-23. Goya was then in his mid-70s and in mental and physical distress. He painted the works on the interior walls of the house known as \"The House of the Deaf Man\" (Quinta del Sordo) that he purchased in 1819.\r In the picture, two elderly figures dressed in friar's habits stand before a black background. The man in front has a long grey beard, is tall and rests on a cane. He may represent Chronos, the god of time. Beside him is a highly-caricatured figure whose face is animal-like. This figure seems to be shouting into the ear of his companion, which might be an allusion to Goya's deafness.\r There is a noticeable difference between the treatment of the two figures. Calmly resting on his walking stick with a sad but serene expression, the bearded man recalls the philosophers depicted by Vel\u00e1zquez, which had been copied by Goya. In vivid contrast, the features of his monstrous companion recall the friars depicted by Goya in his Caprichos and Disparates.\r The Black Paintings were not intended to be seen by anyone but the artist. Two Old Men likely occupied a position on the first floor, opposite Judith and Holofernes. Like other paintings in the series, it was transferred to canvas between 1873-74 under the supervision of Salvador Mart\u00ednez Cubells, a curator at the Museo del Prado.

It explores themes of violence, intimidation, aging and death. Satan hulks, in the form of a goat, in moonlit silhouette over a coven of ugly and terrified witches. Goya was then around 75 years old, living alone and suffering from acute mental and physical distress.  It is one of the fourteen Black Paintings that Goya applied in oil on the plaster walls of his house, the Quinta del Sordo. The paintings were completed in secret: he did not title any of the works or leave record of his intentions in creating them. Absent of fact, Witches' Sabbath is generally seen by art historians as a satire on the credulity of the age, a condemnation of superstition and the witch trials of the Spanish Inquisition. As with the other works in the group, Witches' Sabbath reflects its painter's disillusionment and can be linked thematically to his earlier etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters as well as the Disasters of War print series, another bold political statement published only posthumously.  Around 1874, some fifty years after his death, the plaster murals were taken down and transferred to canvas supports. Witches' Sabbath was much wider before transfer\u00a0\u2013 it was the broadest of the Black Paintings. During the transfer about 140\u00a0cm (55\u00a0in) of the painting was cut from the right-hand side.  At its reduced dimensions of 141\u00a0\u00d7 436\u00a0cm (56\u00a0\u00d7 172 in), its framing is unusually tightly cropped, which some critics find adds to its haunted, spectral aura, although others believe it distorts Goya's intentions by moving the centre of balance and reducing the painting's impact.  Goya did not title any of the fourteen Black Paintings; their modern names came about after his death. They are not inscribed, mentioned in his letters, and there are no records of him speaking of them. The works today are known by a variety of titles, most of which date to around the 1860s: his children were largely responsible for the names, with close friend Bernardo de Iriarte\u00a0[es] contributing the rest. The title El Gran Cabron (The Great He-Goat) was given by painter Antonio Brugada (1804\u201363). The Basque term for a Witches' Sabbath, akelarre, is the source of the Spanish title Aquelarre and a derivation of akerra, the Basque word for a male goat, which may have been combined with the word larre (\"field\") to arrive at akelarre.  The historical record of Goya's later life is relatively scant; no accounts of his thoughts from this time survive. He deliberately suppressed a number of his works from this period \u00a0\u2013 most notably the Disasters of War series\u00a0\u2013 which are today considered amongst his finest. He was tormented by a dread of old age and fear of madness, the latter possibly from anxiety caused by an undiagnosed illness that left him deaf from the early 1790s. Goya had been a successful and royally placed artist, but withdrew from public life during his final years. From the late 1810s he lived in near-solitude outside Madrid in a farmhouse converted into a studio. The house had become known as \"La Quinta del Sordo\" (The House of the Deaf Man), after the nearest farmhouse had coincidentally also belonged to a deaf man. Art historians assume Goya felt alienated from the social and political trends that followed the 1814 restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, and that he viewed these developments as reactionary means of social control. In his unpublished art he seems to have railed against what he saw as a tactical retreat into Medievalism. It is thought that he had hoped for political and religious reform, but like many liberals became disillusioned when the restored Bourbon monarchy and Catholic hierarchy rejected the Spanish Constitution of 1812.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco Goya\nArtwork Name: The Milkmaid of Bordeaux\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/the-milkmaid-of-bordeaux-1827\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Milkmaid of Bordeaux (Spanish: La lechera de Burdeos) is an oil-on-canvas painting completed between 1825 and 1827, generally attributed to the Spanish artist Francisco Goya (1746\u20131828).\r Although the picture is held in great esteem and widely admired by critics and the public, doubt has been cast by art historians as to whether it is an actual Goya. If authentic then it is likely a portrait of either Rosario Weiss, or more likely, her mother Leocadia Weiss\u2014the artist's nurse during the last years of his life. Leocadia cared for Goya in exile in Bordeaux, where he settled to live among politically liberal friends.\r Following his death, the painting was willed to his last child, Javier (b. 1784). Financial difficulties a year later forced him to sell it to Juan Bautista de Muguiro, a distant relative. Muguiro's descendants donated the work to the Museo del Prado in 1946, where it remains a popular exhibit at the gallery, despite doubts as to its origin.\r Rosario was later a painter, and it is sometimes claimed that she may have been the creator of this work. However, when compared to the relatively amateur works of hers held in the Academia de San Fernando, it is generally considered highly unlikely.\n", "\nArtist: Pablo Picasso\nArtwork Name: The old blind guitarist\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/the-old-blind-guitarist-1903\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Old Guitarist is an oil painting by Pablo Picasso created late 1903\u00a0\u2013\u00a0early 1904. It depicts an old, blind, haggard man with threadbare clothing weakly hunched over his guitar, playing in the streets of Barcelona, Spain. It is currently on display in the Art Institute of Chicago as part of the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection.  At the time of The Old Guitarist\u2019s creation, Modernism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, and Symbolism had merged and created an overall movement called Expressionism which greatly influenced Picasso\u2019s style. Furthermore, El Greco, Picasso\u2019s poor standard of living, and the suicide of a dear friend influenced Picasso\u2019s style at the time which came to be known as his Blue Period. Several x-rays, infrared images and examinations by curators revealed three different figures hidden behind the old guitarist.  At the time, having renounced his classical and traditional education and searching for fame, Picasso and his friend Carlos Casagemas moved to Paris. A year later, Casagemas became hopelessly miserable from a failed love affair and committed suicide. Picasso was greatly afflicted by this  event and was soon depressed and desolate. In addition, Picasso was very poor. His poverty made him identify and relate to beggars, prostitutes and other downtrodden outcasts in society.  These events and circumstances were the impetus for the beginning of Picasso\u2019s Blue Period which lasted from 1901 to 1904. The Blue Period is identified by the flat expanses of blues, greys and blacks, melancholy figures lost in contemplation, and a deep and significant tragedy. After the Blue Period came Picasso's Rose Period, and eventually the Cubism movement which Picasso co-founded.  Elements in The Old Guitarist were carefully chosen to generate a reaction from the spectator. For example, the monochromatic color scheme creates flat, two-dimensional forms that dissociate the guitarist from time and place. In addition, the overall muted blue palette creates a general tone of melancholy and accentuates the tragic and sorrowful theme. The sole use of oil on panel causes a darker and more theatrical mood. Oil tends to blend the colors together without diminishing brightness, creating an even more cohesive dramatic composition.  Furthermore, the guitarist, although muscular, shows little sign of life and appears to be close to death, implying little comfort in the world and accentuating the misery of his situation. Details are eliminated and scale is manipulated to create elongated and elegant proportions while intensifying the silent contemplation of the guitarist and a sense of spirituality. The large, brown guitar is the only significant shift in color found in the painting; its dull brown, prominent against the blue background, becomes the center and focus. The guitar comes to represent the guitarist\u2019s world and only hope for survival. This blind and poor subject depends on his guitar and the small income he can earn from his music for survival. Some art historians believe this painting expresses the solitary life of an artist and the natural struggles that come with the career. Therefore, music, or art, becomes a burden and an alienating force that isolates artists from the world. And yet, despite the isolation, the guitarist (artist) depends on the rest of society for survival. All of these emotions reflect Picasso\u2019s predicament at the time and his criticism of the state of society. The Old Guitarist becomes an allegory of human existence.\n", "\nArtist: Pablo Picasso\nArtwork Name: The girls of Avignon\nArtwork Genre: nude painting (nu)\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/the-girls-of-avignon-1907\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon, originally titled The Brothel of Avignon) is a large oil painting created in 1907 by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. The work, part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, portrays five nude female prostitutes in a brothel on Calle de Aviny\u00f3\u00a0[es], a street in Barcelona. Each figure is depicted in a disconcerting confrontational manner and none is conventionally feminine. The women appear slightly menacing and are rendered with angular and disjointed body shapes. The three figures on the left exhibit facial features in the Iberian style of Picasso's native Spain, while the two on the right are shown with African mask-like features. The racial primitivism evoked in these masks, according to Picasso, moved him to \"liberate an utterly original artistic style of compelling, even savage force.\"  In this adaptation of primitivism and abandonment of perspective in favor of a flat, two-dimensional picture plane, Picasso makes a radical departure from traditional European painting. This proto-cubist work is widely considered to be seminal in the early development of both cubism and modern art.  Les Demoiselles was revolutionary and controversial and led to widespread anger and disagreement, even amongst the painter's closest associates and friends. Matisse considered the work something of a bad joke yet indirectly reacted to it in his 1908 Bathers with a Turtle. Braque too initially disliked the painting yet perhaps more than anyone else, studied the work in great detail. And in fact, his subsequent friendship and collaboration with Picasso led to the cubist revolution. Its resemblance to C\u00e9zanne's The Bathers, Paul Gauguin's statue Oviri and El Greco's Opening of the Fifth Seal has been widely discussed by later critics.  At the time of its first exhibition in 1916, the painting was deemed immoral. The work, painted in Picasso's studio in the Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre, Paris, was seen publicly for the first time at the Salon d'Antin in July 1916, at an exhibition organized by the poet Andr\u00e9 Salmon. It was at this exhibition that Salmon (who had already mentioned the painting in 1912 under the title Le Bordel philosophique) gave the work its current, less scandalous title, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, instead of the title originally chosen by Picasso, Le Bordel d'Avignon. Picasso, who always referred to it as mon bordel (\"my brothel\"), or Le Bordel d'Avignon, never liked Salmon's title and would have instead preferred the  bowdlerization Las chicas de Avignon (\"The Girls of Avignon\").  Picasso came into his own as an important artist during the first decade of the 20th century. He arrived in Paris from Spain around the turn of the century as a young, ambitious painter out to make a name for himself. Although he eventually left most of his friends, relatives and contacts in Spain, he continued to live and paint in Spain while making regular trips back to France. For several years he alternated between living and working in Barcelona, Madrid and the Spanish countryside, and made frequent trips to Paris.\n", "\nArtist: Pablo Picasso\nArtwork Name: Minotaur is wounded\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: etching,paper\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/minotaur-is-wounded-1933\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Vollard Suite is a set of 100 etchings in the neoclassical style by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso, produced from 1930-37. Named for the art dealer who commissioned them, Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939), the suite is in a number of museums, and individual etchings from the suite are collectible. More than 300 sets were created, but many were broken up and the prints sold separately.\r In 1930 Picasso was commissioned to produce the etchings by the art dealer and publisher Ambroise Vollard in exchange for paintings by Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul C\u00e9zanne.\r Picasso worked extensively on the set in the spring of 1933 and completed the suite in 1937. It took a further two years for the printmaker Roger Lacouri\u00e8re to finish printing the 230 full sets, but the death of Vollard in 1939 and the Second World War meant that the sets only started coming onto the art market in the 1950s.\r A 1971 exhibition of the suite in Madrid was attacked by a paramilitary group, the Guerrilleros del Christo Rey (Warriors of Christ the King) who tore the pictures, and poured acid over the prints. The group attacked things associated with Spanish exiles like Picasso who aligned themselves with the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War. A spinning residential building in Brazil was named Suite Vollard after the suite.\r A complete set is owned by the National Gallery of Australia, and a complete set was acquired by the British Museum in 2011 after a donation of \u00a31 million from financier Hamish Parker, a director of Mondrian Investment Partners. The donation was in memory of Parker's father, Major Horace Parker. It had been the British Museum's ambition to own the set, and the acquisistion was described by the museum's director, Neil MacGregor, as \"one of the institution's most important acquisitions of the past 50 years\".\r The works are not based on a literary source, and are not titled, although according to the Fundaci\u00f3n Juan March, \"Some of the themes have a remote origin in Honor\u00e9 de Balzac\u2019s short story Le Chef-d\u2019oeuvre inconnu (The Unknown Masterpiece, 1831), which greatly impressed Picasso. It tells the story of a painter\u2019s efforts to capture life itself on canvas through the means of feminine beauty\". The works are inscribed by Picasso with the year month and day that he drew the image. Writing in the Daily Telegraph Richard Dorment claims that as Picasso took such a long time to create the suite, \"the imagery and the emotional register of the prints constantly shifts to reflect Picasso's erotic and artistic obsessions, marital vicissitudes, and the darkening political situation in Europe...In the years Picasso worked on the series, fascism spread through Europe, and civil war erupted in Spain. These anxieties also found their way into the Vollard Suite, so that by the time you reach the end of the show and the last images of the blind minotaur, you feel that you are in a different emotional universe from the sunlit arcadia you encountered at the show\u2019s beginning\".\n", "\nArtist: Pablo Picasso\nArtwork Name: Guernica\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/guernica-1937\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGuernica is a mural-sized oil painting on canvas by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso completed in June 1937, at his home on Rue des Grands Augustins, in Paris. The painting, which uses a palette of gray, black, and white, is regarded by many art critics as one of the most moving and powerful anti-war paintings in history. Standing at 3.49 meters (11\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in) tall and 7.76 meters (25\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in) wide, the large mural shows the suffering of people wrenched by violence and chaos. Prominent in the composition are a gored horse, a bull, and flames.\r The painting was created in response to the bombing of Guernica, a Basque Country village in northern Spain, by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italian warplanes at the request of the Spanish Nationalists. Upon completion, Guernica was exhibited at the Spanish display at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (Paris International Exposition) in the 1937 World's Fair in Paris and then at other venues around the world. The touring exhibition was used to raise funds for Spanish war relief. The painting became famous and widely acclaimed, and it helped bring worldwide attention to the Spanish Civil War.\r In January 1937, the Spanish Republican government commissioned Picasso to create a large mural for the Spanish display at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne at the 1937 World's Fair in Paris. At the time, Picasso was living in Paris, where he had been named Honorary Director-in-Exile of the Prado Museum. He had last visited Spain in 1934 and never returned. His initial sketches for the project, on which he worked somewhat dispassionately from January until late April, depicted his perennial theme of the artist's studio. Immediately upon hearing reports of the 26 April bombing of Guernica, the poet Juan Larrea visited Picasso and urged him to make the bombing his subject. However, it was only on 1 May, having read George Steer's eyewitness account of the bombing (originally published in both The Times and The New York Times on 28 April), that he abandoned his initial project and started sketching a series of preliminary drawings for Guernica.\r Guernica is a town in the province of Biscay in Basque Country. During the Spanish Civil War, it was regarded as the northern bastion of the Republican resistance movement and the center of Basque culture, adding to its significance as a target.\r The Republican forces were made up of assorted factions (Communists, Socialists, Anarchists and others) with differing goals, but united in their opposition to the Nationalists. The Nationalists, led by General Francisco Franco, sought a return to pre-Republican Spain, based on law, order, and traditional Catholic values.\r At about 16:30 on Monday, 26 April 1937, warplanes of the German Condor Legion, commanded by Colonel Wolfram von Richthofen, bombed Guernica for about two hours. Germany, at this time led by Hitler, had lent material support to the Nationalists. Later, intense aerial bombardment became a crucial preliminary step in the Blitzkrieg tactic.\r In his journal for 30 April 1937, von Richthofen wrote:\n", "\nArtist: Pablo Picasso\nArtwork Name: Dora Maar with Cat\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/dora-maar-with-cat-1941\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  Dora Maar au Chat (Dora Maar with Cat) is a 1941 painting by Pablo Picasso. It depicts Dora Maar, the painter's lover, seated on a chair with a small cat perched on her shoulders. The work is one of the world's most expensive paintings.  The canvas (50 \u00bd by 37 \u00bd inches / 128.3\u00a0cm by 95.3\u00a0cm) was one of many portraits of Dora Maar painted by Pablo Picasso over their nearly decade-long relationship. Picasso fell in love at the age of 55 with the 29-year-old Maar and the couple soon began living together.  This painting was made during the year 1941, when the Nazis were occupying France. In the 1940s, the painting was obtained by Chicago collectors Leigh and Mary Block. They sold the painting in 1963. After that, the painting was never shown until the 21st century.  During 2005 and 2006, Dora Maar au Chat, then owned by the Gidwitz family of Chicago, was shown worldwide as part of Sotheby's exhibitions in London, Hong Kong and New York. It came up for sale in an auction of Impressionist/Modern works held at Sotheby's on May 3, 2006 in New York and making it the second-highest price ever paid for a painting at auction. An anonymous Russian [1] bidder present at the New York auction won the work with a final bid of US$95,216,000, well exceeding the pre-auction US$50\u00a0million estimates.   The identity of the bidder, who spent more than US$100\u00a0million in total, and purchased an 1883 Monet seascape and a 1978 Chagall in addition to the Picasso, was a topic of much speculation. Apparently a novice bidder, though possibly acting as an agent for a more well-known collector, the anonymous buyer may have been unknown at the start of the auction even to Sotheby's officials. As of mid-2007, the ownership of the Dora Maar au Chat is still unknown to the general public, although rumors have focused on the Georgian mining magnate and former Prime Minister of Georgia Bidzina (Boris) Ivanishvili, who sold his Moscow bank a week before the auction for $550 m.  Dora Maar au Chat presents the artist's most mysterious and challenging mistress regally posed three-quarter length in a large wooden chair with a small black cat perched behind her in both an amusing and menacing attitude. The faceted planes of her body and richly layered surface of brushstrokes impart a monumental and sculptural quality to this portrait. The painting is also remarkable for its brilliance of colour and the complex and dense patterning of the model's dress. The powerful figure is set in a dramatic, yet simple setting composed of a vertiginously inclined plane of wooden floorboards and shallow interior space that is arranged in a manner reminiscent of Picasso's earliest manipulations of space in a cubist manner.  Dora Maar au Chat is one of Picasso's most valued depictions of his lover and artistic companion. Their partnership had been one of intellectual exchange and intense passion\u2014Dora was an artist, spoke Picasso's native Spanish, and shared his political concerns. She even assisted with the execution of the monumental Guernica and produced the only photo-documentary of the work in progress. She was an intellectual force \u2013 a characteristic that both stimulated and challenged Picasso and her influence on him resulted in some of his most powerful and daring portraits of his 75-year career. Among the best of them are the oils completed during the late 1930s and early 1940s, when Picasso's art resonated with the drama and emotional upheaval of the era and which Dora came to personify. The luminous Dora Maar au Chat was painted in 1941, at the beginning of the Second World War in France.\n", "\nArtist: Pablo Picasso\nArtwork Name: Bull's Head\nArtwork Genre: sculpture\nArtwork Media: assemblage,objet trouve\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/bulls-head-1942\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBull's Head (French: T\u00eate de taureau) is a found object artwork by Pablo Picasso, created in 1942 from seat and handlebars of a bicycle.

Visitors were shocked by Picasso's new works and a demonstration took place, during which Bicycle Seat was one of the pieces removed from the wall.  Bull's Head is described by art critic Eric Gibson as unique amongst Picasso's sculptures for its 'transparency' - the constituent found objects are not disguised.  He says the sculpture is \"a moment of wit and whimsy ...both childlike and highly sophisticated in its simplicity, it stands as an assertion of the transforming power of the human imagination at a time when human values were under siege.\"  The sculpture is in the permanent collection of the Picasso Museum in Paris.

This is one of the earliest known works by Dal\u00ed, having been painted when he was about six years old.\r At the beginning of Dal\u00ed's career, his primary influence was from the Impressionist movement. This painting is one of the purest examples of Dal\u00ed's impressionist period. Over the next ten years he would use increasingly brilliant colors and lighting until the 1920s, when he began creating cubist and Surrealist compositions.\r This work was done during Dal\u00ed's first, \"Developmental Period\" which roughly lasted until 1928-1929. This period predates Surrealism and during this time he emulated and mastered existing styles of art, most notably the Baroque, Classical, Impressionistic, Cubist forms. Accordingly, the work exemplifies Dal\u00ed's early interest in impressionism.\r Landscape Near Figueras was painted in oil over a 14 x 9 cm postcard. The sky was painted thinly, allowing part of the design of the postcard to show through. It was part of the private collection of Mr. Albert Field in Astoria, Queens, New York but now is part of the permanent collection of the Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n", "\nArtist: Salvador Dali\nArtwork Name: The Great Masturbator\nArtwork Genre: symbolic painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-great-masturbator-1929\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Great Masturbator (1929) is a painting by Salvador Dal\u00ed executed during the surrealist epoch, and is currently displayed at Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda, Madrid.  The center of the painting has a distorted human face in profile looking downwards, based on the shape of a natural rock formation at Cap de Creus along the sea-shore of Catalonia. A similar profile is seen in Dal\u00ed's more famous painting of two years later, The Persistence of Memory. A nude female figure (resembling Dal\u00ed's then new muse, Gala) rises from the back of the head; this may be the masturbatory fantasy suggested by the title. The woman's mouth is near a thinly clad male crotch, a suggestion that fellatio may take place. The male figure seen only from the waist down has bleeding fresh cuts on his knees.  Below the central profile head, on its mouth, is a grasshopper, an insect Dali referred to several times in his writings.  A swarm of ants (a popular motif representing sexual anxiety in Dal\u00ed's work) gather on the grasshopper's abdomen, as well as on the prone face. In the landscape below, three other figures are arranged, along with an egg (commonly used as a symbol of fertility) and sparse other features. Two of the characters in the landscape are arranged in such a way as to cast a long single shadow, while the other character is seen hurriedly walking into the distance on the peripheries of the canvas. On the back of the central head figure, a formation of two rocks and a potted dry plant can be seen, the pot of the plant placed over the bottom rock while balancing the other rock on top of it in an unrealistic way. This part is thought to represent the escape-of-reality idea found in many of Dal\u00ed's other artworks.  The painting may represent Dal\u00ed's severely conflicted attitudes towards sexual intercourse. In Dal\u00ed's youth, his father had left out a book with explicit photos of people suffering from advanced untreated venereal diseases to \"educate\" the boy. The photos of grotesquely damaged diseased genitalia fascinated and horrified young Dal\u00ed, and he continued to associate sex with putrefaction and decay into his adulthood.  Comparisons have been made to Hieronymus Bosch's The Garden of Earthly Delights. The Great Masturbator is similar to an image on the right side of the left panel of The Garden of Earthly Delights composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.  Dal\u00ed kept the painting in his personal collection, displayed at the Dal\u00ed Theatre and Museum in Figueres, willing it to the national collection of Spain upon his death, when it was removed to the Madrid museum.\n", "\nArtist: Salvador Dali\nArtwork Name: The Persistence of Memory\nArtwork Genre: symbolic painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-persistence-of-memory-1931\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Persistence of Memory (Spanish: La persistencia de la memoria) is a 1931 painting by artist Salvador Dal\u00ed, and one of his most recognizable works. First shown at the Julien Levy Gallery in 1932, since 1934 the painting has been in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, which received it from an anonymous donor. It is widely recognized and frequently referenced in popular culture, and sometimes referred to by more descriptive (though incorrect) titles, such as \"Melting Clocks\", \"The Soft Watches\" or \"The Melting Watches\".  The well-known surrealist piece introduced the image of the soft melting pocket watch. It epitomizes Dal\u00ed's theory of \"softness\" and \"hardness\", which was central to his thinking at the time. As Dawn Ad\u00e8s wrote, \"The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order\". This interpretation suggests that Dal\u00ed was incorporating an understanding of the world introduced by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Asked by Ilya Prigogine whether this was in fact the case, Dal\u00ed replied that the soft watches were not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by the surrealist perception of a Camembert melting in the sun.   It is possible to recognize a human figure in the middle of the composition, in the strange \"monster\" (with a lot of texture near its face, and lots of contrast and tone in the picture) that Dal\u00ed used in several contemporary pieces to represent himself \u2013 the abstract form becoming something of a self-portrait, reappearing frequently in his work. The figure can be read as a \"fading\" creature, one that often appears in dreams where the dreamer cannot pinpoint the creature's exact form and composition. One can observe that the creature has one closed eye with several eyelashes, suggesting that the creature is also in a dream state. The iconography may refer to a dream that Dal\u00ed himself had experienced, and the clocks may symbolize the passing of time as one experiences it in sleep or the persistence of time in the eyes of the dreamer.  The orange clock at the bottom left of the painting is covered in ants. Dal\u00ed often used ants in his paintings as a symbol of decay. Another insect that is present in the painting is a fly, which sits on the watch that is next to the orange watch. The fly appears to be casting a human shadow as the sun hits it. The Persistence of Memory employs \"the exactitude of realist painting techniques\" to depict imagery more likely to be found in dreams than in waking consciousness.  The craggy rocks to the right represent a tip of Cap de Creus peninsula in north-eastern Catalonia. Many of Dal\u00ed's paintings were inspired by the landscapes of his life in Catalonia. The strange and foreboding shadow in the foreground of this painting is a reference to Mount Pani.  Dal\u00ed returned to the theme of this painting with the variation The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory (1954), showing his earlier famous work systematically fragmenting into smaller component elements, and a series of rectangular blocks which reveal further imagery through the gaps between them, implying something beneath the surface of the original work; this work is now in the Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, while the original Persistence of Memory remains at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Dal\u00ed also produced various lithographs and sculptures on the theme of soft watches late in his career. Some of these sculptures are the Persistence of Memory, the Nobility of Time, the Profile of Time, and the Three Dancing Watches.\n", "\nArtist: Salvador Dali\nArtwork Name: Rainy Taxi (Mannequin Rotting in a Taxi-Cab)\nArtwork Genre: installation,sculpture\nArtwork Media: objet trouve\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/rainy-taxi-mannequin-rotting-in-a-taxi-cab-1938\n\nWikipedia Article:\nRainy Taxi (1938), also known as Mannequin Rotting in a Taxi-Cab, is a three-dimensional artwork created by Salvador Dal\u00ed, consisting of an actual automobile with two mannequin occupants.

It was painted during a brief period when the artist lived in California.\r The trauma and the view of war had often served as inspiration for Dal\u00ed\u2019s work. He sometimes believed his artistic vision to be premonitions of war. This work was painted between the end of the Spanish Civil War and beginning of the Second World War.\r The painting depicts a disembodied face hovering against a barren desert landscape. The face is withered like that of a corpse and wears an expression of misery. In its mouth and eye sockets are identical faces.

A short, alternate title for the painting is Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee. It was painted in 1944, while Dal\u00ed and his wife, Gala, were living in America.\r In this \"hand-painted dream photograph\", as Dal\u00ed generally called his paintings, there is a seascape of distant horizons and calm waters, perhaps Port Lligat, amidst which Gala is the subject of the scene. Next to the naked body of the sleeping woman, which levitates above a flat rock that floats above the sea, Dal\u00ed depicts two suspended droplets of water and a pomegranate, a Christian symbol of fertility and resurrection. Above the pomegranate flies a bee, an insect that traditionally symbolizes the Virgin.\r In the upper left of the painting what seems to be a yelloweye rockfish bursts out of the pomegranate, and in turn spews out a tiger that then spews out another tiger and a rifle with a bayonet that is about to sting Gala in the arm. Above them is Dal\u00ed's first use of an elephant with long flamingo legs, found in his later compositions such as The Temptation of St. Anthony. The elephant carries on its back an obelisk, inspired by Bernini\u2019s Elephant and Obelisk in Rome's Piazza Santa Maria sopra Minerva.\r The bayonet, as a symbol of the stinging bee, may represent the woman's abrupt awakening from her otherwise peaceful dream. This is an example of Sigmund Freud's influence on surrealist art and Dal\u00ed's attempts to explore the world of dreams in a dreamscape.\r The elephant is a distorted version of the Piazza della Minerva sculpture Elephant and Obelisk by Gian Lorenzo Bernini facing the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome. The smaller pomegranate floating between two droplets of water may symbolize Venus, especially because of the heart-shaped shadow it casts. It may also be used as a Christian symbol of fertility and resurrection. This female symbolism may contrast with the phallic symbolism of the threatening creatures.\r It has also been suggested that the painting is \"a surrealist interpretation of the Theory of Evolution.\"\r In 1962, Dal\u00ed said this painting was intended \"to express for the first time in images Freud's discovery of the typical dream with a lengthy narrative, the consequence of the instantaneousness of a chance event which causes the sleeper to wake up. Thus, as a bar might fall on the neck of a sleeping person, causing them to wake up and for a long dream to end with the guillotine blade falling on them, the noise of the bee here provokes the sensation of the sting which will awaken Gala.\" The guillotine anecdote refers to a dream reported by Alfred Maury in Le sommeil et les r\u00eaves (\"Sleep and Dreams\") and related by Freud in The Interpretation of Dreams.\n", "\nArtist: Salvador Dali\nArtwork Name: Christ of St. John of the Cross\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/christ-of-st-john-of-the-cross-1951\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  Christ of Saint John of the Cross is a painting by Salvador Dal\u00ed made in 1951 which is in the collection of the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow. It depicts Jesus Christ on the cross in a darkened sky floating over a body of water complete with a boat and fishermen. Although it is a depiction of the crucifixion, it is devoid of nails, blood, and a crown of thorns, because, according to Dal\u00ed, he was convinced by a dream that these features would mar his depiction of Christ. Also in a dream, the importance of depicting Christ in the extreme angle evident in the painting was revealed to him.  The painting is known as the Christ of Saint John of the Cross, because its design is based on a drawing by the 16th-century Spanish friar John of the Cross. The composition of Christ is also based on a triangle and circle (the triangle is formed by Christ's arms; the circle is formed by Christ's head). The triangle, since it has three sides, can be seen as a reference to the Trinity, and the circle may be an allusion to Platonic thought. The circle represents Unity: all things do exist in the \"three\" but in the four, merry they be.  On the bottom of his studies for the painting, Dal\u00ed explained its inspiration: \"In the first place, in 1950, I had a 'cosmic dream' in which I saw this image in colour and which in my dream represented the 'nucleus of the atom.'  This nucleus later took on a metaphysical sense; I considered it 'the very unity of the universe,' the Christ!\"  In order to create the figure of Christ, Dal\u00ed had Hollywood stuntman Russell Saunders suspended from an overhead gantry, so he could see how the body would appear from the desired angle  and also envisage the pull of gravity on the human body. The depicted body of water is the bay of Port Lligat, Dal\u00ed's residence at the time of the painting.  The painting and intellectual property rights were acquired for Glasgow Corporation in 1952 by Tom Honeyman, then the Director of Glasgow Museums. Honeyman bought the painting for \u00a38,200, a price considered high at the time although it was less than the \u00a312,000 catalogue price, and included the copyright, which has earned Glasgow Museums back the original cost many times over.  The purchase was controversial and a petition against it, arguing that the money should be spent on exhibition space for local artists, was presented to the City Council by students at Glasgow School of Art. The controversy caused Honeyman and Dal\u00ed to become friends, corresponding with each other for many years after the original acquisition.  The painting first went on display at the city's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum on 23 June 1952. In 1961 a visitor attacked the painting with a stone and tore the canvas with his hands. It was successfully restored over several months by conservators at Kelvingrove and returned to public display. In 1993, the painting was moved to the city's St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art, but returned to Kelvingrove for its reopening in July 2006. It won a poll to decide Scotland's favourite painting in 2006, with 29% of the vote.\n", "\nArtist: Salvador Dali\nArtwork Name: Galatea of the Spheres\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/galatea-of-the-spheres\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGalatea of the Spheres is a painting by Salvador Dal\u00ed made in 1952. It depicts Gala Dal\u00ed, Salvador Dal\u00ed's wife and muse, as pieced together through a series of spheres arranged in a continuous array. The name Galatea refers to a sea nymph of Classical mythology renowned for her virtue, and may also refer to the statue beloved by its creator, Pygmalion.    Measuring 65.0 x 54.0 cm, the painting depicts the bust of Gala composed of a matrix of spheres seemingly suspended in space. It represents a synthesis of Renaissance art and atomic theory and illustrates the ultimate discontinuity of matter, the spheres themselves representing atomic particles.  Dal\u00ed had been greatly interested in nuclear physics since the first atomic bomb explosions of August 1945, and described the atom as his \"favourite food for thought\". Recognising that matter was made up of atoms which did not touch each other, he sought to replicate this in his art at the time, with items suspended and not contacting each other, such as in The Madonna of Port Lligat. This painting was also symbolic of his attempt to reconcile his renewed faith in Catholicism with nuclear physics. His friend, painter Antoni Pitxot, recalled that Dal\u00ed held in high regard the depth of perspective in the painting and the spheres he had painted.  Dal\u00ed wished for this painting to be displayed on an easel, which had been owned by French painter Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, in a suite of three rooms called the Palace of the Winds (named for the tramontana) in the Dal\u00ed Theatre and Museum in Figueres. It remains on display there to this day.

The portrait was commissioned by the Earl, and exhibited in 1779 at the Royal Academy before it was hung in Castle Howard. Reynolds was a chief proponent of the Grand Manner and, to that end, the roses Lady Caroline plucks from an urn may have been intended to suggest Chastity, Beauty, and Love, the attributes of Venus and the Three Graces.

There is the story of the real-life Mrs. Siddons who was a Shakespearean actress in the 18th century, and then there's the story of the Greek and Roman myth of Melpomene, the muse of tragedy. Both are explained below.\r Mrs. Sarah Siddons:\r Sarah Siddons was a well-known actress of the 18th century who became famous for her role as Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth. Born Sarah Kemble, aged 18 she married William Siddons, also an actor, and they had seven children of who only two survived.\r Sarah's parents sent her to work as a lady's maid and with this job she was exposed to the works of England's literary greats such as Milton and Shakespeare. She also began acting and had a natural ability.\r Eventually her marriage to William became strained and they separated from each other on their own terms.\r Her acting career prospered and she was offered a position at Drury Lane where she became infamous for her role as the Queen of Tragedy and eventually was the leading actress at the theater. It has been said she funneled all of her sorrows from the death of her five children and her unhappy marriage into her acting and was invited to do private performances for the royal family.\r Mrs. Siddons mixed with the well-to-do society of England throughout her life as well as knowing numerous playwrights and acting alongside the famous actor David Garrick, who was also frequently painted by Reynolds and Gainsborough.\r Muse of Tragedy:\r Melpom\u00e9ne is a character from Greek and Roman mythology, one of nine muses of the arts. She was originally the Muse of Song but then became the Muse of Tragedy. Singing was often utilized in Greek tragedies, which is how the transition from Melpom\u00e9ne's identification with song shifted to tragedy.\r The name Melpom\u00e9ne comes from the Greek word melpo or melpomai, which means \"to celebrate with dance and song. \"In many statues and paintings of Melpom\u00e9ne, she is represented with a tragic mask and also often holds in her other hand a knife or club.\r In Greek mythology, she is the daughter of Zeus and Mnemosyne, who had eight other daughters, Melpom\u00e9ne's sisters and the eight other muses are: Calliope, muse of epic poetry; Clio, muse of history; Euterpe, muse of flute playing; Terpsichore, muse of dancing; Erato, muse of erotic poetry; Thalia muse of comedy; Polyhymnia, muse of hymns; and Urania, muse of astronomy.\r Reynolds was inspired not only by Sarah Siddons' extreme talent to embody the tragic heroine in Macbeth, but also by the Classical subject matter of the muses from ancient Greek/Roman mythologies that numerous sculptors tried to create. Reynolds painted Siddons as Melpomene, the muse of tragedy.\r This work was painted when Mrs. Siddons was 28 years old and in the prime of her career. When she entered Reynolds' studio he took her by the hand and said, \"Ascend upon your undisputed throne, and graciously bestow upon me some great idea of the Tragic Muse\".\n", "\nArtist: Thomas Gainsborough\nArtwork Name: Cornard Wood, near Sudbury, Suffolk\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/cornard-wood-near-sudbury-suffolk-1748\n\nWikipedia Article:\nCornard Wood, near Sudbury, Suffolk is a 1748 landscape painting by Thomas Gainsborough, now in the National Gallery, London, which bought it in 1875.

Today it is one of his most famous works, but it remained in the family of the sitters until 1960 and was very little known before it appeared in an exhibition in Ipswich in 1927, after which it was regularly requested for other exhibitions in Britain and abroad, and praised by critics for its charm and freshness. By the post-war years its iconic status was established, and it was one of four paintings chosen to represent British art in an exhibition in Paris celebrating the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. Soon the painting began to receive hostile scrutiny as a paradigm of the paternalist and capitalist society of 18th-century England, but it remains a firm popular favourite.\r The work is an unusual combination of two common types of painting of the period: a double portrait, here of a recently married couple, and a landscape view of the English countryside. Gainsborough's work mainly consisted of these two different genres, but their striking combination side-by-side in this extended horizontal format is unique in Gainsborough's oeuvre, and extremely rare in other painters. Conversation piece was the term for a portrait group that contained other elements and activities, but these normally showed more figures, set engaged in some activity or in an interior, rather than a landscape empty of people.\r Gainsborough was later famously given to complaining that well-paid portrait work kept him away from his true love of landscape painting, and his interest probably combined with that of his clients, a couple from two families whose main income was probably not from landowning, to make a more prominent display than was normal in a portrait of the country estate that had formed part of Mrs Andrews' dowry.\r Thomas Gainsborough was about twenty-three when he painted Mr and Mrs Andrews in 1750. He had married the pregnant Margaret Burr and returned to Sudbury, Suffolk, his home town as well as that of the Andrews, after an apprenticeship in London with the French artist Hubert-Fran\u00e7ois Gravelot, from whom he learnt the French rococo style. There, he also picked up a love of landscapes in the Dutch style. However, landscape painting was far less prestigious and poorly paid compared to portraits and Gainsborough was forced (since the family business, a clothiers' in Sudbury, had been bankrupted in 1733) to \"face paint\" as he put it. Mr and Mrs Andrews contains the widest landscape of Gainsborough's portraits, and he would not return to such compositions. Future paintings would be set against neutral or typical rococo settings. It has been speculated that Gainsborough wished to show off his landscape ability to potential clients, to satisfy his personal preference, or his sitters' wishes.\r The relatively small size of the painting, just 2\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches (69\u00a0cm) high, is typical of both Gainsborough's portraits and landscapes at this early period. Later he painted larger portraits approximating life-size for a grander London clientele than his early depictions of local gentry, and the landscape backgrounds he used were mostly of woods and very generalized. Both his landscape backgrounds to portraits and his pure landscapes tend to show woodland, and the open farmland view seen here is unusual, especially as it begins so close-up to the viewer. Like most pure landscape paintings, Gainsborough's normally showed a view all seen from a certain distance, and that this landscape sweeps away from a foreground very close to the viewer is a feature necessitated by and typical of the portrait, though one that greatly adds to the success of the painting. As with almost all artists of the period, it was not Gainsborough's practice to paint outdoors, and Mrs Andrews did not in reality have to walk in her silk clothes across the fields to pose, one of the aspects of the work commented on disapprovingly by some modern writers.\n", "\nArtist: Thomas Gainsborough\nArtwork Name: The Blue Boy\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/portrait-of-the-jonathan-buttall-1770\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Blue Boy (1779) is a full-length portrait in oil by Thomas Gainsborough, now in the Huntington Library, San Marino, California.\r Perhaps Gainsborough's most famous work, it is thought to be a portrait of Jonathan Buttall (1752\u20131805), the son of a wealthy hardware merchant, although this has never been proven. It is a historical costume study as well as a portrait: the youth in his seventeenth-century apparel is regarded as Gainsborough's homage to Anthony van Dyck, and in particular is very close to Van Dyck's portrait of Charles II as a boy.\r Gainsborough had already drawn something on the canvas before beginning The Blue Boy, which he painted over. The painting is about life-size, measuring 48 inches (1,200\u00a0mm) wide by 70 inches (1,800\u00a0mm) tall. Gainsborough painted the portrait in response to the advice of his rival Sir Joshua Reynolds, who had written:\r The painting was in Jonathan Buttall's possession until he filed for bankruptcy in 1796. It was bought first by the politician John Nesbitt and then, in 1802, by the portrait painter John Hoppner. In about 1809, The Blue Boy entered the collection of the Earl Grosvenor and remained with his descendants until its sale by the second Duke of Westminster to the dealer Joseph Duveen in 1921. By then it had become a great popular favourite in print reproductions, after being exhibited to the public in various exhibitions at the British Institution, Royal Academy and elsewhere.\r In 1919, the painting inspired German film producer Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau to create his debut film Knabe in Blau (The Boy in Blue).\r In a move that caused a public outcry in Britain, it was then sold to the American railway pioneer Henry Edwards Huntington for $728,800 (\u00a3182,200), according to Duveen's bill, a then-record price for any painting. (According to a mention in The New York Times, dated 11 November 1921, the purchase price was $640,000, which would be over $8.5 million in 2014.) Before its departure to California in 1922, The Blue Boy was briefly put on display at the National Gallery where it was seen by 90,000 people; the Gallery's director Charles Holmes was moved to scrawl farewell words on the back of the painting: \"Au Revoir, C.H.\".\r It was this painting that moved pop artist Robert Rauschenberg toward painting. It is often paired with a painting by Thomas Lawrence called Pinkie which sits opposite to it at the Huntington Library.\r  Media related to The Blue Boy at Wikimedia Commons\n", "\nArtist: Thomas Gainsborough\nArtwork Name: Lady Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/portrait-of-georgiana-duchess-of-devonshire\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire is a painting by the English painter Thomas Gainsborough of the political hostess Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire. Its construction took place sometime between 1785 and 1787.\r During her years in the public eye, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire was painted several times by both Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds.\r Gainsborough's painting of her around 1785, in a large black hat (a style which she made sensationally fashionable, and came to be known as the 'Gainsborough' or 'portrait' hat), has become famous for its fascinating history. After having been lost from Chatsworth House for many years, it was discovered in the 1830s in the home of an elderly schoolmistress, who had cut it down somewhat in order to fit it over her fireplace. In 1841 she sold it to a picture dealer for \u00a356, and he later gave it to a friend, the art collector Wynn Ellis. When Ellis died, the painting went for sale at Christie's in London in 1876, where it was bought by the Bond Street art dealer William Agnew for the then astronomical sum of 10,000 guineas, at the time the highest price ever paid for a painting at auction. Three weeks later it was stolen from the London gallery of Thomas Agnew & Sons, a theft that was highly publicised at the time, and for years the newspapers printed stories about claimed sightings of the painting.\r However, not until 25 years later did it become known that the thief had been the notorious \"Napoleon of Crime\", Adam Worth. He had intended to sell it to come up with the bail to release his brother from prison, but when his brother was freed without bail, he decided to keep it for himself, for \"a rainy day\", and brought it to his homeland, the United States. In early 1901, through the American detective agency Pinkerton's, he negotiated a return of the painting to Agnew's son for $25,000. The portrait and payment were exchanged in Chicago in March 1901, and a couple of months later the painting arrived in London and was put up for sale. The Wall Street financier J. P. Morgan immediately travelled to England to obtain the painting and later claimed to have paid $150,000 for it.\r The painting remained in Morgan's family until 1994, when it was put up for sale at Sotheby's and was purchased by the 11th Duke of Devonshire for the Chatsworth House collection for $408,870.

It depicts the collapse of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham on 7 April 1778, during a debate in the House of Lords on the American War of Independence. Chatham is surrounded by peers of the realm, and the painting contains fifty-five portraits.\r Lord Chatham was the architect of the British victory in the Seven Years' War (1757\u20131763), in which Britain won supremacy in America. Although sympathetic to American grievances and against the use of force to subdue the Americans, he was opposed to American independence.\r On 23 March 1778 the Duke of Richmond proposed in the Lords to withdraw all British troops from America. This was defeated by 56 votes to 28. On 5 April he sent Chatham a draft of the Address in which he argued for \"entreating his Majesty to dismiss his Ministers, and withdraw his forces, by sea and land, from the revolted provinces...I am willing to hope that differences of opinion were more apparent than real, and arose only from want of opportunities to communicate and to explain.\" Chatham replied in third person: \"It is an unspeakable concern to him, to find himself under so wide a difference with the Duke of Richmond, as between the sovereignty and allegiance of America, that he despairs of bringing about successfully any honourable issue\".\r Chatham was determined to answer Richmond's motion and so on 7 April he went to the House of Lords, swathed in flannels, supported by crutches and leaning on the arm of his 18-year-old son William Pitt the Younger. Lord Camden wrote to Lord Grafton, describing Chatham as:\r Richmond in his speech said that as the Americans could not be defeated they were independent already and that recognising this fact was common sense. Lord Weymouth then spoke for the government. Chatham then rose in his place: \"He took one hand from his crutch and raised it, casting his eyes towards heaven...He appeared to be extremely feeble and spoke with that difficulty of utterance which is the characteristic of severe indisposition\". Chatham said:\r After delivering this speech Chatham suddenly pressed his hand to his heart and fell back in a swoon. The Duke of Cumberland, Lord Temple and other peers, along with Chatham's younger son James Pitt, hastened to assist Chatham. Chatham was then \"removed into the Prince's Chamber, and the medical assistance of Dr. Brocklesby, who happened to be in the House, was instantly procured\". He was then carried to a house at Downing Street and later that day back to his home at Hayes, Kent. Chatham, aged 69, died there on 11 May.\r Technically the title is a misnomer as his death did not take place until 34 days after the collapse portrayed and at home away from the Palace of Westminster.\r Copley positions Chatham beneath the tapestries depicting the defeat of the Spanish Armada made by Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom. Chatham's imperial vision of the British Empire resting on commercial expansion via the sea and his collapsing beneath the depiction of England's greatest naval victory are connected and symbolic.\n", "\nArtist: John Singleton Copley\nArtwork Name: The Major Peirson's Death\nArtwork Genre: battle painting\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singleton-copley/the-major-peirson-s-death-1784\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781 is a 1783 large oil painting by John Singleton Copley. It depicts the death of Major Francis Peirson at the Battle of Jersey on 6 January 1781.\r The Battle of Jersey was the last French attempt to seize the island of Jersey, and one of the last battles with invading forces from a foreign nation in the British home islands. The invasion was organised privately by Baron Philippe de Rullecourt but funded and supplied by the French government, and was intended to remove the threat that British naval vessel based in Jersey posed to American ships in the American Revolutionary War.\r Approximately 1,000 French soldiers, commanded by de Rullecourt and an Indian, Mir Sayyad, landed at La Rocque, Grouville, overnight on 5\u20136 January. They occupied St Helier early on the morning of 6 January. They captured the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey, Moses Corbet, in bed. Although Corbet surrendered, Peirson, the 24-year-old commander of around 2,000 troops of the British garrison, refused to surrender. As Peirson organised a counter-attack, a French shot killed him. Lieutenant Philippe Dumaresq of the Jersey militia took command of the British forces, which comprised detachments of the 95th Regiment of Foot, 78th Highlanders, and Jersey Militia. The British forces quickly overwhelmed the French, most of whom surrendered.\r John Boydell, a successful engraver and publisher and Aldermen of the City of London, commissioned Copley to paint a large painting, 251.5 centimetres (99.0\u00a0in) by 365.8 centimetres (144.0\u00a0in). The scene looks towards the final French resistance in Royal Square, viewed along what is now Peirson Place, with the French soldiers taking their last stand around the statue of George II. Further British reinforcements are visible on the hill at the top left. The statue and some of the buildings depicted still stand (some with bullet holes caused by the battle).\r Although Peirson was killed in the early stages of the battle, the painting shows Peirson (at the centre of the painting under the large Union Flag, supported by other officers) being shot down leading the final charge, giving him a more heroic role and fate. To the left, his black servant Pompey avenges his master by shooting the sniper. It is believed that the depictions of the officers supporting the stricken Peirson are true portraits; the black servant of auctioneer James Christie was the model for Pompey, although it is unclear whether a black servant played a role (there is no suggestion in contemporaneous sources). Copley modeled the civilians fleeing to the right on his wife, family nurse and children.\r Peirson became a national hero, and the painting drew crowds when it was first exhibited at 28 Haymarket in May 1784, with admission charged at 1 shilling. The Tate Gallery purchased the painting in 1864. Between 1989 and 2010, a copy appeared on the 10 Jersey pound note, and before that on the 1 pound note.\n", "\nArtist: Benjamin West\nArtwork Name: General Johnson\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/benjamin-west/general-johnson-1768\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGeneral Johnson Saving a Wounded French Officer from the Tomahawk of a North American Indian is a painting by Benjamin West, completed between 1764 and 1768. It depicts a scene as observed by a native of Pennsylvania, soon after the actual events shown. It is in the collection of Derby Museum and Art Gallery.\r The painting is important as it is a contemporary view showing all three powers involved during the 1750s in the French and Indian War (which could be called more comprehensively \"the British, French and Indian War\"). It depicts Major General Sir William Johnson preventing a North American native warrior from taking the scalp of Baron Dieskau, a wounded and defeated French soldier lying on the ground.\r West was an early American painter. He claimed to have been first taught how to make paint by a Native American childhood friend who demonstrated how paint could be made by mixing clay with bear grease. This painting has fine detail on the native figure, whose plucked scalp and tattoos are shown in more detail than the Europeans' uniforms. West is known to have had a collection of North American artefacts which he used in his paintings.\r Benjamin West probably began this painting soon after his arrival in London, in 1763, when West returned from Italy, where he spent three years. Following The Indian Family, a painting of about 1761, this one demonstrates the same willingness to show \"the proper dress and accoutrement\". Thus it provides us with one of two known contemporary pictures of the British Light Infantrymen for the French and Indian War period. Whereas in the Italian painting, accuracy and authenticity were intended to give a generic representation of the Indian life, the new one employed them to make a report of a recent historical event.\r Although the subject matter and some \"physical and symbolic details\" could be found more closely corresponding to the Battle of Fort Niagara (1759), the painting is usually related to an incident that occurred during the campaign of 1755 around Lake George, when the French commanded by Baron Dieskau, with their Indian allies, were opposed by a mixed troop of Mohawk and New England militia, led by Johnson. After having repulsed an attack against their camp, the British and their auxiliaries took over. Dieskau, wounded three times, had his life saved by Johnson, who protected him from the Mohawks wanting revenge for their killed kinsmen. He actually survived and was taken as a prisoner to New York, then to London, and then to Bath for treatment of a still unhealed wound. At the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, he was repatriated to France, where he died in 1767.\r West returned to the American war in his The Death of General Wolfe, exhibited in 1771, a much larger work that made his reputation, though causing controversy through its use of contemporary costume.\r By showing Johnson restraining the aggressive actions of an auxiliary, the painting promotes \"civilized\" standards of honor and laws of war, as opposed to the ferocity of \"savages\". It refers to the concerns and debates that the employment of Indian allies aroused among Europeans, throughout the conflicts in North America. Johnson's act of humanity contrasts against Johnson's reputation which has included him being described as a \"White Savage\" for his general attitude.\n", "\nArtist: Benjamin West\nArtwork Name: The Death of General Wolfe\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/benjamin-west/the-death-of-general-wolfe-1770\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Death of General Wolfe is a well-known 1770 painting by Anglo-American artist Benjamin West depicting the death of British General James Wolfe at the 1759 Battle of Quebec during the French and Indian War (which was the North American theater of the Seven Years' War). It is an oil on canvas of the Enlightenment period. West made an additional and nearly identical painting of the same scene for George III of the United Kingdom in 1771.\r The Death of General Wolfe depicts the Battle of Quebec, also known as the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, on September 13, 1759. This was a pivotal event in the Seven Years' War and decided the fate of France's colonies in North America.\r The battle was fought between the British Navy and Army and the French Army lasting only fifteen minutes. The British Army was commanded by General Wolfe. Though successful in holding the British line against the French and winning the battle, General Wolfe was killed by several musket wounds.\r In death, General Wolfe gained fame as a national hero and became an icon of the Seven Years' War and British dominance in late eighteenth century North America.\r West depicts General Wolfe as a Christ-like figure. This painting has a triangular composition, made by the top of the flag (as the apex) and the positions of the men. It resembles Christian \"Lamentation\" scenes, where Christ is held in the embrace of the Virgin Mary.\r Captain Hervey Smythe is pictured holding Wolfe's right arm.\r The depiction of the Indigenous warrior in the painting\u2014kneeling with his chin on his fist, looking at General Wolfe\u2014has been analyzed in various ways. In art, the touching of one's face with one's hand is a sign of deep thought and intelligence (thus Rodin's The Thinker). Some consider it an idealization inspired by the noble savage concept (Fryd, 75). Original items of clothing that were used as a model for portraying the warrior in the painting can be found in the British Museum's collection (as well as additional First Nation artefacts used in other paintings by West).\r On the ground in front of Wolfe are his musket, cartridge box, and bayonet. Wolfe went into battle armed as his men were, although his musket was of higher quality. His dress is also of note. He is wearing a red coat, a red waistcoat, red breeches, and a white shirt. Such dress was rather simple, especially for a commanding officer.\r Next to Wolfe, in the blue jacket, is Dr Thomas Hinde, who is attempting to stem the bleeding from Wolfe's wounds. The general later died in the doctor's hands.\r In the background, and to the left of the men surrounding Wolfe, an approaching runner is depicted. He is waving his hat in one hand to attract their attention, and with the other hand carries a captured flag with the Fleur-de-lis (a symbol of France)\u2014symbolic of the news relayed to the dying Wolfe that the French were being defeated.\r The inclusion of Simon Fraser, Lieutenant Colonel of the 78th Fraser Highlanders (behind the man in green uniform, identified in the painting as Sir William Johnson) is interesting, as General Wolfe had always spoken highly of Fraser's regiment, yet Fraser was not at the battle, as he was recovering from wounds received earlier. In the painting, Fraser wears the Fraser tartan, which was probably worn by officers in that regiment. All in all only four of the fourteen men depicted were actually at the battleground.\n", "\nArtist: Benjamin West\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Colonel Guy Johnson and Karonghyontye\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/benjamin-west/portrait-of-colonel-guy-johnson-and-karonghyontye-1776\n\nWikipedia Article:\nColonel Guy Johnson and Karonghyontye (Captain David Hill) is a 1776 portrait by Benjamin West, an Anglo-American painter of historical scenes around and after the time of the American War of Independence. Benjamin West was among the founders of the Royal Academy in London, serving a its president from 1792 to 1805 and 1806 to 1820.\r The portrait depicts the military officer and diplomat Guy Johnson and the Mohawk chief Karonghyontye (who also went by the English name of David Hill). Johnson was the British superintendent of northeastern America's six Indian nations and commissioned the portrait in 1776 while in London to secure that royal appointment. Sailing from Canada, Johnson must have been accompanied by his close friend Karonghyontye.The alliance between British forces and several Indian tribes seriously threatened the rebel colonists' chances of victory during the Revolutionary War.\r In the portrait Benjamin West signifies Johnson's role as ambassador to the Indians by equipping him in a red-coated uniform with moccasins, wampum belt, Indian blanket, and Mohawk cap. Karonghyontye is shown pointing to a peace pipe, while Johnson grasps a musket. This could suggests that harmony between Europeans and Indians will be maintained at all costs. The concept of cooperation extends to the background, where an Indian family gathers peacefully before a British military tent.\n", "\nArtist: Henry Fuseli\nArtwork Name: The Nightmare\nArtwork Genre: symbolic painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/henry-fuseli/the-nightmare-1781\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Nightmare is a 1781 oil painting by Anglo-Swiss artist Henry Fuseli. It shows a woman in deep sleep with her arms thrown below her, and with a demonic and apelike incubus crouched on her chest.\r The painting's dreamlike and haunting erotic evocation of infatuation and obsession was a huge popular success. After its first exhibition, at the 1782 Royal Academy of London, critics and patrons reacted with horrified fascination and the work became widely popular, to the extent that it was parodied in political satire and an engraved version was widely distributed. In response, Fuseli produced at least three other versions.\r Interpretations vary. The canvas seems to portray simultaneously a dreaming woman and the content of her nightmare. The incubus and horse's head refer to contemporary belief and folklore about nightmares, but have been ascribed more specific meanings by some theorists. Contemporary critics were taken aback by the overt sexuality of the painting, since interpreted by some scholars as anticipating Jungian ideas about the unconscious.\r The Nightmare simultaneously offers both the image of a dream\u2014by indicating the effect of the nightmare on the woman\u2014and a dream image\u2014in symbolically portraying the sleeping vision. It depicts a sleeping woman draped over the end of a bed with her head hanging down, exposing her long neck. She is surmounted by an incubus that peers out at the viewer. The sleeper seems lifeless and, lying on her back, takes a position then believed to encourage nightmares. Her brilliant coloration is set against the darker reds, yellows, and ochres of the background; Fuseli used a chiaroscuro effect to create strong contrasts between light and shade. The interior is contemporary and fashionable and contains a small table on which rests a mirror, phial, and book. The room is hung with red velvet curtains which drape behind the bed. Emerging from a parting in the curtain is the head of a horse with bold, featureless eyes.\r For contemporary viewers, The Nightmare invoked the relationship of the incubus and the horse (mare) to nightmares. The work was likely inspired by the waking dreams experienced by Fuseli and his contemporaries, who found that these experiences related to folkloric beliefs like the Germanic tales about demons and witches that possessed people who slept alone. In these stories, men were visited by horses or hags, giving rise to the terms \"hag-riding\" and \"mare-riding\", and women were believed to engage in sex with the devil. The etymology of the word \"nightmare\", however, does not relate to horses. Rather, the word is derived from mara, a Scandinavian mythological term referring to a spirit sent to torment or suffocate sleepers. The early meaning of \"nightmare\" included the sleeper's experience of weight on the chest combined with sleep paralysis, dyspnea, or a feeling of dread. The painting incorporates a variety of imagery associated with these ideas, depicting a mare's head and a demon crouched atop the woman.\r Sleep and dreams were common subjects for the Z\u00fcrich-born Henry Fuseli, though The Nightmare is unique among his paintings for its lack of reference to literary or religious themes (Fuseli was an ordained minister). His first known painting is Joseph Interpreting the Dreams of the Butler and Baker of Pharaoh (1768), and later he produced The Shepherd's Dream (1798) inspired by John Milton's Paradise Lost, and Richard III Visited by Ghosts (1798) based on Shakespeare's play.\n", "\nArtist: Angelica Kauffman\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Johann Joachim Winckelmann\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/angelica-kauffman/portrait-of-johann-joachim-winckelmann-1764\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Winckelmann is a 1764 painting by Angelica Kauffmann.

It was practically unknown until about 1949, but has since become one of Scotland's best-known paintings. It is considered an icon of Scottish culture, painted during one of the most remarkable periods in the country's history, the Scottish Enlightenment.\r The minister portrayed in this painting is Robert Walker. He was a Church of Scotland minister who was born on 30 April 1755 in Monkton, Ayrshire. When Walker was a child, his father had been minister of the Scots Kirk in Rotterdam, so the young Robert almost certainly learnt to skate on the frozen canals of the Netherlands. He was licensed by the Presbytery of Edinburgh in 1770 at the age of fifteen. He married Jean Fraser in 1778 and had five children. He became a member of the Royal Company of Archers in 1779 and their chaplain in 1798.\r He was minister of the Canongate Kirk as well as being a member of the Edinburgh Skating Club, the first figure skating club formed anywhere in the world. The club met on Duddingston Loch as shown in the painting, or on Lochend loch to its northeast between Edinburgh and Leith, when these lochs were suitably frozen.\r The painting is unusual in both its composition and its setting. The subject matter, perhaps intentionally conveying Walker's ties with Holland, is reminiscent of seventeenth-century Dutch artworks, particularly those of Hendrick Avercamp. The Reverend skates in the efficient but difficult \"travelling position\", with both arms folded across his chest and his stern black outfit contrasts with the wild backdrop of Duddingston Loch. According to Andrew Graham-Dixon, \"The pinkish grey crags and sky have been painted with great freedom, whereas the figure of Reverend Robert Walker himself is so tightly drawn and painted that he appears almost as a black silhouette against an icy, vaporous wilderness. Perhaps this was the artist's way of suggesting that, for all his apparent probity and self-restraint, the minister was at heart something of a romantic \u2013 a man, at any rate, with a penchant for communing with nature.\"\r Art historian Duncan Thomson notes that, \"The filigree within the buckle on the strap at the skater's right knee and the taut complexities of the arrangement of the pink ribbons that binds the skates to his shoes are a reminder of the manipulative skills that Raeburn must have developed during his apprenticeship [as a jeweller and goldsmith] ... perhaps the tour de force of observation and the finding of equivalent forms are the marks that the skater (or those who have circled with him) has made on the ice: the curving grooves incised with some appropriate tool in a liquid, greyish white which has been spread over a darker grey that has been allowed to dry and the edges of these tiny furrows, more pronounced towards the bottom of the picture, tipped in with a purer white to simulate the froth of ice thrown aside by the cutting blade.\"\n", "\nArtist: J.M.W.

The Author was in this Storm on the Night the \"Ariel\" left Harwich) is a painting by English artist Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775\u20131851) from 1842.\r Though panned by many contemporary critics, critic John Ruskin commented in 1843 that it was \"one of the very grandest statements of sea-motion, mist and light, that has ever been put on canvas\".\r An inscription on the painting relates that The Author was in this Storm on the Night the \"Ariel\" left Harwich. Turner later recounted a story about the background of the painting:\r He was 67 years old at the time. Some later commentators doubt the literal truth of this account. Other critics accept Turner's account, and one wrote, \"He empathized completely with the dynamic form of sovereign nature.\" This inscription allows us to better understand the scene represented and the confusion of elements.\r Turner had investigated the interactions between nature and the new technology of steamboats in at least five paintings in the previous decade. Throughout his career, Turner engaged with issues of urbanism, industry, railroads and steam power. The paddle steamer \"Ariel\" was formerly called the \"Arrow\", being built in 1821\u20131822. In 1837 she was acquired by the Admiralty and renamed \"Ariel\", and was used as the Dover packet up to 1846.\r Early critical response to the painting was largely negative, with one critic calling it \"soapsuds and whitewash\". John Ruskin, the leading English art critic of the Victorian era, though, wrote in 1843 in his book Modern Painters that the painting was \"one of the very grandest statements of sea-motion, mist and light, that has ever been put on canvas.\" Reportedly Turner was hurt by the criticism, repeating \"soapsuds and whitewash\" over and over again, and saying, \"What would they have? I wonder what they think the sea's like? I wish they'd been in it\". Ruskin commented, \"It is thus, too often, that ignorance sits in judgment on the works of genius\". More recently, art historian Alexandra Wettlaufer wrote that the painting is one of Turner's \"most famous, and most obscure, sublime depictions\".\r Currently in the collection of the Tate in London, it will be on exhibition at the De Young Museum in San Francisco in 2015.\r The painting depicts a paddle steamer caught in a snow storm. This marine painting is showing a Romantic era's painter's depiction of a snowstorm on water at its best, fully developing the bold, daring Romantic fantasy of Turner. Turner was unrivaled in depicting the natural world unmastered by mankind and exploring the effects of the elements and the battle of the forces of the nature. Turner worked first as a watercolorist, and he started to work much later with oils. He later applied the techniques he learned in watercolour onto oil paintings.\r It is typical of the late style of Turner. Turner's tints and shades of colours are painted in different layers of colour, the brushstrokes adding texture to the painting. The colours are monochromatic, only a few shades of grey, green and brown are present, having the same tone of colours. The silvery pale light that surrounds the boat creates a focal point, drawing the viewer into the painting. The smoke from the steamboat spreads out over the sky, creating abstract shapes of the same quality like the waves.\n", "\nArtist: William Holman Hunt\nArtwork Name: A Converted British Family Sheltering a Christian Priest from the Persecution of the Druids\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-holman-hunt/a-converted-british-family-sheltering-a-christian-priest-from-the-persecution-of-the-druids-1850\n\nWikipedia Article:\nA Converted British Family Sheltering a Christian Missionary from the Persecution of the Druids is a painting by William Holman Hunt that was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1850 and is now in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.

A Druid is visible in the background on the left pointing towards another missionary, who is being taken by one of the mob.\r A stone circle is noticeable behind the missionary but is visible only through gaps in the back of the hut used by the Christian family. The contrast between Christian and Druidic symbols is identified by the painting of a red cross over a stone within the Christian family's hut.\r The presence of the druid presumably locates the intended period of the scene before the Roman conquest of Britain in the mid-1st century, making the missionaries very early ones indeed, although the vestment-like clothes that they wear would, even to the well-informed Victorian, suggest a much later period.\r Hunt's painting was less controversial than Millais's companion piece, but Hunt was still heavily criticised for the odd composition and the contorted poses of the figures. In 1860, Florence Claxton's painting The Choice of Paris: An Idyll parodied the composition of Hunt's picture along with other works by the Pre-Raphaelite artists of the previous years.\r Hunt himself continued to believe it to be one of his best works. In 1872, referring to the painting as \"the Early Xtians\", he wrote in a letter to Edward Lear, stating that \"sometimes when I look at the Early Xtians I feel rather ashamed that I have got no further than later years have brought me, but the truth is that at twenty \u2013 health, enthusiasm and yet unpunished confidence in oneself carries a man very near his ultimate length of tether\".\n", "\nArtist: William Holman Hunt\nArtwork Name: The Light of the World\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-holman-hunt/the-light-of-the-world\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Light of the World (1851\u20131853) is an allegorical painting by the English Pre-Raphaelite artist William Holman Hunt (1827\u20131910) representing the figure of Jesus preparing to knock on an overgrown and long-unopened door, illustrating Revelation 3:20: \"Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me\". According to Hunt: \"I painted the picture with what I thought, unworthy though I was, to be by Divine command, and not simply as a good Subject.\" The door in the painting has no handle, and can therefore be opened only from the inside, representing \"the obstinately shut mind\". Hunt, 50 years after painting it, felt he had to explain the symbolism.\r The original is variously said to have been painted at night in a makeshift hut at Worcester Park Farm in Surrey and in the garden of the Oxford University Press while it is suggested that Hunt found the dawn light he needed outside Bethlehem on one of his visits to the Holy Land. In oil on canvas, it was begun around 1849/50, completed in 1853, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1854 and is now in a side room off the large chapel at Keble College, Oxford. The painting was donated to the college by the widow of Thomas Combe, Printer to the University of Oxford, Tractarian and a patron of the Pre-Raphaelites, in the year following his death in 1872 on the understanding that it would hang in the chapel (constructed 1873\u20136) but the building's architect William Butterfield was opposed to this and made no provision in his design. When the college's library opened in 1878 it was placed there, and was moved to its present position only after the construction in 1892\u20135 by another architect, J. T. Micklethwaite, of the side chapel to accommodate it.\r That the college at that time charged to view it persuaded Hunt toward the end of his life to paint a larger, life-size, version, begun about 1900 and completed in 1904, which was purchased by shipowner and social reformer Charles Booth and hung in St Paul's Cathedral, London, where it was dedicated in 1908 after a 1915\u20137 world tour where the picture drew large crowds. It was claimed that four-fifths of Australia's population viewed it. Due to Hunt's increasing infirmity and glaucoma, he was assisted in the completion of this version by English painter Edward Robert Hughes (who also assisted with Hunt's version of The Lady of Shalott). Hunt was buried in St Paul's.\r A third, smaller version of the painting, painted by Hunt in pastels between 1851 and 1856, is on display at Manchester City Art Gallery, England, which purchased it in 1964.\r The painting gave rise to much popular devotion in the late Victorian period and inspired several musical works, including Arthur Sullivan's 1873 oratorio The Light of the World. Engraved reproductions were widely hung in nurseries, schools and church buildings.\n", "\nArtist: William Holman Hunt\nArtwork Name: The Hireling Shepherd\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-holman-hunt/the-hireling-shepherd\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Hireling Shepherd (1851) is a painting by the Pre-Raphaelite artist William Holman Hunt. It represents a shepherd neglecting his flock in favour of an attractive country girl to whom he shows a death's-head hawkmoth. The meaning of the image has been much debated.\r Hunt painted the picture when he was living and working in close collaboration with John Everett Millais, who was painting Ophelia at the same time near the Hogsmill River near Ewell, Surrey. Both paintings depict English rural scenes, the innocence of which is disturbed by subtle but profoundly threatening violations of natural harmony. In Hunt's painting, the shepherd ignores his flock of sheep, who wander over a ditch into a wheat field. This violation of boundaries is paralleled by the shepherd's physical intrusions into the personal space of the young woman, who responds in an ambiguous way that might be interpreted as complicity or as a knowing scepticism. As he shows her the moth, he places his arm round her shoulder.\r Hunt used a local country girl Emma Watkins as a model. She was known as \"the Coptic\" by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood because of her exotic features. Watkins travelled to London to model for Hunt to complete the picture, but returned home after she failed to establish herself independently as a model. The model for the male figure is not known, but was probably a professional.\r When it was first displayed in the Royal Academy, it was accompanied by a quotation from King Lear:\r After it was exhibited, Hunt's enemies condemned the painting for its vulgarity, objecting to its portrayal of red-faced and sexually uninhibited country people. The Illustrated London News objected to the \"fiery red skin\" and \"wiry hair\" of Hunt\u2019s peasants (22 May 1852, p.\u00a0407). The Athenaeum was particularly offended by these \"rustics of the coarsest breed...flushed and rubicund\" from too much cider. It insisted that \"romp and rubicundity of this pair contrast with the pallor and pathos of Mr Millais\u2019s picture [Ophelia].\" (22 May 1852, p.\u00a0581-3)\r His supporters insisted that the painting was an unvarnished image of social fact. Hunt himself, however, hinted that he had a hidden meaning in mind, a claim he elaborated upon in a letter when the painting was acquired by Manchester Art Gallery. Hunt asserted that he intended the couple to symbolise the pointless theological debates which occupied Christian churchmen while their \"flock\" went astray due to a lack of proper moral guidance. This would make the title a Biblical allusion; in the story of the Good Shepherd (in the King James Version), the Good Shepherd is explicitly contrasted with a hireling shepherd, who has no care for the sheep [John 10:11-15].\r In 1859 Robert Barnabas Brough published a short story entitled \"Calmuck\" in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words. It was a thinly disguised account of Hunt's experience painting the picture and of his relations with his model Emma Watkins. Some of Hunt's relatives were shocked by the apparent implication that Watkins had come to London to be with Hunt. Hunt wrote an outraged letter to Dickens, who claimed to be unaware that the story was based on real events.\n", "\nArtist: William Holman Hunt\nArtwork Name: The Scapegoat\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting,religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-holman-hunt/the-scapegoat\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Scapegoat (1854\u201356) is a painting by William Holman Hunt which depicts the \"scapegoat\" described in the Book of Leviticus. On the Day of Atonement, a goat would have its horns wrapped with a red cloth \u2013 representing the sins of the community \u2013 and be driven off.\r Hunt started painting on the shore of the Dead Sea, and continued it in his studio in London. The work exists in two versions, a small version in brighter colours with a dark-haired goat and a rainbow, in Manchester Art Gallery, and a larger version in more muted tones with a light-haired goat in the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight. Both were created over the same period, with the smaller Manchester version being described as \"preliminary\" to the larger Lady Lever version, which was the one exhibited.\r In the Royal Academy exhibition catalogue Hunt wrote that \"the scene was painted at Oosdoom, on the margin of the salt-encrusted shallows of the Dead Sea. The mountains beyond are those of Edom.\" He painted most of the work on location in 1854, but completed the work in London in the following year, adding some touches in 1856 before it was exhibited at the academy in that year.\r The painting was the only major work completed by Hunt during his first trip to the Holy Land, to which he had travelled after a crisis of religious faith. Hunt intended to experience the actual locations of the Biblical narratives as a means to confront the relationship between faith and truth. While in Jerusalem, Hunt had met Henry Wentworth Monk, a millenarian prophet who had distinctive theories about the meaning of the scapegoat and the proximity of the Last Judgement. Monk was particularly preoccupied with Christian Zionism.\r Hunt chose a subject derived from the Torah as part of a project to convert Jews to Christianity. He believed that Judaic views of the scapegoat were consistent with the Christian conception of the Messiah as a suffering figure. He wrote to his friend Millais, \"I am sanguine that [the Scapegoat] may be a means of leading any reflecting Jew to see a reference to the Messiah as he was, and not as they understand, a temporal King.\"\r The Book of Leviticus describes a \"scapegoat\" which must be ritually expelled from the flocks of the Israelite tribes as part of a sacrificial ritual of cleansing. In line with traditional Christian theology, Hunt believed that the scapegoat was a prototype for the redemptive sacrifice of Jesus, and that the goat represented that aspect of the Messiah described in Isaiah as a \"suffering servant\" of God. Hunt had the picture framed with the quotations \"Surely he hath borne our Griefs and carried our Sorrows; Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of GOD and afflicted.\" (Isaiah 53:4) and \"And the Goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a Land not inhabited.\" (Leviticus 16:22)\r The reaction to the painting was not as Hunt expected. In his autobiography Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Hunt relates the first reaction to the painting by art dealer Ernest Gambart:\n", "\nArtist: William Holman Hunt\nArtwork Name: The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-holman-hunt/the-finding-of-the-saviour-in-the-temple-1862\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Finding of the Saviour in the Temple (1854\u201360) is a painting by William Holman Hunt intended as an ethnographically accurate version of the subject traditionally known as \"Christ Among the Doctors\", an illustration of the child Jesus debating the interpretation of the scripture with learned rabbis. The passage illustrated is from the Gospel of Luke, 2:41, which states:\r Hunt depicts the moment at which Mary and Joseph find Jesus, while the rabbis in the temple are reacting in various contrasting ways to his discourse, some intrigued, others angry or dismissive. This depiction of contrasting reactions is part of the tradition of the subject, as evidenced in Albrecht D\u00fcrer's much earlier version. Hunt would also have known Bernardino Luini's version of the subject in the National Gallery. At the time this was ascribed to Leonardo da Vinci.\r Obsessed with the idea of revitalising religious art by emphasising ethnographical accuracy combined with detailed Biblical symbolism, Hunt had travelled to the Middle East to create the picture, using local people as models and studying ancient Judaic customs and rituals. Progress on the painting was delayed by difficulties with models, and eventually Hunt postponed it to work on another project, The Scapegoat. He eventually completed it in 1860, back in England. His friend Frederic George Stephens wrote a pamphlet containing a detailed explanation of the content and the characters. It was then shown in a series of popular travelling exhibitions at which visitors could buy the pamphlet and subscribe to an engraved reproduction. These were organised by the dealer Ernest Gambart, and proved a great financial success.\n", "\nArtist: William Holman Hunt\nArtwork Name: Isabella and the Pot of Basil\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-holman-hunt/isabella-and-the-pot-of-basil-1867\n\nWikipedia Article:\nIsabella and the Pot of Basil is a painting completed in 1868 by William Holman Hunt depicting a scene from John Keats's poem Isabella, or the Pot of Basil. It depicts the heroine Isabella caressing the basil pot in which she had buried the severed head of her murdered lover Lorenzo.\r Hunt had drawn an illustration to the poem in 1848, shortly after the foundation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, but he had not developed it into a completed painting. The drawing portrayed a very different scene, depicting Lorenzo as a clerk at work while Isabella's brothers study their accounts and order around underlings.\r Hunt returned to the poem in 1866, shortly after his marriage, when he began to paint several erotically charged subjects. His sensuous painting Il Dolce Far Niente had sold quickly, and he conceived the idea for a new work depicting Isabella. Having travelled with his pregnant wife Fanny to Italy, Hunt began work on the painting in Florence. However, after giving birth, Fanny died from fever in December 1866. Hunt turned the painting into a memorial to his wife, using her features for Isabella. He worked on it steadily in the months after her death, returning to England in 1867, and finally completing it in January 1868. The painting was purchased and exhibited by the dealer Ernest Gambart.\r The painting portrays Isabella, unable to sleep, dressed in a semi-transparent nightgown, having just left her bed, which is visible with the cover turned over in the background. She drapes herself over an altar she has created to Lorenzo from an elaborately inlaid prie-dieu over which a richly embroidered cloth has been placed. On the cloth is the majolica pot, decorated with skulls, in which Lorenzo's head is interred. Her abundant hair flows over the pot and around the flourishing plant, reflecting Keats's words that Isabella \"hung over her sweet Basil evermore,/And moistened it with tears unto the core.\" Behind her, next to the doorway, are a pair of pattens, next to the edge of a cassone.\r The emphasis on sensuality, rich colours and elaborate decorative objects reflects the growing Aesthetic movement and similar features in the work of Hunt's Pre-Raphaelite associates John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, such as Millais's Pot Pourri and Rossetti's Venus Verticordia. The pose of the figure also resembles Thomas Woolner's sculpture Civilization, which was partly modelled by Fanny's sister Alice.\r Hunt's work influenced several later artists, who adopted the same subject. Most notable are the paintings by John White Alexander (1897) and John William Waterhouse (1907). Alexander and Waterhouse reproduce Hunt's title and develop variations on his composition. Alexander's composition adapts the subject to a Whistlerian style. Waterhouse reverses the composition, and places the scene in a garden, but retains the motif of the water-jug and the decorative skull.\n", "\nArtist: William Holman Hunt\nArtwork Name: The Shadow of Death\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-holman-hunt/the-shadow-of-death\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Shadow of Death is a religious painting by William Holman Hunt, on which he worked from 1870 to 1873, during his second trip to the Holy Land. It depicts Jesus as a young man prior to his ministry, working as a carpenter. He is shown stretching his arms after sawing wood. The shadow of his outstretched arms falls on a wooden spar on which carpentry tools hang, creating a \"shadow of death\" prefiguring the crucifixion. His mother Mary is depicted from behind, gazing up at the shadow, having been looking into a box in which she has kept the gifts given by the Magi.\r In 1850 Hunt's colleague John Everett Millais had already portrayed Jesus as a budding carpenter, helping his father as a young boy. Millais' painting, Christ in the House of his Parents, had been viciously attacked by critics because of the alleged squalour of the workshop. Hunt repeats many features of Millais's painting, but emphasises Jesus' physical health and muscularity.\r Hunt's portrayal of Jesus as a hard-working adult craftsman and labourer was also probably influenced by Thomas Carlyle who repeatedly emphasised the spiritual value of honest labour. It also corresponds to the emergence of Muscular Christianity, the view of writers Charles Kingsley, Thomas Hughes and others, who promoted physical strength and health as well as a vigorous pursuit of Christian ideals in personal and political life. Carlyle had strongly criticised Hunt's earlier depiction of Jesus in The Light of the World, identifying it as a \"papistical\" picture because it showed Jesus in regal clothing. The portrayal of Mary's thriftiness (by carefully \"saving\" the gifts) also fits the emphasis on working class financial responsibility promoted by contemporary evangelical publications such as The British Workman.\r The painting contains detailed typological symbolism, referring to the theological significance of Christ's role and identity. This may be related to Millais's contemporaneous Victory O Lord!.\r The painting was a popular success and was widely reproduced as an engraving. The profits made possible the donation of the original to the city of Manchester in 1883. It is now held by Manchester City Art Gallery.\r Diarist Francis Kilvert describes a visit to see the painting on display in 1874, the year after its completion. His entry for 27 June 1874 reads, \"I regret to say that against good advice and wise warning I went to see Holman Hunt's picture of the Shadow of Death. It was a waste of a good shilling. I thought the picture theatrical and detestable and wished I had never seen it.\"\r Hunt also painted a small-scale version of the composition in 1873. Hunt expert Judith Bronkhurst describes it as \"harder and crisper in appearance than the Manchester painting\". It was sold for \u00a31.8 million in 1994, which at that time was the highest price paid for a Pre-Raphaelite painting. It is held in Leeds Art Gallery.\n", "\nArtist: John Everett Millais\nArtwork Name: Christ in the House of His Parents\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-everett-millais/christ-in-the-house-of-his-parents\n\nWikipedia Article:\nChrist in the House of His Parents (1849\u201350) is a painting by John Everett Millais depicting the Holy Family in Saint Joseph's carpentry workshop. The painting was extremely controversial when first exhibited, prompting many negative reviews, most notably one written by Charles Dickens. It catapulted the previously obscure Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to notoriety and was a major contributor to the debate about Realism in the arts.\r It is currently housed in the Tate Britain in London.\r The painting depicts the young Jesus assisting Joseph in his workshop. Joseph is making a door, which is laid upon his carpentry work-table. Jesus has cut his hand on an exposed nail, symbolizing the stigmata and foreshadowing Jesus' crucifixion. Some of the blood has fallen onto his foot. As Jesus' grandmother, Anne, removes the nail with a pair of pincers, his concerned mother, Mary, offers her cheek for a kiss. Joseph examines Jesus' wounded hand. A young boy, who would later be known as John the Baptist, brings in water to wash the wound, prefiguring his later baptism of Christ. An assistant of Joseph, who represents Jesus' future Apostles, observes these events.\r In the background of the painting various objects are used to further symbolize the theological significance of the subject. A ladder, referring to Jacob's Ladder, leans against the back wall, and a dove which represents the Holy Spirit rests on it. Other carpentry implements refer to the Holy Trinity. Millais likely used Albrecht D\u00fcrer's print Melancholia I as a source for this imagery, along with quattrocento works. The sheep in the sheepfold seen through the door represent the future Christian flock.\r It has been suggested that Millais was influenced by John Rogers Herbert's painting Our Saviour Subject to His Parents at Nazareth. He may also have drawn on a painting depicting Jesus helping Joseph in his workshop, which at the time was attributed to Annibale Carracci.\r The painting was immensely controversial when first exhibited because of its realistic depiction of a carpentry workshop, especially the dirt and detritus on the floor. This was in dramatic contrast to the familiar portrayal of Jesus, his family, and his apostles in costumes reminiscent of Roman togas. Charles Dickens accused Millais of portraying Mary as an alcoholic who looks\r Critics also objected to the portrayal of Jesus, one complaining that it was \"painful\" to see \"the youthful Saviour\" depicted as \"a red-headed Jew boy\". Dickens described him as a \"wry-necked, blubbering red-headed boy in a bed-gown, who appears to have received a poke...playing in an adjacent gutter\". Other critics suggested that the characters displayed signs of rickets and other disease associated with slum conditions. Because of the controversy, Queen Victoria asked for the painting to be taken to Buckingham Palace so that she could view it in private.\r At the Royal Academy the painting was exhibited with a companion piece by Millais's colleague, William Holman Hunt, that also portrayed a scene from early Christian history in which a family help a wounded individual. This was entitled A Converted British Family Sheltering a Christian Missionary from the Persecution of the Druids.\n", "\nArtist: John Everett Millais\nArtwork Name: Isabella\nArtwork Genre: literary painting\nArtwork Media: paper,watercolor\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-everett-millais/lorenzo-and-isabella\n\nWikipedia Article:\nIsabella (1848-1849) is a painting by John Everett Millais, which was his first exhibited work in the Pre-Raphaelite style, completed shortly after the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848. It was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1849, and is now in the collection of the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.  The painting illustrates an episode from Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron novel Lisabetta e il testo di bassilico (1349 - 1353), reprised by John Keats's poem, Isabella, or the Pot of Basil, which describes the relationship between Isabella, the sister of wealthy medieval merchants, and Lorenzo, an employee of Isabella's brothers. It depicts the moment at which Isabella's brothers realise that there is a romance between the two young people, and plot to murder Lorenzo so they can marry Isabella to a wealthy nobleman. Isabella, wearing grey at the right, is being handed a blood orange on a plate by the doomed Lorenzo. A cut blood orange is symbolic of the neck of someone who has just been decapitated, referring to Isabella cutting off Lorenzo's head to take it with her after finding him buried. One of her brothers violently kicks a frightened dog while cracking a nut.  Millais and his colleague William Holman Hunt had both produced drawings illustrating episodes from the poem, but only Millais worked his up into a full painting (Hunt's 1868 Isabella and the Pot of Basil used a completely different composition). Both drawings used distorted perspective and angular poses characteristic of medieval art, by which the Pre-Raphaelites were influenced. Millais also draws on the precedent of William Hogarth's satirical depictions of an arranged marriage Marriage \u00e0-la-mode.  The painting is structured with deliberately distorted perspective, elongating the right hand side of the table and flattening the figures ranged along it. Following Pre-Raphaelite theory, Millais almost eliminates chiaroscuro and exaggerates the intensity of juxtaposed colours and tones - as evidenced in the flat black tunic set against the sharply modelled white cloth of the servant at the right, whose lower body virtually disappears as his yellow stockings semi-merge with the background.   Millais also carefully characterises each figure with equal precision. Another distinctive Pre-Raphaelite feature is the inclusion of images and patterns within the image as a whole. Each of the plates has a distorted picture glazed into its surface. The base of the bench on which Isabella sits contains a carving depicting a kneeling figure under which appear the letters PRB (standing for Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood).   The central motif of the thuggish brother's kicking leg and upturned chair further disturbs the equilibrium of the composition, as does the deliberately confusing \"crowding\" of the figures on the table and elaboration of motifs.  In 2012, British art curator Carol Jacobi published an article about sexual symbols in the painting. They were all on or near the character in the front left, who is stretching out his leg and using a nutcracker. The shadow on the table near his crotch area, his leg, and the nutcracker were all argued to represent a phallus. Jacobi said: \"The shadow is clearly phallic, and it also references the sex act, with the salt tipped into the shadow.\" She also argued that it would have been deliberate, but did not know what the painter's intention with it was. However, she stated that it was \"not a Freudian slip, or a hypocritical, furtive innuendo. The imagery of masturbation and the anxieties around it and being unable to control yourself sexually would have been well known.\"\n", "\nArtist: John Everett Millais\nArtwork Name: Ferdinand Lured by Ariel\nArtwork Genre: literary painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-everett-millais/ferdinand-lured-by-ariel-1850\n\nWikipedia Article:\nFerdinand Lured by Ariel is a painting by John Everett Millais which depicts an episode from Act I, Scene II of Shakespeare's play The Tempest. It illustrates Ferdinand's lines \"Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?\". He is listening to Ariel singing the lyric \"Full fathom five thy father lies\". Ariel is tipping Ferdinand's hat from his head, while Ferdinand holds on to its string and strains to hear the song. Ferdinand looks straight at Ariel, but the latter is invisible to him.\r The painting was Millais' first attempt at the plein air Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood style, which he did at Shotover Park near Oxford. He wrote to his close friend and Pre-Raphaelite colleague Holman Hunt that he had painted a \"ridiculously elaborate\" landscape. Referring to Hunt's belief in devotion to detail he wrote that \"you will find it very minute, yet not near enough for nature. To paint it as it ought to be would take me a month a weed \u2014 as it is, I have done every blade of grass and leaf distinct.\"\r He painted the face of Ferdinand from another Pre-Raphaelite, Frederic George Stephens. The clothing and the pose are derived from plate 6 of Camille Bonnard's Costumes Historiques, which represents the costume of a \"young Italian\" of the fifteenth century.\r The supernatural green bats were the last additions to the composition. Their grotesque poses put off the patron who had originally undertaken to buy it, since they were a radical departure from the standard sylph-like fairy figures of the day. They adopt the poses of \"see, hear, speak no evil.\"\r The invisibility of Ariel and the bats is suggested by their semi-merger with the green background. The connection with natural camouflage is implied by the presence of the green lizards hiding in front of the clump in the right foreground.\r The painting was bought by the collector Richard Ellison, and later entered the collection of Roger Makins, 1st Baron Sherfield who acquired several Millais paintings.\r Critical reception was initially mixed. The Atheneaum stated that it was \"better in the painting\" than Millais' controversial previous exhibit Christ in the House of His Parents, but \"more senseless in the conception\". The Art Journal identified \"a considerable vein of eccentricity\" in the portrayal of Ariel as \"a hideous green gnome\". The Times condemned it as a \"deplorable example of perverted taste\".\r In 1998, when it seemed as though the painting might leave Britain to be sold in the US, the columnist Kevin Myers, wrote that he would \"put my foot through it\" with \"violent joy\".\n", "\nArtist: John Everett Millais\nArtwork Name: The Return of the Dove to the Ark\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-everett-millais/the-return-of-the-dove-to-the-ark\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Return of the Dove to the Ark is a painting by Sir John Everett Millais, completed in 1851.

Ruskin was so taken with it that he wished to buy it when he first saw it, but it had already been sold to the collector Thomas Combe, superintendent of the Clarendon Press, who owned many other Pre-Raphaelite works of art.

It is held in the Tate Britain in London. It depicts Ophelia, a character from William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, singing before she drowns in a river in Denmark.\r The work was not highly regarded when first exhibited at the Royal Academy, but has since come to be admired for its beauty and its accurate depiction of a natural landscape.\r The painting depicts Ophelia singing while floating in a river just before she drowns. The scene is described in Act IV, Scene VII of Hamlet in a speech by Queen Gertrude.\r The episode depicted is not seen onstage, but exists only in Gertrude's description. Ophelia has fallen into the river from a tree overhanging it, while gathering flowers. She lies in the water singing songs, as if unaware of her danger (\"incapable of her own distress\"). Her clothes, trapping air, have allowed her to temporarily stay afloat (\"Her clothes spread wide, / And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up.\"). But eventually, \"her garments, heavy with their drink, / Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay\" down \"to muddy death\".\r Ophelia's death has been praised as one of the most poetically written death scenes in literature.\r Ophelia's pose\u2014her open arms and upwards gaze\u2014also resembles traditional portrayals of saints or martyrs, but has also been interpreted as erotic.\r The painting is known for its depiction of the detailed flora of the river and the riverbank, stressing the patterns of growth and decay in a natural ecosystem. Despite its nominal Danish setting, the landscape has come to be seen as quintessentially English. Ophelia was painted along the banks of the Hogsmill River in Surrey, near Tolworth, Greater London. Barbara Webb, a resident of nearby Old Malden, devoted much time to finding the exact placement of the picture, and according to her research, the scene is located at Six Acre Meadow, alongside Church Road, Old Malden. Millais Road is now nearby. Millais' close colleague William Holman Hunt was at the time working on his The Hireling Shepherd nearby.\r The flowers shown floating on the river were chosen to correspond with Shakespeare's description of Ophelia's garland. They also reflect the Victorian interest in the \"language of flowers\", according to which each flower carries a symbolic meaning. The prominent red poppy\u2014not mentioned by Shakespeare's description of the scene\u2014represents sleep and death.\r At an early stage in the painting's creation, Millais painted a water vole\u2014which an assistant had fished out of the Hogsmill\u2014paddling next to Ophelia. In December 1851, he showed the unfinished painting to Holman Hunt's relatives.

It is notable for marking the beginnings of Millais's move away from the highly detailed Pre-Raphaelitism of his early years. Effie Gray, who later left her husband for the artist, modelled for the principal figure.\r The painting depicts the wife of a rebel Scottish soldier, who has been imprisoned after the Jacobite rising of 1745, arriving with an order securing his release. She holds her child, showing the order to a guard, while her husband embraces her.\r The Illustrated London News reviewed the painting as follows:\r The dark, generalised background is a departure from the highly detailed backgrounds of earlier works such as Ophelia, as is the emphatic chiaroscuro. However, the portrayal of tense relationships disrupted by historical dramas was a continuation of the theme of A Huguenot and The Proscribed Royalist, 1651.\r While working on the painting, Millais fell in love with Effie, the wife of his principal supporter, the critic John Ruskin. A study for the painting has a drawing of her head on one side and an image of a man kneeling in supplication to a woman on the other, labelled \"accepted\".\r The title of the painting was adopted for the book The Order of Release by William Milbourne James about the love triangle, and also of a radio play about it broadcast in 1998. The painting of the picture is dramatised onstage in the play Mrs Ruskin (2003) by Kim Morrissey, and in the TV series Desperate Romantics (2009).\n", "\nArtist: John Everett Millais\nArtwork Name: Autumn Leaves\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-everett-millais/autumn-leaves-1856\n\nWikipedia Article:\nAutumn Leaves (1856) is a painting by John Everett Millais exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1856. It was described by the critic John Ruskin as \"the first instance of a perfectly painted twilight.\" Millais' wife Effie wrote that he had intended to create a picture that was \"full of beauty and without a subject\".\r The picture depicts four girls in the twilight collecting and raking together fallen leaves in a garden. They are making a bonfire, but the fire itself is invisible, only smoke emerging from between the leaves. The two girls on the left, modelled on Millais' sisters-in-law Alice and Sophy Gray, are portrayed in middle-class clothing of the era; the two on the right are in rougher, working class clothing.\r The painting has been seen as one of the earliest influences on the development of the aesthetic movement. \r The painting has typically been interpreted as a representation of the transience of youth and beauty, a common theme in Millais' art. Malcolm Warner argues that Millais was influenced by the poetry of Tennyson, at whose house he had once helped to rake together autumn leaves. Warner suggests that lines from Tennyson's song \"Tears, Idle Tears\" in The Princess (1847) may have influenced him:\r The apple held by the youngest girl at the right may allude to the loss of childhood innocence implied by reference to original sin and the expulsion from the Garden of Eden.\r After a positive review from F.G. Stephens, Millais wrote to him that he had \"intended the picture to awaken by its solemnity the deepest religious reflection.

They are resting by the roadside after a rainstorm, before travelling to the town of Winchelsea, visible in the background.\r The painting has been interpreted as an allegory of the senses, contrasting the experiences of the blind and sighted sisters. The former feels the warmth of the sun on her face, and fondles a leaf of grass, while the latter shields her eyes from the sun or rain and looks at the unusual spectacle of a double rainbow that has just appeared. Some critics have interpreted the rainbow in Biblical terms, as the sign of God's covenant described in Genesis 9:16.\r When the painting was first exhibited in 1856 it was pointed out to Millais that in double rainbows the inner rainbow inverts the order of the colours. Millais had originally painted the colours in the same order in both rainbows. He altered it for scientific accuracy.\r A tortoiseshell butterfly rests on the blind girl's shawl, implying that she is holding herself extremely still.

The children are carrying heavy burdens of wood for winter fuel. Though the title refers to the medieval poem Sir Isumbras, the painting does not illustrate a scene from the original text. However Millais's friend, the writer Tom Taylor, wrote verse in a pastiche of the original poem, describing the event depicted. This was included in the original exhibition catalogue.\r The background of the painting is based closely on a ruined medieval bridge which stood in Bridge of Earn, Perthshire (since demolished). Some of the village houses (in Back Street) can also be seen, though the tower house or castle to the left is imaginary.\r When first exhibited the painting was extremely controversial, and was attacked by many critics. Most notably, Millais's former supporter John Ruskin declared it to be a \"catastrophe\". The painting was also satirised in a print by Frederic Sandys, entitled \"A Nightmare\", in which Millais himself was represented as the knight. His fellow Pre-Raphaelites Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt were caricatured as the children, and the horse\u2014transformed into a donkey\u2014was branded with the initials of Ruskin.\r The original poem describes an arrogant knight who is humbled by misfortune in his youth, a story derived from the Book of Job and the legend of Saint Eustace. The subject depicted by Millais portrays the elderly, now humble, Isumbras after the events narrated in the poem. It was described by Frederic George Stephens as follows,\r The theme of the Christian Chivalry was a topical one at the time, discussed by Ruskin himself and other authors such as Charles Kingsley, who saw it as a means to overcome class division. It is comparable to the hymn Good King Wenceslas, written in the same decade, which also describes an aristocrat helping peasants who have been gathering fuel. Millais was also probably influenced by Albrecht D\u00fcrer's print, The Knight, Death and the Devil.\r Critical commentary on the painting when it was first exhibited was largely hostile, with many critics finding the horse over-large and ugly and the expressions of the children exaggerated. Ruskin (whose wife Effie had left him for Millais a few years previously) was extremely savage, condemning the picture for making errors in \"pictorial grammar\" by portraying the foreground as lighter than the \"more exposed\" hills in the background. He insisted that Millais had suffered \"not just a fall\u2014but catastrophe\".\r In response, Millais attempted to repaint parts of the picture before he sent it to another exhibition in Liverpool. The repainted version won a prize at the Liverpool exhibition. Millais altered the picture again in the 1880s, adding decoration to the reins and bridle.\r Despite its early bad reception, the painting became quite influential, inspiring a number of other images of chivalric knights. It was also taken up by political caricaturists, who took their cue from Sandys's caricature to replace the figures with politicians of the day, suggesting alliances between mismatched forces in attempts to \"carry over\" some piece of legislation. This tradition continued well into the 20th century. Some of John Tenniel's work for the Alice stories of Lewis Carroll has been sourced to paintings: \"The White Knight echoes Millais's Sir Isumbras at the Ford. \"\n", "\nArtist: John Everett Millais\nArtwork Name: The Vale Of Rest\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-everett-millais/the-vale-of-rest\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Vale of Rest (1858\u20131859) is a painting by John Everett Millais.\r The painting is of a graveyard, as night is coming on. Beyond the graveyard wall there is a low chapel with a bell. In the foreground of the scene, there are two nuns \u2013 the heads of the two nuns are level and symmetrical. They are Roman Catholic nuns, one of the nuns holds a rosary, and one of the nuns is digging a grave. Her forearm and body strain under the weight of a shovelful of earth.

It was inspired in part by the exploits of the Black Brunswickers, a German volunteer corps of the Napoleonic Wars, during the Waterloo campaign and in part by the contrasts of black broadcloth and pearl-white satin in a moment of tender conflict. The painting was originally exhibited with the plural title The Black Brunswickers, but is most commonly known by the singular form of the title.\r The painting depicts a Brunswicker about to depart for battle. His sweetheart, wearing a ballgown, restrains him, trying to push the door closed, while he pulls it open. This suggests that the scene is inspired by the Duchess of Richmond's ball on 15 June 1815, from which the officers departed to join troops at the Battle of Quatre Bras.\r In a letter to his wife, Effie Gray, Millais described his inspiration for the work, referring to a conversation with William Howard Russell, the war correspondent of The Times:\r The same letter states that he intends it to be \"a perfect pendant to The Huguenot\", Millais's first major success, which portrays a similar scene featuring two lovers gazing at each other longingly. Originally Millais intended the two paintings to be even more similar than they are by repeating the motif of the armband used in the earlier painting. He wanted the soldier to be wearing a black crepe mourning armband, with \"the sweetheart of the young soldier sewing it around his arm\". The armband idea was quickly dropped as it does not appear in any extant preparatory drawings.\r Millais reduced the presence of Napoleon to an engraving after Jacques-Louis David's Napoleon Crossing the Alps, which is framed on the damask-hung wall, and which \"perplexed the critics with the possible intricacies of cross purposes and rival jealousies\" according to the reviewer from Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. This refers to the fact that some critics took the print to imply that the female character was an admirer of Napoleon, and so she was trying to prevent her lover from joining the army for both personal and political reasons. As the critic of The Times surmised, \"her reluctance is due in part to a romantic admiration for this great conquerer.\" Other critics suggest the print was intended to allude to both the Waterloo campaign and to more recent events, particularly Napoleon III's repetition of his predecessor's crossing of the Alps by his attack on Austrian-controlled Lombardy in 1859.\r The artwork took an estimated three months to paint. Millais is reported to have paid particularly close attention to the correctness of the Brunswicker's uniform. Kate Perugini, the daughter of Charles Dickens, was used as a model for the woman seen in the picture. The male model was an anonymous soldier who died shortly afterwards. The two models never actually met. Millais' son says that they both posed with wooden props. He \"clasped a lay-figure to his breast, while the fair lady leant on the bosom of a man of wood.\"\r It was also bought for the highest price Millais had ever received from dealer and publisher Ernest Gambart\u2014100 guineas. He sold it on to the well-known Pre-Raphaelite collector Thomas Plint. Later, in 1898, William Hesketh Lever purchased the work for his private collection.\n", "\nArtist: John Everett Millais\nArtwork Name: Esther\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-everett-millais/esther\n\nWikipedia Article:\nEsther (1865) is a painting by John Everett Millais depicting the central character from the Biblical Book of Esther. It is from Millais's Aesthetic phase, when he was influenced by the work of Frederic Leighton and James McNeill Whistler.\r The painting depicts Esther, the Jewish wife of the Persian king Ahasuerus, as she prepares to enter the presence of her husband. As she is uninvited, she risks death, but does so to inform him of a plot against the Jews.\r Millais borrowed the Yellow Jacket, a gown given to General Gordon by the Chinese emperor after his defeat of the Taiping rebellion. In order to create a culturally unspecific effect, he turned it inside out, producing the abstract patterns visible in the painting.\r Millais creates a dramatic visual effect by vivid contrasts of colours, setting the deep blue of the curtain against the yellow dress and the white columns. The minimising of the narrative aspect of the scene is also in line with the Aestheticist approach of the artists he is imitating and challenging.\r Esther is depicted adjusting pearls in her hair, as she prepares to place her crown on her head. This gesture is derived from paintings by Titian, whose techniques of colouring Millais imitates, along with the modelling of the face and the characteristic \"Titian blonde\" hair. This also compares with the lush red locks of Millais's earlier picture The Bridesmaid and with some contemporary works by Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Millais's biographer Marion Spielmann wrote that the painting was \"the most modernly treated of Millais's early works...more consonant in its strong harmony with the audacious brilliancy of the present day [1898] than the more solid strength of forty years ago.\"\n", "\nArtist: John Everett Millais\nArtwork Name: Vanessa\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-everett-millais/vanessa\n\nWikipedia Article:\nVanessa (1868) is a painting by John Everett Millais in Sudley House, Liverpool. It is a fancy portrait depicting Jonathan Swift's close friend and correspondent Esther Vanhomrigh (1688-1723), who was known by that nickname, which Swift himself invented for her.\r Vanessa represents a major departure in Millais's art because he abandons fully for the first time the detailed finish that was still to be seen in Waking and Sleeping, exhibited in the previous year. Influenced by the work of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez and Joshua Reynolds, Millais paints with dramatic, visible brush strokes in vivid colours, creating what has been described as an \"almost violently modern\" handling of paint.\r Esther Vanhomrigh is known as \"Swift's Vanessa\" because of the fictional name he gave her when he published their correspondence. The portrait is wholly imaginary. No actual image of Esther Vanhomrigh exists, and we know very little about her actual appearance, although she was said \"not to be a beauty\". She is holding a letter, presumably written to or from Swift. Her sad expression is related to the fraught nature of the relationship, which was broken up by Swift's relationship to another woman, Esther Johnson,whom he called \"Stella\", whom he may have married secretly. Vanessa died soon afterwards. Millais also painted a companion piece depicting Stella.\r The painting is part of the 18th century revival in British art at this time, when a renewed interest in the brushwork of Reynolds and Gainsborough was emerging.\n", "\nArtist: John Everett Millais\nArtwork Name: The Boyhood of Raleigh\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-everett-millais/the-boyhood-of-raleigh\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Boyhood of Raleigh is a painting by John Everett Millais, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1871. It came to epitomise the culture of heroic imperialism in late Victorian Britain and in British popular culture up to the mid-twentieth century.\r The painting depicts the young, wide-eyed Sir Walter Raleigh and his brother sitting on the beach by the Devonshire coast. He is listening to a story of life on the seas, told by an experienced sailor who points out to the sea.\r The painting was influenced by an essay written by James Anthony Froude on England's Forgotten Worthies, which described the lives of Elizabethan seafarers. It was also probably influenced by a contemporaneous biography of Raleigh, which imagined his experiences listening to old sailors as a boy. Millais travelled to Budleigh Salterton to paint the location.\r Millais's sons Everett and George modelled for the boys. The sailor was a professional model. Millais' friend and biographer, the critic Marion Spielmann, stated that he was intended to be Genoese. He also argues that the sailor is pointing south towards the \"Spanish main\".\r The painting has been parodied many times in political cartoons.\r In 1870 David Low published a cartoon showing the Earl of Birkenhead (Secretary of State for India), Stanley Baldwin (Prime Minister) and Winston Churchill (Chancellor of the Exchequer) listening to \"Tales of the Dominions\" from a diminutive sailor (Leo Amery, Colonial Secretary - who was a very short man).\r In 1993 the Sunday Telegraph ran \"The Boyhood of Hurd and Major\". The then Prime Minister John Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who had recently pushed the Maastricht Treaty through Parliament against the wishes of many Conservatives, were shown as small boys in Elizabethan costume, listening as an old sailor (Sir Edward Heath) gestured towards the coast labelled \"Europe\" visible on the other side of the water. Former Prime Minister Heath - whose hobby had been yachting - had taken Britain into the EEC (as it was then called) during his premiership, and had grown up in Kent where the coast of France is visible on a clear day. At the time Heath was Father of the House of Commons and enjoying something of an Indian Summer after the ousting of his political nemesis, the eurosceptic Margaret Thatcher, as Prime Minister in 1990.\r In 1999 the Daily Telegraph published a Garland cartoon, showing the then Conservative leader William Hague as a small boy (this was common in satire at the time, as Hague had first attained national fame as a teenager in the 1970s), while two old sailors - former Foreign Secretary David Owen and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey - gestured inland and away from a ship labelled \"Euro\". The two elder statesmen described themselves as pro-European but opposed to British membership of the Single Currency.\r The picture has also appeared in recent explorations of postcolonialism, most notably Salman Rushdie's novel Midnight's Children, in which the narrator Saleem Sinai partly misremembers and transforms the meaning of the painting, a copy of which hung on his bedroom wall when he was a child.\n", "\nArtist: John Everett Millais\nArtwork Name: Victory O Lord!\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-everett-millais/victory-o-lord\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  Victory O Lord! (1871) is a painting by John Everett Millais depicting Moses, Aaron and Hur during the Battle of Rephidim against the Amalekites. Along with his landscape Chill October it represented a major turning point in Millais's career.  The painting illustrates a passage in the Book of Exodus, chapter 17, which describes how Moses and his two companions watched the battle from the hill. Moses holds the Rod of God in his right hand.  Millais depicts the \"going down of the sun\", when the three patriarchs watch the final moments of the battle. Moses is in the middle while Aaron and Hur hold up his arms to ensure victory. Aaron, in red, is on the right. The battle below is indicated by the arrow at the bottom right.    Millais worked on the painting over many years, scraping and repainting the surface. F.G. Stephens commented that the painting depicted the conflict between the unyielding and steadfast willpower of Moses, and the physical and emotional exhaustion of his companions. He also praised the vivid painting of the aged flesh of the figures. The painting contrasts dramatically in style with the contemporary religious works of Millais's former companion, William Holman Hunt, such as The Shadow of Death, on which Hunt was working at the same time; however, it has been suggested that both pictures may refer to typological prefigurations of the crucifixion in scenes in which raised, outstretched arms signify both physical suffering and triumph.\n", "\nArtist: John Everett Millais\nArtwork Name: Bubbles\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-everett-millais/bubbles-1886\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBubbles, originally titled A Child's World, is a painting by Sir John Everett Millais that became famous when it was used over many generations in advertisements for Pears soap. During Millais's lifetime it led to widespread debate about the relationship between art and advertising.\r The painting was one of many child pictures for which Millais had become well known in his later years. It was modelled by his five-year-old grandson William Milbourne James and was based on 17th-century Dutch precursors in the tradition of vanitas imagery, which commented upon the transience of life. These sometimes depicted young boys blowing bubbles, typically set against skulls and other signs of death.\r The painting portrays a young golden-haired boy looking up at a bubble, symbolising the beauty and fragility of life. On one side of him is a young plant growing in a pot, emblematic of life, and on the other is a fallen broken pot, emblematic of death. He is spot-lit against a gloomy background.\r The painting was first exhibited in 1886 under the title A Child's World at the Grosvenor Gallery in London.\r The painting was acquired by Sir William Ingram of The Illustrated London News, who wished to reproduce it in his newspaper. When it was reproduced and presented in the weekly newspaper as a colour plate, it was seen by Thomas J. Barratt, managing director of A & F Pears. Barratt purchased the original painting from Ingram for \u00a32,200 which gave him exclusive copyright on the picture. Millais' permission was sought in order to alter the picture by the addition of a bar of Pears Soap, so that it could be used for the purposes of advertising. At the time Millais was one of the most popular artists in Britain and he was initially apprehensive at the prospect of his work and his grandson being the subject of commercial exploitation. However, when he was shown the proofs of the proposed advertisements he grew to appreciate the idea, which portrayed the soap as if the child had used it to make the bubbles.\r Following the success of this advertisement Millais was attacked in print by the novelist Marie Corelli who accused him in her novel The Sorrows of Satan of prostituting his talent to sell soap. Millais wrote to her pointing out that he had sold the copyright of the painting and so was unable to stop the company from altering it in reproduction. Millais's son later claimed that he had tried to stop the advertisement being made, but had been advised that he had no legal power to do so. Corelli retracted her comments in a later edition of the book.\r The advertisement became so well known that William Milbourne James, who later rose to the rank of Admiral in the Royal Navy, was known as \"Bubbles\" for the rest of his life.\r Since A & F Pears was acquired by Lever Brothers, the painting has been in their ownership. It was lent to the Royal Academy, but was transferred to the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight in 2006.\n", "\nArtist: Frederic Leighton\nArtwork Name: Flaming June\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frederic-leighton/flaming-june-1895\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  Flaming June is a painting by Sir Frederic Leighton, produced in 1895. Painted with oil paints on a 47-by-47-inch (1,200\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a01,200\u00a0mm) square canvas, it is widely considered to be Leighton's magnum opus, showing his classicist nature. It is thought that the woman portrayed alludes to the figures of sleeping nymphs and naiads the Greeks often sculpted.  Flaming June disappeared from view in the early 1900s and was rediscovered only in the 1960s. It was auctioned shortly after, during a period of time known to be difficult for selling Victorian era paintings, where it failed to sell for its low reserve price of US$140 (the equivalent of $1,126 in modern prices). After the auction, it was promptly purchased by the Museo de Arte de Ponce in Ponce, Puerto Rico, where it currently resides.  Flaming June was first begun as a motif to adorn a marble bath in one of Leighton's other works, Summer Slumber. He became so attached to the design that he decided to create it as a painting in its own right.  According to art historian Andrew Graham-Dixon \"her pose is loosely modelled on that of Michelangelo's famous statue of Night, in the Medici Tombs in Florence, which Leighton regarded as one of the supreme achievements of Western art.\"The position of the sleeping woman gave Leighton a great deal of trouble. He made several preliminary sketches to determine the way in which she should lie; in particular he had difficulty making the angle of her right arm look natural. His studies show that the picture went through at least four evolutionary sketches before Leighton came to the end result. Out of these studies, four are nude and one is draped. The draped figure looks the least lifelike, demonstrating Leighton's need to draw from a naked model to achieve a fidelity to nature.  The toxic oleander branch in the top right possibly symbolizes the fragile link between sleep and death.  Flaming June has become Leighton's most recognisable picture. Samuel Courtauld, founder of the Courtauld Institute, called it \u201cthe most wonderful painting in existence\u201d. The realism of the transparent material worn by the sleeping woman, the stunningly rich colours and the perfectly recreated marble surround are characteristic of Leighton's work, as is his use of natural light.  He allows the sunset in the background to appear as molten gold.  The painting's first owners, The Graphic magazine, bought it to create a high-quality reproduction which was given away as a Christmas gift in 1895. When Leighton died in January 1896 it was put in their office window which was passed by the funeral procession.It was loaned to the Ashmolean Museum in early 1900s, its whereabouts after this are unknown; it was rediscovered in a Battersea home in the early 1960s, boxed in over a chimney. Andrew Lloyd Webber saw it soon afterwards in a shop on the Kings Road, but his grandmother refused to lend him the \u00a350 asking price, stating: \"I will not have Victorian junk in my flat\".  In 1963 Luis A. Ferr\u00e9\u00a0\u2013 the noted Puerto Rican industrialist and politician, who would be elected governor five years later\u00a0\u2013 was on a trip around Europe, engaged in purchasing paintings and sculptures for the Museo de Arte de Ponce in Puerto Rico, which he had founded. \"It\u2019s extremely curious to know that this work of such late Victorian importance was bought in Amsterdam by Luis A. Ferre for less than $1,000 dollars in 1960.\" The painting has also loaned to important exhibitions around the world. Flaming June was on display at the Museo del Prado in Madrid in 2008, the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart in Germany in 2009 and in the Frick Collection in New York City in 2015.\n", "\nArtist: Frank Holl\nArtwork Name: George Otto Trevelyan, Bt, OM, Honorary Fellow, Politician and Author\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frank-holl/george-otto-trevelyan-1838-1928-bt-om-honorary-fellow-politician-and-author-1886\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSir George Otto Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet, OM, PC, FBA (20 July 1838 \u2013 17 August 1928) was a British statesman and author. In a ministerial career stretching almost 30 years, he was most notably twice Secretary for Scotland under William Ewart Gladstone and the Earl of Rosebery. He broke with Gladstone over the 1886 Irish Home Rule Bill, but after modifications were made to the bill he re-joined the Liberal Party shortly afterwards. Also a writer and historian, Trevelyan published The Life and Letters of Lord Macaulay, his maternal uncle, in 1876.  Trevelyan was born in Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, the only son of Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet, and Hannah, daughter of Zachary Macaulay and sister of the historian Lord Macaulay. He was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was President of the Cambridge Union Society, and earned second place in the first class of the Classical Tripos in 1861. That same year he wrote his Horace at the University of Athens, a topical drama in verse, parts of which are said to have offended William Whewell and lost Trevelyan a fellowship. He was a Cambridge Apostle.  In 1862 Trevelyan went out as a civil servant to India, where he spent several years. In 1865 he was elected Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Tynemouth and North Shields. At the general election of 1868 he was returned for the Hawick Burghs, which he continued to represent until 1886. When the first Gladstone ministry was formed in December 1868, Trevelyan was appointed Civil Lord of the Admiralty, but resigned in July 1870 on a point of conscience connected with the government Education Bill. He advocated a sweeping reform of the army, including the abolition of the purchase of commissions, and both in and out of parliament he was the foremost supporter for many years of the extension of the county franchise. In the session of 1874 he brought forward his Household Franchise (Counties) Bill, which was lost on the second reading \u2013 it was not till ten years later that the agricultural labourer was enfranchised. Among other causes which he warmly supported were women's suffrage, a thorough reform of metropolitan local government, and the drastic reform or abolition of the House of Lords. He was also in favour of the direct veto and other temperance legislation.  In 1880 Trevelyan was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty under Gladstone. He held this office until May 1882, when, after the assassination of Lord Frederick Cavendish, he became Chief Secretary for Ireland and sworn of the Privy Council. From November 1884 to June 1885 he was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster with a seat in the cabinet. In February 1886 he became Secretary for Scotland and Vice-President of the Scottish Education Department in Gladstone's third administration, but resigned in March over Irish Home Rule. The same year he succeeded his father in the baronetcy.  At the general election of 1886 Trevelyan lost his seat for Hawick. As a representative of the Liberal Unionist Party he took part in the Round Table Conference, and, being satisfied with the changes made by Gladstone in his Home Rule scheme, he formally rejoined the Liberal Party. In August 1887 he re-entered the House of Commons as member for Glasgow Bridgeton. From 1892 to 1895 he was again Secretary for Scotland and Vice-President of the Scottish Education Department. He resigned his seat in parliament in early 1897 and retired into private life.

In 1898, the painting was bought from the Royal Academy exhibition through The Chantrey Bequest, a public fund for purchasing modern art bequeathed by Sir Francis Leggatt Chantrey, R.A.. The Lament for Icarus was subsequently awarded the gold medal at the Exposition Universelle of 1900 in Paris.  According to Dr. Justine Hopkins, Draper identifies Icarus \"with the other heroes of the Pre-Raphaelites and symbolists, who, like James Dean half a century later, manage to live fast, die young and leave a beautiful corpse\".  In 1890s Draper was focused mainly on ancient Greek mythological subjects. Frederic Leighton had depicted Icarus in 1869, but while Leighton showed the preparations for the flight, Draper depicted the tragic ending of the flight. For the composition Draper adopted Leighton's method of depicting separate figures, for which he employed four young professional models (Ethel Gurden, Ethel Warwick, Florence Bird and Luigi di Luca).  The use of the male body as a vehicle for the projection of subjective emotion, as in The Lament for Icarus, is a feature of late-Victorian painting and sculpture, and in The Lament for Icarus the body appears to melt within the arms of one nymph. Draper applied liquid light effects without abandoning form and used mainly warm colors. The tanned skin of Icarus refers to his close approach to the Sun before falling down. The rays of the setting sun on distant cliffs emphasize the transience of time. Moralizing, sentimental and sensual, The Lament for Icarus ultimately became a well-composed image of epic failure. However, somewhat surprising, Icarus has his wings fully intact, contrary to the myth where the wax melted and Icarus fell flapping his bare arms. The image of a \"winged creature\" is likely utilized to create a more symbolic, romantic and elegant appearance.\n", "\nArtist: William Orpen\nArtwork Name: The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles, 28 June 1919\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-orpen/the-signing-of-peace-in-the-hall-of-mirrors-versailles-28-june-1919\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles, 28 June 1919 is an oil-on-canvas painting by Irish artist William Orpen, completed in 1919.

The work is held by the Imperial War Museum in London.\r Orpen was one of the first people chosen as a war artist by the British Ministry of Information in 1917. Orpen was also official painter at the peace conference, and was commissioned to paint three canvases to record the proceedings. The work was the most expensive of the British public art commissions associated with the First World War: Orpen was paid \u00a33,000: by comparison, John Singer Sargent received \u00a3300 for his much larger painting Gassed.\r The painting depicts the signature of the Treaty of Versailles by representatives from Germany on 28 June 1919, to formally end the First World War. It is a group portrait depicting soldiers, diplomats and politicians who attended the conference, at the point when the treaty was signed in the opulent surroundings of Louis XIV's Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles.

The 1,000 guinea fee for the painting was funded by donations from members of the House of Commons and House of Lords. The painting was presented to Churchill by both Houses of Parliament at a public ceremony in Westminster Hall on his 80th birthday on 30 November 1954.  Churchill hated the portrait.  After the public presentation, the painting was taken to his country home at Chartwell but was not put on display.  After the death of Lady Churchill in 1977, it became clear that she had  the painting destroyed some months after it was delivered.  Churchill was an elder statesman in 1954, then towards the end of his second period as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  Sutherland had a reputation as a modernist painter with some recent successful portraits, such as Somerset Maugham in 1949.  He was drawn to capturing the real person: some sitters considered his disinclination to flattery as a form of cruelty or disparagement.  Sutherland and Churchill had very different conceptions of the painting.  Churchill hoped to be depicted in his robes as a Knight of the Garter, but the commission specified that he should be shown in his usual parliamentary dress \u2013 a black morning coat, with waistcoat and striped trousers, and a spotted bow tie.  Sutherland made charcoal sketches of Churchill at a handful of sittings at Chartwell from August 1954, concentrating on Churchill's hands and face, and then made some oil studies.  Sutherland also worked from photographs by Elsbeth Juda.  He took his preliminary materials back to his studio to create the final work on a large square canvas, the shape chosen to figuratively represent Churchill's solidity, reflecting a remark that Churchill made, \"I am a rock\".  The pose, with Churchill grasping the arms of his chair, recalls the statue of US President Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC.  Churchill is shown scowling, slightly slumped forward, surrounded by wintry grey, brown and black tones.  Sutherland was reluctant to discuss the work in progress with Churchill and showed the subject few of his working materials.  Churchill's wife thought it was a good resemblance \u2013 \"really quite alarmingly like him\" \u2013 but also said it made him look too cross, while recognising that it was a familiar expression.  Churchill's son Randolph thought the portrait made him look \"disenchanted\".    Churchill's wife viewed the completed portrait on 20 November 1954 and took a photograph back to her husband.  It was his first view of the work, and he was deeply upset. He described it to Lord Moran as \"filthy\" and \"malignant\", and complained that it made him \u201clook like a down-and-out drunk who has been picked out of the gutter in the Strand.\u201d With only 10 days to go, he sent a note to Sutherland stating that \"the painting, however masterly in execution, is not suitable\" and declaring that the ceremony would go ahead without it. Sutherland maintained that he honestly painted what he saw. MP Charles Doughty persuaded Churchill that the presentation had to go ahead, to avoid offending the donors.\n", "\nArtist: Andy Warhol\nArtwork Name: Marilyn Diptych\nArtwork Genre: figurative,portrait\nArtwork Media: acrylic,canvas\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/andy-warhol/marilyn-diptych-1962\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Marilyn Diptych (1962) is a silkscreen painting by American pop artist Andy Warhol depicting Marilyn Monroe. The piece is one of the artist's most noted works. It is in the collection of the Tate.  Silk-screening was the technique used to create this painting. The twenty-five images on the left are painted in color, the right side is black and white. The painting consists of 50 images.   The work was completed during the weeks after Marilyn Monroe's death in August 1962. The fifty images of the actress are all based on a single publicity photograph from the film Niagara (1953).   It has been suggested that the relation between the left side of the canvas and the right side of the canvas is evocative of the relation between the celebrity's life and death. The work has received praise from writers such as American academic and cultural critic Camille Paglia, who wrote in 2012's Glittering Images lauding how it shows the \"multiplicity of meanings\" in Monroe's life and legacy.  In a December 2, 2004 article in The Guardian, the painting was named the third most influential piece of modern art in a survey of 500 artists, critics, and others. The artwork was also ranked ninth in the past 1000 years by Kathleen Davenport, Director, Rice University Art Gallery, Houston.  The artwork was bought by art / design show organizer / collector  Emily Hall Tremaine out of Warhol's studio in 1962, among several other noted early works by Warhol.

Painted near Wheeling, West Virginia, it is conceived in a naturalistic style featuring realistic anatomical depictions of men and boys similar to that of Thomas Eakins, although Eakins never painted industrial subjects. Also like Eakins, Anshutz composed this painting with the help of photographs and studies. Some of the figures are depicted in a classical pose, such as the man in the foreground rubbing his arm. This figure's pose imitates a pose from the Parthenon. The piece was exhibited at the Philadelphia Sketch Club in 1881 and compared to Eakin's work by art critics. Art historian Randall C. Griffin has written of it: \"One of the first American paintings to depict the bleakness of factory life, The Ironworkers' Noontime appears to be a clear indictment of industrialization.

Painted in 1833, it is perhaps the most enigmatic of Cole's allegorical or imaginary landscape scenes. It is a work that \"defies full explanation\", according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Titan's Goblet has been called a \"picture within a picture\" and a \"landscape within a landscape\": the goblet stands on conventional terrain, but its inhabitants live along its rim in a world all their own. Vegetation covers the entire brim, broken only by two tiny buildings, a Greek temple and an Italian palace. The vast waters are dotted with sailing vessels. Where the water spills upon the ground below, grass and a more rudimentary civilization spring up.\r Cole often provided text to accompany his paintings, but did not comment on The Titan's Goblet, leaving his intentions open to debate. In the 1880s, one interpretation related Coles goblet to the world tree and specifically to the Yggdrasil in Norse mythology. A 1904 auction catalog continued this theme, writing \"the spiritual idea in the centre of the painting, conveying the beautiful Norse theory that life and the world is but a tree with ramifying branches, is carefully carried out by the painter\". It is not obvious, however, that Cole would have been familiar with this concept, and critic Elwood C. Parry suggests that the likeness to any mythological tree is limited to the similarity of the goblet's stem to a tree trunk. There is nothing about the goblet analogous to branches or roots.\r The scale of the massive stone goblet contrasts with that of the traditional landscape scene around it, inviting comparisons with the large stone objects left by ancient races of giants in Greek mythology\u2014a view endorsed by art historian Erwin Panofsky in the 1960s. The painting's title (given by Cole on the back of the canvas) seems to support this idea, as if much time had passed between the creation of this goblet and the current scene. The setting sun, a romantic symbol, also evokes the passage of time.\r The dominance of the goblet in the painting might suggest a cosmological interpretation. Parry considers but rejects a comparison with the exterior panels of Hieronymus Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights (c. 1500), which are generally taken to depict the creation of Earth. Both images are of a contained world, but use water and terrain in differing proportions. Cole's Goblet offers neither iconography nor an inscription that would confirm a religious interpretation of the picture. Furthermore, the painter has placed the goblet far from the center of the canvas, which minimizes its emblematic significance.\r The waters of the goblet, though, can be seen as a civilizing influence. The inhabitants of the goblet have a Utopian existence, pleasure boating on the tranquil waters and living among the temples and leafy woods. Where the waters spill onto the landscape below\u2014where the two worlds interact\u2014signs of life appear. In the background, far from the influence of the goblet's waters, the mountains are desolate and rocky. A similar depiction of civilization by the waterside can be seen in Cole's An Evening in Arcady (1843).\n", "\nArtist: Thomas Cole\nArtwork Name: The dream of the architect\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-cole/the-dream-of-the-architect-1840\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Architect's Dream is an 1840 oil painting created by Thomas Cole for New York architect Ithiel Town.

Its exhibition in 1859 was a sensation, and the painting established Church as the foremost landscape painter in the United States. It has been in the collection of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art since 1909, and is among Church's most renowned works.\r In 1853 and again in 1857, Church traveled in Ecuador and Colombia, financed by businessman Cyrus West Field, who wished to use Church's paintings to lure investors to his South American ventures. Church was inspired by the Prussian naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt, and his 1845 treatise Kosmos. Humboldt was among the last of the great scientific generalists, and his fame was similar to that of Albert Einstein a century later. In the second volume of Kosmos, Humboldt included a chapter on the influence of landscape painting on the study of the natural world\u2014ranking that art among the highest expressions of the love of nature\u2014and challenging artists to portray the \"physiognomy\" of the landscape. Church retraced Humboldt's travels in South America.\r The Heart of the Andes is a composite of the South American topography observed by Church during his travels. At the center right of the mountain landscape is a shimmering pool served by a waterfall. The snow-capped, majestic Mount Chimborazo of Ecuador appears in the distance; the viewer's eye is led to it by the darker, closer slopes that decline from right to left. The evidence of human presence consists of a lightly worn path that fades away, a hamlet and church lying in the central plain, and closer to the foreground, two natives are seen before a cross. The church, a trademark detail in Church's paintings, is Catholic and Spanish-colonial, and seemingly inaccessible from the viewer's location. Church's signature appears cut into the bark of the highlighted foreground tree at left. The play of light on his signature has been interpreted as the artist's statement of man's ability to tame nature\u2014yet the tree appears in poor health compared to the vivid jungle surrounding it.\r Church's landscape conformed to the aesthetic principles of the picturesque, as propounded by the British theorist William Gilpin, which began with a careful observation of nature that was then enhanced by particular notions about composition and harmony. The juxtaposition of smooth and irregular forms was an important principle, and is represented in The Heart of the Andes by the rounded hills and pool of water on the one hand, and by the contrasting jagged mountains and rough trees on the other.\r The theory of British critic John Ruskin was also an important influence on Church. Ruskin's Modern Painters was a five-volume treatise on art that was, according to American artist Worthington Whittredge, \"in every landscape painter's hand\" by mid-century. Ruskin emphasized the scrutiny of nature, and he viewed art, morality, and the natural world as spiritually unified. Following this theme, the painting displays the landscape in detail at all scales, from the intricate foliage, birds, and butterflies in the foreground to the all-encompassing portrayal of the natural environments studied by Church. The presence of the cross suggests the peaceful coexistence of religion with the landscape.\n", "\nArtist: Frederic Edwin Church\nArtwork Name: Niagara Falls, from the American Side\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frederic-edwin-church/niagara-falls-from-the-american-side-1867\n\nWikipedia Article:\nNiagara Falls, from the American Side is a painting by the American artist Frederic Edwin Church (1826\u20131900). Completed in 1867, and based on preliminary sketches made by the artist at Niagara Falls and on a sepia photograph, it is the third of a series of paintings Church made of this famous landmark. The painting is now in the collection of the Scottish National Gallery. Church was a leading member of the Hudson River School of painters.\r The painting depicts the view from the east side of Niagara Falls\u00a0\u2013 the American side. In the spray of the waterfall a rainbow is visible. The painting has been described as giving the impression of the water being in constant motion, rushing down, roaring.\r Church made his first painting of the falls in 1857. He had visited the falls several times in July and late August the previous year, making a number of pencil and oil sketches from different points of view. He elected to paint the scene from the Canadian side, choosing unconventional dimensions for the painting that emphasized the panoramic effect.\r The painting was an immediate success, attracting over 100,000 visitors within the first fortnight of its premiere at a New York gallery. Following this, it was exhibited at major cities on the Eastern seaboard, toured Britain twice and was selected for the 1867 Exposition Universelle in Paris. It was purchased by the recently founded Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1876, cementing that institution's success. When the Corcoran closed in 2014, its collection was gifted to the National Gallery of Art, Washington, where the painting can be seen today in the Corcoran gallery.\r The painting Niagara Falls, from the American Side was commissioned from Church by the American art dealer Michael Knoedler in 1866. It was the third painting of the series and may have been originally destined for the Exposition. The painting was purchased by John S. Kennedy in 1887, who gifted it to his homeland of Scotland. Niagara Falls, from the American Side is the only major work by Frederic Edwin Church which is in a public collection in Europe.\r The canvas is painted in the Romantic style and captures the aesthetic principles of the sublime and the picturesque. Church was a member of the Hudson River School, a group of landscape artists, whose aesthetic vision was influenced by romanticism. The Romantic movement validated intense emotions. The movement was placing new emphasis on the sentiments of visionary and transcendental experience. Emotions like awe\u00a0\u2013 especially that which is experienced in confronting the sublimity of untamed nature and its picturesque qualities\u00a0\u2013 were now entirely new aesthetic categories, and very different from art styles of the same era\u00a0\u2013 the unemotional Realism and of the calm, balanced Classicism\u00a0\u2013 as a source of aesthetic experience.\r The Sublime view of nature was as something of a large scale dramatic subject, an expression of the sublime\u00a0\u2013 defined by Edmund Burke as the strongest emotion that can be felt.\n", "\nArtist: Frederic Edwin Church\nArtwork Name: Parthenon\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frederic-edwin-church/parthenon-1869\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Parthenon is an 1871 painting by American artist Frederic Edwin Church.

It depicts a catboat called the Gloucester chopping through that city's harbor under \"a fair wind\" (Homer's original title). Inside the boat are a man, three boys, and their catch.\r Homer began the canvas in New York in 1873, after he had visited Gloucester, Massachusetts, where he first worked in watercolor. He used the sketches made there, of which the most closely related is Sailing the Catboat (1873), for the oil painting, which he worked on over three years. Infrared reflectography has revealed the many changes he made to the composition during this time, including the removal of a fourth boy near the mast and a second schooner in the distance. At one point the adult held both the sheet and the tiller, a position initially adapted from an oil study of 1874 titled The Flirt. The painting's message is positive; despite the choppy waves, the boaters look relaxed. The anchor that replaced the boy in the bow was understood to symbolize hope. The boy holding the tiller looks forward to the horizon, a statement of optimism about his future and that of the young United States.\r The finished work indicates that the significant influence of Japanese art on Western painters in the 19th century also touched Homer, particularly in the compositional balance between the left (active) and right (sparse) halves. Homer had visited France in 1866 and 1867, and the influence of marine scenes by the French painters Gustave Courbet and Claude Monet is apparent as well. Not all of Homer's sea pictures are so benevolent as Breezing Up: he portrayed waves crashing ashore as did Courbet (see for example The Wave, c. 1869). Monet's relatively early paintings Seascape: Storm (1867) and The Green Wave (1866) show boats on somewhat turbulent seas.\r Completed in the centennial year 1876, the painting was first exhibited at the National Academy of Design that year, then at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. By 1879, it had come to be known as Breezing Up, a title that was not the artist's but one which he did not seem to object to. A contemporary critic described the painting: \"It is painted in [Homer's] customary coarse and neglig\u00e9 style, but suggests with unmistakable force the life and motion of a breezy summer day off the coast. The fishing boat, bending to the wind, seems actually to cleave the waves. There is no truer or heartier work in the exhibition.\" Another wrote, \"Much has already been said in praise of the easy, elastic motion of the figures of the party in the sailboat, which is scudding along through blue water under 'a fair wind.' They sway with the rolling boat, and relax or grow rigid as the light keel rises or sinks upon the waves. Every person who has been similarly situated can recall how, involuntarily, his back stiffened or his knees bent as he felt the roll of the waves beneath him.\"\r Today, Breezing Up is considered an iconic American painting, and among Homer's finest. The National Gallery of Art purchased the work in 1943, described by the institution's web site as \"one of the best-known and most beloved artistic images of life in nineteenth-century America.\"\n", "\nArtist: Winslow Homer\nArtwork Name: Dressing for the Carnival\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/winslow-homer/the-carnival\n\nWikipedia Article:\nDressing for the Carnival is an 1877 painting by the American painter, printmaker and illustrator Winslow Homer.\r Homer painted African Americans, completely avoiding the stereotypes with which their collective image had been flooded during the period of Reconstruction after the Civil War. The 1870s and 1880s produced innumerable images of African Americans at carnival time, mindless, jolly, condescending. But Homer's Dressing for the Carnival is unlike all of them: a deeply nuanced and, in the end, tragic scene of preparation for festivity. A group of people is preparing for the African-American festival known in the South as Jonkonnu and in the North as Pinkster. It entailed the costuming of a Harlequin-like figure or Lord of Misrule, and this Homer depicts: a man caparisoned in bright, tatterdemalion clothes, yellow, red, and blue, with a liberty cap on his head. Two women are sewing them on him. The one on the right extends her arm, pulling the long thread right through, in a gesture of compelling and somber gravity; she is a classical Fate, seen below the Mason-Dixon line. Next to her, but apart from her, gazing at the vesting ceremony with wonder, are some children, one of whom holds a Stars and Stripes (for by Reconstruction, the rituals of the Fourth of July had been overlaid on those of Jonkonnu). Homer makes us sense how far the hopes of emancipation still are from the realities of black life in the South.\n", "\nArtist: Winslow Homer\nArtwork Name: The Fog Warning\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/winslow-homer/nebelwarnung-the-fog-warning\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Fog Warning is one of several paintings on marine subjects by the late-19th-century American painter Winslow Homer (1836\u20131910). Together with The Herring Net and Breezing Up, painted the same year and also depicting the hard lives of fishermen in Maine, it is considered among his best works on such topics.\r After initially making his reputation with paintings on themes related to the Civil War, in the late 1860s and through the 1870s Winslow Homer turned instead to painting people relaxing and at play: children, young women, genre paintings of farm and sea scenes. In 1881\u201382 he spent time in Cullercoats, in northeast England, and on his return to the US, settled for good in Prout's Neck, Maine, where his father and brother had recently purchased a large amount of land. His brother had spent his honeymoon in Prout's Neck in 1875, and Winslow had visited him then. In both these locations he returned to painting the sea with more serious themes, the hard and dangerous lives of the fishermen and their families, and \"humankind\u2019s life-and-death struggles against the sea and the elemental power of nature\" throughout the rest of his career.\r He had a studio built for him in Prout's Neck, which was completed in 1884. Here he painted The Fog Warning, one of his three best paintings he completed there in 1885 depicting the lives of the local fishermen. These are considered among his best; the others are Lost on the Grand Banks, and The Herring Net. Many of his late paintings, like The Fog Warning, depict a single figure at sea. Another theme in many of his paintings of the fisherman's life was the bounty of the sea, which also provides the people's livelihood; the two are combined in this painting, which was originally exhibited under the title Halibut Fishing.\r The painting depicts a lone fisherman in a dory who has caught several halibut but now sees fog blowing up, threatening to cut him off as he rows back to his ship. His face is turned in profile to the viewer as he looks over his shoulder at the streamers of fog in the background. The Boston Fine Art Museum gives this description:\r The scene is psychologically tense; the risk of being lost at sea as a result of a sudden fog was all too real at the time, and the viewer does not know whether this man will reach his ship in time. The picture has been used in elementary-school education to teach about interpretation of art and fishermen's lives.\r Several studies for the painting survive, among them a more intimate, less monumental version called Halibut Fishing. Homer's handyman Henry Lee posed for the painting in a dory supported on a pile of sand.\r In addition to Herring Nets and Breezing Up, which share the focus on Maine fishermen, Homer's Lost on the Grand Banks (also 1885) and After the Hurricane, Bahamas 1899 depict tragedy at sea: the former another fisherman in mortal danger at sea, the latter one thrown up on shore dead. In contrast, in Summer Night (1890) the sea is raging in the background while in the middle ground people silhouetted against the waves watch, but in the foreground two girls are dancing, unconcerned.\n", "\nArtist: Winslow Homer\nArtwork Name: Eight Bells\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/winslow-homer/eight-bells\n\nWikipedia Article:\nEight Bells may refer to:\n", "\nArtist: Winslow Homer\nArtwork Name: Fox Hunt\nArtwork Genre: wildlife painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/winslow-homer/fox-hunt\n\nWikipedia Article:\nFox hunting is an activity involving the tracking, chase and, if caught, the killing of a fox.\r Fox hunt may refer to:\r The Fox Hunt may refer to:\r Fox hunting may refer to:\n", "\nArtist: Winslow Homer\nArtwork Name: The Gulf Stream\nArtwork Genre: marina\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/winslow-homer/the-gulf-stream\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Gulf Stream is an 1899 oil painting by Winslow Homer. It shows a black man in a small dismasted rudderless fishing boat struggling against the waves of the sea, and was the artist's last statement on a theme that had interested him for more than a decade. Homer vacationed often in Florida, Cuba, and the Caribbean.\r Homer crossed the Gulf Stream numerous times; his first trip to the Caribbean in 1885 seems to have inspired several related works dated from the same year, including a pencil drawing of a dismasted boat, a large watercolor The Derelict (Sharks), and a larger watercolor of the forward part of the boat, Study for \"The Gulfstream\". A later watercolor study was The Gulfstream of 1889, in which the disabled boat now includes a black sailor and flailing shark. Additionally, there are other related watercolors; the shark in Shark Fishing of 1885 was later appropriated for The Gulfstream of 1889, and a watercolor of 1899 entitled After the Hurricane, in which a figure lies unconscious beside his beached boat, represents the finale of the watercolor narrative of man against nature.\r Another possible inspiration for the series of watercolors and The Gulf Stream itself was McCabe's Curse, a Bahamian tale about a British Captain McCabe who in 1814 was robbed by thieves, hired a small boat in hopes of reaching a nearby island, but was caught in a storm and later died in Nassau of yellow fever; Homer saved an account of the story and pasted it into a travel guide.\r A visit to Nassau and Florida between December 1898 and February 1899 immediately preceded the final painting. Homer began work on the painting by September 1899, at which time he wrote: \"I painted in water colors three months last winter at Nassau, & have now just commenced arranging a picture from some of the studies.\" Chronologically the first of a series of major works painted by Homer in the last decade of his life, The Gulf Stream was painted in the penultimate year of the century, the year after the death of his father, and has been seen as revealing his sense of abandonment or vulnerability.\r In 1900 Homer sent The Gulf Stream to Philadelphia to be exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and after it was returned later that year he wrote \"I have painted on the picture since it was in Philadelphia & improved it very much (more of the Deep Sea water than before).\" In fact, comparison with an early photograph of the painting shows that Homer not only reworked the ocean, but changed the starboard gunwale by breaking it, added the sail and the red dash of color near the waterline, made the boat's name (Anna \u2013 Key West) clearly legible, and painted in the ship at the upper left horizon\u2014possibly to mitigate the sense of desolation in the work. He then showed the painting at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, and asked $4,000 for it.\r In 1906 The Gulf Stream was exhibited at the National Academy of Design, and all the members of the academy's jury petitioned the Metropolitan Museum of Art to purchase the painting. Newspaper reviews of the work were mixed; it was seen as more melodramatic than Homer's usual work. A reviewer in Philadelphia noted that viewers had laughed at the painting, which he referred to as \"Smiling Sharks\", describing the scene as \"a naked negro lying in a boat while a school of sharks [are] waltzing around him in the most ludicrous manner\". Another contemporary critic wrote that The Gulf Stream \"displays a certain diffusion of interest seldom seen in the canvases of [Homer's] best manner\". The museum bought the painting the same year.\n", "\nArtist: Georgia O'Keeffe\nArtwork Name: Blue and Green Music\nArtwork Genre: abstract\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/georgia-o-keeffe/blue-and-green-music\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBlue and Green Music is a 1919 - 1921 painting by the American painter Georgia O'Keeffe.\r Painted in her New York years upon the idea that music could be translated into something for the eye, Blue and Green Music is a work of rhythm, movement, color, depth, and form.

The works were inspired by United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1941 State of the Union Address, known as Four Freedoms.  The painting was created in November 1942 and published in the March 6, 1943 issue of The Saturday Evening Post. All of the people in the picture were friends and family of Rockwell in Arlington, Vermont, who were photographed individually and painted into the scene. The work depicts a group of people gathered around a dinner table for a holiday meal. Having been partially created on Thanksgiving Day to depict the celebration, it has become an iconic representation for Americans of the Thanksgiving holiday and family holiday gatherings in general. The Post published Freedom from Want with a corresponding essay by Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Despite many who endured sociopolitical hardships abroad, Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring the socioeconomic hardships domestically, and it thrust him into prominence.  The painting has had a wide array of adaptations, parodies, and other uses, such as for the cover for the 1946 book Norman Rockwell, Illustrator.  Although the image was popular at the time in the United States and remains so, it caused resentment in Europe where the masses were enduring wartime hardship. Artistically, the work is highly regarded as an example of mastery of the challenges of white-on-white painting and as one of Rockwell's most famous works.  Freedom from Want is the third in a series of four oil paintings entitled Four Freedoms by Norman Rockwell. They were inspired by Franklin D. Roosevelt's State of the Union Address, known as Four Freedoms, delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941. In the early 1940s, Roosevelt's Four Freedoms themes were still vague and abstract to many, but the government used them to help boost patriotism. The Four Freedoms' theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings ran in The Saturday Evening Post accompanied by essays from noted writers on four consecutive weeks: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6), and Freedom from Fear (March 13). Eventually, the series was widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government War Bond Drive.  The illustration is an oil painting on canvas, measuring 45.75 by 35.5 inches (116.2\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a090.2\u00a0cm). The Norman Rockwell Museum describes it as a story illustration for The Saturday Evening Post, complementary to the theme, but the image is also an autonomous visual expression.  The painting shows an aproned matriarch presenting a roasted turkey to a family of several generations, in Rockwell's idealistic presentation of family values. The patriarch looks on with fondness and approval from the head of the table, which is the central element of the painting. Its creased tablecloth shows that this is a special occasion for \"sharing what we have with those we love\", according to Lennie Bennett. The table has a bowl of fruit, celery, pickles, and what appears to be cranberry sauce. There is a covered silver serving dish that would traditionally hold potatoes, according to Richard Halpern, but Bennett describes this as a covered casserole dish. The servings are less prominent than the presentation of white linen, white plates and water-filled glasses. The people in the painting are not yet eating, and the painting contrasts the empty plates and vacant space in their midst with images of overabundance.\n", "\nArtist: Norman Rockwell\nArtwork Name: Freedom From Fear\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/norman-rockwell/freedom-from-fear-1943\n\nWikipedia Article:\nFreedom from Fear is the last of the well-known Four Freedoms oil paintings produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell. The series was based on the four goals known as the Four Freedoms, which were enunciated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in his State of the Union Address on January 6, 1941. This work was published in the March 13, 1943, issue of The Saturday Evening Post alongside an essay by a prominent thinker of the day, Stephen Vincent Ben\u00e9t. The painting is generally described as depicting American children being tucked into bed by their parents while the Blitz rages across the Atlantic in Great Britain.\r Freedom from Fear is the last of a series of four oil paintings entitled Four Freedoms, painted by Norman Rockwell. The works were inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a State of the Union Address delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941; the speech itself is often called the Four Freedoms. The Four Freedoms theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings was printed in The Saturday Evening Post, accompanied by essays from noted writers, on four consecutive weeks in early 1943: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6) and Freedom from Fear (March 13). Eventually, the series was widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government's Second War Bond Drive.\r The Blitz was a period of sustained strategic bombing of the United Kingdom by Germany during the Second World War. Between 7 September 1940 and 21 May 1941, sixteen British cities were hit by major aerial raids. Beginning on 7 September 1940, London was bombed by the Luftwaffe for 57 consecutive nights. Overall, more than one million London houses were destroyed or damaged during the Blitz, and more than 40,000\u00a0 civilians were killed, almost half of them in London.\r The painting shows children resting safely in their beds, oblivious to the perils of this world, as their parents look on. Their mother tucks them in while their father holds a newspaper describing the horrors of the ongoing conflict. However, his attention is fully on his children and not on the alarming headlines. According to another view, the children are already asleep, and their parents are checking on them in their shared narrow bed before they themselves turn in for the night. The father appears as the \"classic Rockwell onlooker\" who serves as a viewer within the painting. Since he is holding his glasses, we assume that he has finished reading the Bennington Banner in his hand. The newspaper's headline reads \"Bombings Ki\u00a0... Horror Hit\", referencing the Blitz. In the background is a lit hallway and a stairway leading to the first floor.\r According to Rockwell, who did not really care much for the work, the theme \"was based on a rather smug idea. Painted during the bombing of London, it was supposed to say, 'Thank God we can put our children to bed with a feeling of security, knowing they will not be killed in the night.'\"\n", "\nArtist: Norman Rockwell\nArtwork Name: Freedom of Speech\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/norman-rockwell/freedom-of-speech-1943\n\nWikipedia Article:\nFreedom of Speech is the first of the Four Freedoms paintings by Norman Rockwell that were inspired by United States President Franklin D.

Rockwell felt that this and Freedom to Worship were the most successful of the set. Since Rockwell liked to depict life as he experienced it or envisioned it, it is not surprising that this image depicts an actual occurrence.\r Freedom of Speech was the first of a series of four oil paintings, entitled Four Freedoms, painted by Norman Rockwell. The works were inspired by United States President, Franklin D. Roosevelt in a State of the Union Address, known as Four Freedoms, delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941.

Eventually, the series became widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U. S. Government War Bond Drive.\r Freedom of Speech depicts a scene of a local town meeting in which Jim Edgerton, the lone dissenter to the town selectmen's announced plans to build a new school, was accorded the floor as a matter of protocol. The old school had burned down. Once he envisioned this scene to depict freedom of speech, Rockwell decided to use his Vermont neighbors as models for a Four Freedoms series. The blue-collar speaker wears a plaid shirt and suede jacket. He has dirty hands and a darker complexion than others in attendance. The other attendees are wearing white shirts, ties and jackets. Although one of the men is wearing a wedding band, the speaker is not. Edgerton's youth and workmanlike hands are fashioned with a worn and stained jacket, while the other attendees, appear to be older and more neatly and formally dressed. He is shown \"standing tall, his mouth open, his shining eyes transfixed, he speaks his mind, untrammeled and unafraid.\" Edgerton is depicted in a way that resembles Abraham Lincoln. According to Bruce Cole of The Wall Street Journal, the closest figure in the painting is revealing a subject of the meeting as \"a discussion of the town's annual report\". According to John Updike, the work is painted without any painterly brushwork. According to Robert Scholes, the work shows audience members in rapt attention with a sort of admiration of this lone speaker.\r Rockwell's final work was the result of four restarts and consumed two months. According to Scholes, the subject resembles a Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart character in a Frank Capra film. Each version depicted the blue-collar man in casual attire standing up at a town meeting, but each was from a different angle. Earlier versions were troubled by the distraction of multiple subjects and the improper placement and perspective of the subject for the message to be clear. An Arlington, Vermont Rockwell neighbor, Carl Hess, stood as the model for the shy, brave young workman, and another neighbor, Jim Martin, who appeared in each painting in the series, is in the scene. Rockwell's assistant, Gene Pelham, suggested Hess, who had a gas station in town and whose children went to school with the Rockwell children. According to Pelham, Hess \"had a noble head\". Others in the work were Hess' father Henry (left ear only), Jim Martin (lower right corner), Harry Brown (right \u2014 top of head and eye only), Robert Benedict, Sr. and Rose Hoyt to the left. Rockwell's own eye is also visible along the left edge. Hess was married at the time and Henry Hess was a German immigrant. Pelham was the owner of the suede jacket. Hess posed for Rockwell eight different times for this work and all other models posed for Rockwell individually.\n", "\nArtist: Norman Rockwell\nArtwork Name: Freedom to Worship\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/norman-rockwell/freedom-to-worship-1943\n\nWikipedia Article:\nFreedom of Worship or Freedom to Worship is the second of the Four Freedoms oil paintings produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell.

Freedom of Worship was published on the 27th of February, 1943, issue of The Saturday Evening Post alongside an essay by philosopher Will Durant.\r Freedom of Worship is the second of a series of four oil paintings by Norman Rockwell entitled Four Freedoms. The works were inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's State of the Union Address delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941, known as Four Freedoms. Of the Four Freedoms, the only two described in the United States Constitution are freedom of speech and freedom of religion.

The series of paintings ran on four consecutive weeks in The Saturday Evening Post, accompanied by essays from noted writers: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6) and Freedom from Fear (March 13). For the essay accompanying Freedom of Worship, Post editor Ben Hibbs chose Durant, who was a best-selling author at the peak of his fame. At the time, Durant was in the midst of working on his ten-volume The Story of Civilization, coauthored with his wife, Ariel Durant. Will Durant also lectured on history and philosophy. Eventually, the series of paintings became widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government War Bond Drive.\r The painting shows the profiles of eight heads in a modest space. The various figures represent people of different faiths in a moment of prayer. Particularly, three figures on the bottom row (right to left): a man with his head covered carrying a religious book who is Jewish, an older woman who is Protestant, and a younger woman with a well-lit face holding rosary beads who is Catholic. In 1966, Rockwell used Freedom of Worship to show his admiration for John F. Kennedy in a Look story illustration entitled JFK's Bold Legacy. The work depicts Kennedy in profile in a composition similar to Freedom of Worship along with Peace Corps volunteers.\r The original version of the painting was set in a barbershop with patrons of a variety of religions and races all waiting their turn in the barber's chair. His first workup was a 41-by-33-inch (104\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a084\u00a0cm) oil on canvas depicting tolerance as \"the basis for a democracy's religious diversity\". It included a Jew being served by a Protestant barber as a black man and a Roman Catholic priest awaited the barber's services. The problem was painting easily recognizable depictions of different religions and races because there was little agreement on what a person of a certain religion should look like. However, as he attempted to clarify the characters' depictions he found himself resorting to offensive overexaggeration, especially of the non-clerical characters. Making a Jewish man appear stereotypically Semitic, making a white customer preppy and relegating the black man to agrarian workman attire bogged down the work without speaking on behalf of the government as it should. Rockwell's intended theme was religious tolerance, but he felt the original composition did not successfully make this point.\n", "\nArtist: Barnett Newman\nArtwork Name: Voice of Fire\nArtwork Genre: abstract\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/barnett-newman/voice-of-fire-1967\n\nWikipedia Article:\nVoice of Fire is an acrylic on canvas abstract painting made by American painter Barnett Newman in 1967. It consists of three equally sized vertical stripes, with the outer two painted blue and the centre painted red. The work was created as a special commission for Expo 67. In 1987 it was loaned to the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\r The purchase of Voice of Fire by the National Gallery of Canada for its permanent collection in 1989 at a cost of $1.8 million caused a storm of controversy. Some residents mocked the purchase with striped T-shirts and ties that mimicked the painting. The 1996 book Voices of Fire: Art Rage, Power, and the State, edited by Bruce Barber, Serge Guilbaut and John O'Brian, discusses the issues around the purchase of the painting.\r Commissioned for Expo 67, the International and Universal Exposition that took place in Montreal during Canada's 1967 centennial, Voice of Fire was part of the US pavilion organized by art critic and historian Alan Solomon. The exhibition, American Painting Now featured the work of twenty-two artists installed in the US Pavilion, a geodesic dome designed by engineer Buckminster Fuller. Explicitly oriented to Solomon's directions, Voice of Fire's 18 foot length was vertical to echo the size of the dome. This was the first time Newman worked on this scale in a vertical format. The paintings were displayed along other symbols of American progress, an Apollo space capsule and red-and-white striped Apollo parachutes, photographs of the moon and large-scale photographs of movie stars.\r In the spring of 1987, Brydon Smith, then assistant director of the National Gallery of Canada contacted Newman's widow Annalee to ask if she would consider lending it to the gallery for a temporary exhibition the following year to coincide with the completion of a new building.\r In May 1988 Voice of Fire was installed in the newly constructed National Gallery of Canada with little media attention or controversy. It was displayed in a large, high-ceiling space, with only a few other works by American artists Milton Resnick, Jackson Pollock and Tony Smith. In this display of post-war US art, Voice of Fire \"was given pride of place\" as the centrepiece. In March 1990, the National Gallery announced its purchase of the painting for $1.8 million, which ignited a \"firestorm\" of media attention and controversy in Ottawa mostly centered around the question of if the work was worthy of being called art. Recently it was reported that senior personnel at the National Gallery estimated that the current value of the painting is in excess of $40 million. A further controversy ensued in 1992 when it was discovered that the painting had been displayed upside-down following its acquisition. The work remains in the possession of the National Gallery of Canada.\n", "\nArtist: Roy Lichtenstein\nArtwork Name: Brattata\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/brattata-1962\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  Brattata is a 1962 pop art painting by Roy Lichtenstein in his comic book style of using Ben-Day dots and a text balloon. The work is held in the collection at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art. It is one of several Lichtenstein works from All-American Men of War issue #89, but is a reworking of its source panel.  According to the University of Michigan Library, at one time the work was held in the Fischmann collection. St. Louis businessman and financeer, Milton Fischmann died in May 1974, and the work is now in the collection of the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art. A trained draftsman and artist, Lichtenstein was a United States Army pilot who served in World War II without ever seeing active combat. His list of aeronautical themed works is extensive. Within that genre, Lichtenstein has featured pilots situated in cockpits during air combat in many of his works, such as Jet Pilot (1962), Brattata (1962), Bratatat! (1963), and Okay Hot-Shot, Okay! (1963). The source of Brattata is All-American Men of War #89 (January\u2013February 1962, DC Comics).  The same issue was the inspiration for several other Lichtenstein paintings, Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Blam, Whaam! and Tex! The graphite pencil sketch, Jet Pilot was also from that issue. The pilot's mask is unbuckled, revealing the lower half of his face (as opposed to Bratatat! and Jet Pilot where only the eyes are visible). The onomatopoeia presented graphically appears as a clich\u00e9. In comparison to the original Lichtenstein increased the required number of downed planes for flying ace recognition by two, possibly reflecting his own training.  The work is among those known for \"bursting shapes and colors\" in its graphical content and excellent sound and action in its narrative content.  It is one of several Lichtenstein works that depicts what one author describes as a \"male violence fantasy\".  Original artwork artist Russ Heath had accurately depicted the downward slanting gun sight and angled cockpit control panel.  Lichtenstein depicted these without any slant, making them parallel to the surface of the canvas, which in a sense makes the viewer feel as if he is taking the place of the pilot.\n", "\nArtist: Roy Lichtenstein\nArtwork Name: Happy Tears\nArtwork Genre: figurative\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/happy-tears-1964\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  Happy Tears is a 1964 pop art painting by Roy Lichtenstein.

On November 13, 2002, Happy Tears surpassed Kiss II, which had sold for $6.0 million in May 1990, by selling for $7.1 million at Christie's auction house in New York. In November 2005, the 1963 work In the Car surpassed Happy Tears'  Lichtenstein work record auction price, when it sold for $16.2 million.  Happy Tears was acquired at the Leo Castelli Gallery, New York, in 1964. It did not change hands until it was sold again on November 13, 2002, at auction at Christie's in New York. The owner lent this work for exhibition twice in the late 1960s. From November 1967 to May 1968, the exhibit made stops at the Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam), Tate Gallery (London), Kunsthalle Bern (Bern), and Kestner-Gesellschaft (Hannover). From September to November 1969, it was exhibited at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. It was then displayed at the Gagosian Gallery in New York City in 2008.  When the American independent comedy-drama film entitled Happy Tears, starring Parker Posey, Demi Moore, Rip Torn, Sebastian Roch\u00e9, and Ellen Barkin, which was written and directed by Roy Lichtenstein's son, Mitchell Lichtenstein, was marketed, the film poster prominently included the image of his father's work. The film was named after this painting.  After 1963, Lichtenstein's comics-based women \"look hard, crisp, brittle, and uniformly modish in appearance, as if they all came out of the same pot of makeup.\"  This particular example is one of several that is cropped so closely that the hair flows beyond the edges of the canvas. The image is made more poignant by the cropping and positioning of the fingers.

It is owned by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which purchased it in 1948.  The painting depicts an office occupied by an attractive young woman in a short-sleeved blue dress who is standing at an open file cabinet, and a slightly older man who is perhaps in early middle age. He is dressed in a three-piece suit and is seated behind a desk. The nature of the office is unclear\u2014it could just as easily be the office of a lawyer, an accountant or of a small business.  Several clues provide context. The high angle from which the viewer looks down on the office implies that the viewer may be looking in from a passing elevated train. Indeed, Hopper later informed Norman A. Geske, the curator of the Walker Art Center which acquired the painting in 1948, that the idea for the painting was \"probably first suggested by many rides on the 'L' train in New York City after dark glimpses of office interiors that were so fleeting as to leave fresh and vivid impressions on my mind.\" So this is not a prestige office\u2014a fact that is reinforced by the awkward lozenge shape of the room and by the small size of the man\u2019s desk. A yet smaller desk, holding a typewriter, may belong to the woman. This implies that she may be his secretary.   Still, this is a corner office which indicates that within their small organization this is the most prestigious available space and therefore that the man is, perhaps, the manager or boss.   As in many of his other paintings, Hopper shows movement by means of a wind-blown curtain. In this painting, the ring at the bottom of the drawstring on the blind is swinging outward after the blind has been blown in by a gust of wind\u2014possibly in response to a cross-breeze caused by the passing train.   The gust explains two other things. First, there is a sheet of paper on the floor beside the desk which must have just blown there from the desk as it has caught the woman\u2019s eye. Second, the wind has blown the dress tightly around her legs, revealing her voluptuous figure to the strangers on the train\u2014but not to the man who stares intently at another document.  There is a sexual interpretation of the relationship between the two individuals. Here, as in a number of Hopper\u2019s works, such as Evening Wind (1921) and Summertime (1943), the stirring of curtains or blinds seems to symbolize emotional or physical stirrings. By contrast, listless curtains in other Hopper paintings like Eleven A.M. (1926) and Hotel by a Railroad (1952) seem to imply emotional stagnation or an inability to connect.  One critic writes, \"Although the room is brightly lit, we sense that something strange is going on. Apart from the relationship between the two figures, the suspenseful mood arises from the circumstance that they are apparently poring over confidential material at this late hour, looking for a certain document that has yet to turn up.\" The man's intense concentration suggests that the matter is critical to him\u2014he has not bothered to take off his jacket despite the fact that it is warm enough for all the windows to be open, and he seems not to have noticed the wind which has caused a document to fall to the floor. \n", "\nArtist: Edward Hopper\nArtwork Name: Nighthawks\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-hopper/nighthawks\n\nWikipedia Article:\nNighthawks is a 1942 oil on canvas painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people in a downtown diner late at night.\r It has been described as Hopper's best known work and one of the most recognizable paintings in American art. Within months of its completion, it was sold to the Art Institute of Chicago on May 13, 1942 for $3,000.\r Starting shortly after their marriage in 1924, Edward Hopper and his wife Josephine (Jo) kept a journal in which he would, using a pencil, make a sketch-drawing of each of his paintings, along with a precise description of certain technical details. Jo Hopper would then add additional information about the theme of the painting.\r A review of the page on which Nighthawks is entered shows (in Edward Hopper's handwriting) that the intended name of the work was actually Night Hawks and that the painting was completed on January 21, 1942.\r Jo's handwritten notes about the painting give considerably more detail, including the possibility that the painting's title may have had its origins as a reference to the beak-shaped nose of the man at the bar, or that the appearance of one of the \"nighthawks\" was tweaked in order to relate to the original meaning of the word:\r In January 1942, Jo confirmed her preference for the name. In a letter to Edward's sister Marion she wrote, \"Ed has just finished a very fine picture--a lunch counter at night with 3 figures. Night Hawks would be a fine name for it. E. posed for the two men in a mirror and I for the girl. He was about a month and half working on it.\"\r Upon completing the canvas in the late winter of 1942, Hopper placed it on display at Rehn's, the gallery at which his paintings were normally placed for sale. It remained there for about a month. On St. Patrick's Day, Edward and Jo Hopper attended the opening of an exhibit of the paintings of Henri Rousseau at the Museum of Modern Art, which had been organized by Daniel Catton Rich, the director of the Art Institute of Chicago. Rich was in attendance, along with Alfred Barr, the director of the Museum of Modern Art. Barr spoke enthusiastically of Gas, which Hopper had painted a year earlier, and \"Jo told him he just had to go to Rehn's to see Nighthawks. In the event it was Rich who went, pronounced Nighthawks 'fine as a Homer', and soon arranged its purchase for Chicago.\" The sale price was $3,000. The painting has remained in the collection of the Art Institute ever since.\r The scene was supposedly inspired by a diner (since demolished) in Greenwich Village, Hopper's neighborhood in Manhattan. Hopper himself said the painting \"was suggested by a restaurant on Greenwich Avenue where two streets meet.\" Additionally, he noted that \"I simplified the scene a great deal and made the restaurant bigger.\"\r This reference has led Hopper aficionados to engage in a search for the location of the original diner. The inspiration for this search has been summed up on the blog of one of these searchers: \"I am finding it extremely difficult to let go of the notion that the Nighthawks diner was a real diner, and not a total composite built of grocery stores, hamburger joints, and bakeries all cobbled together in the painter's imagination.\"\n", "\nArtist: Rogier van der Weyden\nArtwork Name: Virgin and Child\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden/virgin-and-child-4\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Virgin and Child Enthroned (also known as the Thyssen Madonna) is a small oil-on-oak panel painting dated c. 1433, usually attributed to the Early Netherlandish artist Rogier van der Weyden. It is closely related to his Madonna Standing, completed during the same period. The panel is filled with Christian iconography, including representations of prophets, the Annunciation, Christ's infancy and resurrection, and Mary's Coronation. It is generally accepted as the earliest extant work by van der Weyden, one of three works attributed to him of the Virgin and Child enclosed in a niche on an exterior wall of a Gothic church. The panel is housed in the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza in Madrid.\r The panel seems to be the left-hand wing of a dismantled diptych, perhaps with the Saint George and the Dragon panel now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. As an early van der Weyden, it takes influence from Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck. Van der Weyden served his apprenticeship under Campin, and the older master's style is noticeable in the architecture of the niche, the Virgin's facial type, her exposed breast and the treatment of her hair.\r The panel is the smallest extant work by van der Weyden and follows the tradition of a Madonna Lactans, with significant differences. Christ is dressed in a red garment, as opposed to the swaddling he usually wears in 15th-century Virgin and Child portrayals. This is one of two exceptions where he is fully clothed; the other is Robert Campin's Madonna in Frankfurt, where he is shown in blue clothing. Mary's unbound blond hair falls across her shoulders and down across her arms. Showing the influence of Campin, it is brushed behind the ears. She wears a crown as Queen of Heaven and a ring on a finger as the Bride of Christ. Reinforcing this, the blue colour of her robe alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son. The folds of her dress are reminiscent of the lengthy, crisp, curved intertwined gowns of Gothic sculpture.\r The pictorial space is bathed in soft light, probably an influence from Jan van Eyck. The light falls from the right, throwing shadows of both Mary and the Child's heads on the left wall of the niche. The Virgin and Child are shown seated in a small Gothic chapel or oratory projecting from a wall and opening onto a lawn. The painting pays very close attention to small realistic detail; for example, there are four small holes above each arch, likely to hold scaffolding.\r As with other early van der Weyden depictions of the Madonna, her head is slightly too large for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg. This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.\r The chapel is unrealistically small compared to the Virgin; van der Weyden's intention was to emphasise the Virgin's presence while also symbolically representing the Church and the entire doctrine of the Redemption. The panel is one of three surviving of van der Weyden's in which both Madonna and Child are enclosed in this way. However it is unusual in that the niche exists as a separate feature within the picture, compared to the two other works where the enclosure is coterminous with the edge of the painting, almost as part of the frame, a reason why it is thought to predate The Madonna Standing.\n", "\nArtist: Rogier van der Weyden\nArtwork Name: Madonna and Child\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden/madonna-and-child-4\n\nWikipedia Article:\nDur\u00e1n Madonna (also known as the Madonna in Red or Virgin and Child in a Niche or Madonna Enthroned) is an oil on oak panel painting completed sometime between 1435 and 1438 by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The painting derives from Jan van Eyck's Ince Hall Madonna and was much imitated subsequently. Now in the Prado, Madrid, it depicts a seated and serene Virgin Mary dressed in a long, flowing red robe lined with gold-coloured thread. She cradles the child Jesus who sits on her lap, playfully leafing backwards through a holy book or manuscript on which both figures' gazes rest. But unlike van Eyck's earlier treatment, van der Weyden not only positions his Virgin and Child in a Gothic apse or niche as he had his two earlier madonnas (the Madonna Standing and the Virgin and Child Enthroned), but also places them on a projecting plinth, thus further emphasising their sculptural impression.\r Christ appears much older than in most contemporary paintings of this kind. He is far from an infant, and is very realistically and physically rendered. He is shown as a small child, with none of the softness of usual 15th-century depictions of the Virgin and Child. The painting is characterised by the sculptural look that van der Weyden often favoured, and for its similarity in colourisation to his c. 1435 Descent from the Cross (Madrid) and c. 1442\u201345 Miraflores Altarpiece (Berlin).\r The painting was acquired by Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez-Dur\u00e1n in 1899 at the Palacio de Boadilla, Madrid. He donated the work to the Museo del Prado in 1930.\r Mary is shown in a long, red, hooded robe and white headdress, with the Child Jesus in a white shirt seated on her lap. He curiously leafs through and crumples the pages of a book perched on his mother's knee. The book is placed at the very center of the panel, symbolising the centrality of the divine Word in Christian belief. According to the Prado, the book itself represents an allusion to the \"Holy Scriptures that announce Christ's redemptive mission.\" An angel in dark grey dress hovers above Mary's head, holding a pearl-encrusted crown destined for her upon her assumption as Queen of Heaven. Mary's long robe swirls around the pictorial space, obscuring her throne and eventually falling at the support by her feet. They are framed by a sculpted niche or apse with Gothic tracery similar to that found in van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross. The curved arches of the niche echo the lines of her figure as she bends protectively over the child. These curved lines and warm colours give the work its sense of internal harmony.\r Art-historical analysis in the early to mid 20th century placed little emphasis on Christ's older age for a \"Virgin and Child\" work of this period. Nor did it emphasise the significance of the manuscript or the rough manner in which Christ seems to energetically leaf through it, his play watched on by a near-indulgent Mary. More recently, art historians such as Alfred Acres have questioned the significance of the child's freedom of movement and naturalistic portrayal in such a deliberately elegant and poised work\u2014especially in the work of such a self-aware and compositionally involved painter as van der Weyden. Acres believes that the book is central to the understanding of the painting, and notes its perfect centrality in the panel; it is the focus of both figures' gazes and hands, and Christ is apparently leafing backwards through the pages, towards the beginning. While Christ's right hand holds a number of parchments scrunched together and he pays no attention to them, his more careful left hand is about to open the lower left corner of the open page. If it is reasonably assumed that the book held open on Mary's lap is facing towards her, it seems the child is leafing backwards through the pages. While holy books were often included in 15th-century northern depictions of the Virgin, they were usually associated with the idea of the Virgin as a representation of learning or wisdom; in no other contemporary painting are they turned through with such restless energy, not to mention being turned through from end to beginning. Acres suggests that the infant Christ is leafing back towards Genesis: 3 describing the Fall of Man, citing three other works where van der Weyden similarly articulates the redemptive theme, including the Madonna Standing panel in the Kunsthistorisches Museum where the Madonna is flanked by figures of Adam and Eve.\n", "\nArtist: Rogier van der Weyden\nArtwork Name: Madonna and Child\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden/madonna-and-child-6\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna Standing (or Madonna al latte) is a small painting by the Flemish artist Rogier van der Weyden dating from about 1430\u20131432. It is the left panel of a diptych held in the Kunsthistorisches Museum (KHM), Vienna since 1772. The right panel portrays St. Catherine and is also attributed by the KHM to van der Weyden, but is inferior in quality and generally regarded as by a workshop member.\r The panel shows the Madonna and Child standing in a painted niche. The architecture of the niche's contains biblical and heavenly figures rendered in grisaille, including God the Father, the Holy Spirit represented by a dove, and Adam and Eve. The painting is influenced by Jan van Eyck's Ghent altarpiece, which the younger artist probably saw after he moved to Ghent around 1432. Borrowings from van Eyck include the positioning of a living figure in a niche, separating Adam and Eve across panels, and placing figure of God leaning on the frame.\r The painting is a Madonna Lactans. The Madonna and Child stand in a space delimited by the rich brocade of the throne at the back and the delicate curtain of tracery in the front, a flattening of the picture space into a kind of relief regarded by Panofsky as already unmistakably Rogerian. It was a technique he would further refine in his Dur\u00e1n Madonna of 1435\u20131438. In this work, Mary holds the child in her arms as he suckles at her breast. The blue colour of her robe may allude to her devotion and fidelity to her son. She is wearing a crown, positioning her as Queen of Heaven. The Child is unclothed save for a white linen cloth, foreshadowing the shroud in which his body was later placed following the Deposition.\r The niche around the central couple contains a number of biblical figures in grisaille. God the Father is shown at the centre top, just above the niche's concave moulding. He is depicted in frontal foreshortening, giving the impression that He is emerging from the clouds around Him. He seems to lean forward with one hand raised in blessing and the other resting on the frame, the latter a device likely borrowed from the depiction of the prophet Micah in the right lunette on the exterior of the Ghent altarpiece. In both depictions the father is shown directly above Mary, looking down at her and resting on the painting's frame. In the current panel, a dove hovers above Mary, symbolising the Holy Spirit.\r To Mary's left and right are the figures of Adam and Eve, referencing the Redemption. Eve stands underneath an apple tree, with a large serpent with a human head coiling its body around its trunk. She eats from the forbidden fruit, indicating that she is depicted at the moment of the fall of man. However Roger avoids providing the work with a narrative element by reversing the typical portrayal of the first couple; Adam is to the left, Eve to the right. Unusually for art to this point, they stand apart, divided on either side of the imitation pictorial frame. Again, this is likely borrowed from the Ghent altarpiece, where the couple are separated by five panels. The lions on the armrests of the chair behind Mary show that she is standing in front of a Throne of Solomon, as is also depicted in Jan Eyck's Lucca Madonna recalling the Seat of Wisdom tradition.\n", "\nArtist: Rogier van der Weyden\nArtwork Name: The Annunciation\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden/the-annunciation-1440\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Annunciation Triptych is an oil-on-panel triptych by the Netherlandish artist Rogier van der Weyden, dating from around 1434. It was originally formed by three panels, the central one being now at The Louvre museum in Paris, France; the side panels are at the Galleria Sabauda of Turin, northern Italy.\r It is an early work by the Netherlandish artist, with a visible re-elaborations of elements from Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck. The central panel depicts a composition within a domestic interior, with a richly dressed Angel surprising the Virgin who reads a book (a symbol of the Holy Books).\r Van der Weyden paid attentions to technical details, such as the shining metallic objects, like the lamp, the jar, the medallion hanging over the bed. The horizon line is elevated like in other contemporary Neterlandish paintings.\r The side panels have similar characteristics, but are set in more luminous landscapes, with the elements in the background becoming increasingly invisible in the haze, according to aerial perspective.\n", "\nArtist: Rogier van der Weyden\nArtwork Name: Mary Altarpiece\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden/mary-altarpiece-1445\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Miraflores Altarpiece (or Triptych of the Virgin, or The Altar of Our Lady or the Mary Altarpiece) is a c. 1442-5 oil-on-oak wood panel altarpiece by the Early Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden, in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin since 1850. The three panels are each 71 x 43 cm and show, from left to right, a portrait of the Holy Family, a Piet\u00e0 (the Virgin cradling the dead body of Jesus) and Christ's appearance to Mary\u2014a chronological reading of the birth, death and resurrection of Jesus, with Mary the focus of both wings. The altarpiece examines Mary's relationship with Christ at different stages of his life. It is notable for its use of colour, distinguished by its use of whites, reds and blues, and use of line\u2014notably the line of Christ's body in the central panel\u2014and, typically of van der Weyden, its emotional impact.\r Typical for triptychs of the period, the altarpiece is rich in religious symbolism; each panel is framed by a rounded arch with Gothic decorations in open tracery below and in the spandrel. Each is lined with highly detailed simulated relief sculptures, with complicated iconography. The altarpiece influenced contemporary painters, especially in the use of symbolically decorated portals placed as imaginary reliefs in the framing arches. It informed works by Petrus Christus, Dirk Bouts and Hans Memling.\r Each panel is framed by an arch or doorway and seems to be positioned within church portals, in interior spaces that give the appearance of taking place on a stage. The front of each frame contains the facing of a step, which, according to art historian Jeffrey Chipps Smith, implies \"the viewer's proximity to, and potential for imaginatively entering into, the divine stage.\" In contrast to most triptychs of the time, the panels were originally fixed and not hinged, although they were later broken apart and reassembled as movable. Each is remarkably free of the pictorial traditions generally used when depicting these episodes. The Holy Family panel shows none of the other figures usually represented in pictures of the birth or infancy of Christ. Many of the elements are van der Weyden's own inventions, for example the winding path in the right panel does not refer to any previous representation or biblical text. It is a temporal device to link the resurrected Christ with the figure who appears before Mary.\r The different colours of Mary's robes in each panel bear symbolic meaning; the white, red and blues are intended to depict her three traditional virtues; respectively purity, compassion and perseverance. She is shown in pure white in the family panel to underscore her perpetual virginity, in red (a predominant colour in the triptych) as she mourns her son, and in blue as he reappears to her.\r The framing arch of each panel is historiated, containing series of small and imagined but highly detailed and symbolic, protruding or raised, marble statues which augment the narrative of the particular episode from Christ's life. The triptych is often associated with van der Weyden's other John the Baptist altarpiece as both utilise imagined stone reliefs both as framing devices and as a means to develop on the main theme of the particular panel. The arches are painted in browns, likely to give the appearance of timber. They are fantastic rather than realistic, serving as a device to include the small relief figures located in the archivolts which reflect on and accentuate the narrative and theme of the panel on which they appear.\n", "\nArtist: Rogier van der Weyden\nArtwork Name: The Magdalene Reading\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden/the-magdalene-reading-1445\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Magdalen Reading is one of three surviving fragments of a large mid-15th-century oil-on-panel altarpiece by the Early Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The panel, originally oak, was completed some time between 1435 and 1438 and has been in the National Gallery, London since 1860. It shows a woman with the pale skin, high cheek bones and oval eyelids typical of the idealised portraits of noble women of the period. She is identifiable as the Magdalen from the jar of ointment placed in the foreground, which is her traditional attribute in Christian art. She is presented as completely absorbed in her reading, a model of the contemplative life, repentant and absolved of past sins. In Catholic tradition the Magdalen was conflated with both Mary of Bethany who anointed the feet of Jesus with oil and the unnamed \"sinner\" of Luke 7:36\u201350. Iconography of the Magdalen commonly shows her with a book, in a moment of reflection, in tears, or with eyes averted.\r The background of the painting had been overpainted with a thick layer of brown paint. A cleaning between 1955 and 1956 revealed the figure standing behind the Magdalene and the kneeling figure with its bare foot protruding in front of her, with a landscape visible through a window. The two partially seen figures are both cut off at the edges of the London panel. The figure above her has been identified as belonging to a fragment in the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon, which shows the head of Saint Joseph, while another Lisbon fragment, showing what is believed to be Saint Catherine of Alexandria, is thought to be from the same larger work. The original altarpiece was a sacra conversazione, known only through a drawing, Virgin and Child with Saints, in Stockholm's Nationalmuseum, which followed a partial copy of the painting that probably dated from the late 16th century. The drawing shows that The Magdalen occupied the lower right-hand corner of the altarpiece. The Lisbon fragments are each a third of the size of The Magdalen, which measures 62.2\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a054.4\u00a0cm (24.5\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a021.4\u00a0in).\r Although internationally successful in his lifetime, van der Weyden fell from view during the 17th century, and was not rediscovered until the early 19th century. The Magdalen Reading can first be traced to an 1811 sale. After passing through the hands of a number of dealers in the Netherlands, the panel was purchased by the National Gallery, London, in 1860 from a collector in Paris. It is described by art historian Lorne Campbell as \"one of the great masterpieces of 15th-century art and among van der Weyden's most important early works.\"\r Mary Magdalene as depicted in early Renaissance painting is a composite of various biblical figures. Here, she is based on Mary of Bethany, who is identified as the Magdalene in the Roman Catholic tradition. Mary of Bethany sat at Jesus' feet and \"listened to His Word\", and thus is seen as a contemplative figure. The counterpoint is Mary's sister Martha who, representative of the active life, wished that Mary would help her serve. Mary is shown by van der Weyden as youthful, sitting in quiet piety with her head tilted and eyes modestly averted from the viewer. She is absorbed in her reading of a holy book, the covers of which include a chemise of white cloth, a common form of protective binding. Four coloured cloth bookmarks are tied to a gold bar near the top of the spine. According to Lorne Campbell, the manuscript \"looks rather like a 13th-century French Bible\" and is \"clearly a devotional text\". It was rare for contemporary portraits to show women reading, and if the model herself could read then she was likely from a noble family.\n", "\nArtist: Rogier van der Weyden\nArtwork Name: Pierre Bladelin Triptych\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden/pierre-bladelin-triptych-1450\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Bladelin Altarpiece, or Middelburg Altarpiece, is a triptych painting created around 1450 by the Flemish painter Rogier van der Weyden, towards the end of his artistic career. The work depicts scenes relating to the birth of Jesus; it is the only nativity scene definitively attributed to van der Wayden, and so is also known as the Nativity Triptych (although the Saint Columba Altarpiece shows the Adoration of the Magi). It was donated to the new church of the town of Middelburg in 1460, possibly by Pieter Bladelin, who founded the town. It has been in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin, since 1834.\r The large central panel depicts the birth of Jesus, with Virgin and Child in the stable at Bethlehem, accompanied by beasts and angels. The composition draws much from the 1420 Nativity of van der Weyden's master, Robert Campin, in Dijon. The stable is a half-ruined thatched Romanesque building, rather than the traditional wooden hut, with stone walls and arched windows, and one prominent classical pillar, uniquely in van der Weyden's work shown in an oblique perspective view. Three adult figures are kneeling, worshiping the Christ Child. Mary is wearing a light blue gown, with a deep blue cloak; to the left, Joseph in a red gown holds a lighted candle, balanced by a donor portrait of man in black clothes, kneeling outside the stable to the right. Below Joseph is a large metal grate, possibly covering the mouth of an underground cistern. In the background, to the left, is a tiny scene of an angel announcing the birth of Jesus to shepherds, while to the right is a city scene with a road, walls and towers.\r The two smaller side panels show related scenes. The left panel draws from the Speculum Humanae Salvationis and depicts the legendary occasion when the Roman Emperor Augustus consulted the Tiburtine Sibyl to ask if he was the greatest man on earth and if he should consent to being worshiped as a god; the Sybil revealed to him a vision of the Virgin and Child, and Augustus then reputedly founded an altar in Rome to the \"firstborn of god\" (Ara primogeniti Dei) at the location now occupied by the Ara Coeli. The emperor is kneeling next to the Sybil, looking towards the central panel to observe the vision through a window symbolically marked with the double-headed eagle of the Hapsburgs; to his right stand three attendants, possible based on courtiers of the Philip the Good; all are wearing 15th century Flemish dress. The right panel shows the arrival of the three Magi in Bethlehem, bearing gifts; they kneel facing towards the central panel to observe a vision of an infant Christ Child.\r The side panels of the altarpiece would only be opened to reveal the brightly coloured images inside for church services at the weekend and on other special occasions. Most of the time, the doors would be closed, concealing the main images within. The outside surfaces of the side panels were decorated by an unknown artist with a grisaille of the Annunciation, with the Virgin Mary to the left, with a red curtain and a vase with a symbolic lily, and the Angel Gabriel to the right with a speech scroll bearing the words \"AVE GRAZIA PLENA\" (Latin: \"Hail [Mary] full of grace\"). As a result, the triptych has four Annunciation scenes: one to Mary on the outside, and three inside: one to Augustus, one to the Magi, and one to the shepherds.\n", "\nArtist: Rogier van der Weyden\nArtwork Name: Seven Sacraments Altarpiece\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden/seven-sacraments-altarpiece-1450\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Seven Sacraments Altarpiece is a fixed-wing triptych by the Early Netherlandish artist Rogier van der Weyden and his workshop.

It retains some of its original frames.\r Six outer panels (or shutters) are hinged; when folded they show an exterior view of saints and the donors. The inner panels contain scenes from the Last Judgement arranged across two registers. The large central panel that spans both registers shows Christ seated on a rainbow in judgment, with his feet resting on a golden globe. Below him the Archangel Michael holds scales as he weighs souls. The panel on Christ's far right shows the gates of Heaven, that to his far left the entrance to Hell. The panels of the lower register form a continuous landscape, with figures depicted moving from the central panel to their final destinations after receiving judgement.\r The altarpiece was commissioned in 1443 for the Hospices de Beaune by Nicolas Rolin, Chancellor of the Duchy of Burgundy, and his wife Guigone de Salins, who is buried in front of the altarpiece's original location in the hospice. It is one of van der Weyden's most ambitious works, equal to his Prado Deposition and lost Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald. It remains in the hospice today, although not in its original position. It is in poor condition and was moved in the 20th century to shield it from sunlight and better protect it from the almost 300,000 visitors it receives annually. It has suffered from extensive paint loss, the wearing and darkening of its colours, and an accumulation of dirt. In addition, a heavy layer of over-paint was applied during restoration. The two painted sides of the outer panels have been separated so both can be shown simultaneously; traditionally, the shutters would have been opened only on selected Sundays or church holidays.\r Nicolas Rolin was appointed Chancellor of Burgundy by Philip the Good in 1422, a position he held for the next 33 years. His tenure with the duke made him a wealthy man, and he donated a large portion of his fortune for the foundation of the H\u00f4tel-Dieu in Beaune. It is not known why he decided to build in Beaune rather than in his birthplace of Autun. He may have chosen Beaune because it lacked a hospital and an outbreak of the plague decimated the population between 1438 and 1440. Furthermore, when in 1435 the Treaty of Arras failed to bring a cessation to the longstanding hostility and animosity between Burgundy and France, the town suffered brutal ravages and famine from \u00e9corcheurs (marauding bands) who roamed the countryside during the late 1430s and early 1440s. The hospice was built after Rolin gained permission from Pope Eugene IV in 1441, and it was eventually consecrated on 31 December 1452. In conjunction, Rolin established the religious order of \"Les s\u0153urs hospitali\u00e8res de Beaune\". Rolin dedicated the hospice to St Anthony Abbot, who was commonly associated with sickness and healing during the Middle Ages.\n", "\nArtist: Rogier van der Weyden\nArtwork Name: Virgin and Child\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden/virgin-and-child-1454\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Virgin and Child is a painting by the Flemish artist Rogier van der Weyden dating from after 1454 in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.\r It has not always been thought to be an original autograph work of van der Weyden. The noted art historian and specialist of the period Erwin Panofsky thought it merely an \"excellent replica\" of a design by van der Weyden, a view that seemed confirmed by the technical evidence available at the time. However more recent studies confirm it as an autograph.\r .\r The painting is probably the last of van der Weyden's half-length Madonnas, although rather smaller than the others. Half-length Madonnas had gone out of fashion in the Lowlands in the first half of the fifteenth century and it was van der Weyden who had reintroduced them.\r In other respects it is quite atypical of the period. The tenderness of the embrace, the infant child anchored against the shoulder and twisting round (an example of contrapposto), and the pensive gaze of the Infant distinguish it from all its predecessors. It seems certain that van der Weyden's Madonna is based on the Italo-Byzantine Cambrai Madonna which had been brought back from Rome by a Cambrai monk in 1440 and installed with great ceremony in 1451 in the Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce de Cambrai (the name itself derives from the image) at Cambrai some 30 miles to the south of Tournai where van der Weyden had grown up. This icon is of a kind known as an Eleusa icon (i.e.a tenderness icon) which are typified by the Infant nestling against the Virgin's cheek. A cult had grown up around it as painted by St. Luke himself, and copies were ordered from Hayne of Brussels as well as from Petrus Christus. But whereas Hayne at least had merely copied it, van der Weyden inventively transformed it. Panofsky believed he could date van der Weyden's painting after 1455 because that was the date the Altar of Saint John was commissioned by the Abbey of St. Aubert, Cambrai, delivered by him in person in 1459. However van der Weyden would have certainly have known of it otherwise, indeed had been commissioned as civic artist for Brussels to paint a Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin. Dekeyzer gives its date as circa 1460, and remarks it can be dated to the last years of van der Weyden's career on the basis of style, the broad forehead and narrow heavy-lidded eyes of the Virgin bearing a marked resemblance to the one in the Diptych of Philip de Cro\u00ff with The Virgin and Child, which can be dated to 1460 on historical grounds.\n", "\nArtist: Rogier van der Weyden\nArtwork Name: Portrait of a Lady\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden/portrait-of-a-lady-1460\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of a Lady (or Portrait of a Woman) is a small oil-on-oak panel painting executed around 1460 by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The composition is built from the geometric shapes that form the lines of the woman's veil, neckline, face, and arms, and by the fall of the light that illuminates her face and headdress. The vivid contrasts of darkness and light enhance the almost unnatural beauty and Gothic elegance of the model.\r Van der Weyden was preoccupied by commissioned portraiture towards the end of his life and was highly regarded by later generations of painters for his penetrating evocations of character. In this work, the woman's humility and reserved demeanour are conveyed through her fragile physique, lowered eyes and tightly grasped fingers. She is slender and depicted according to the Gothic ideal of elongated features, indicated by her narrow shoulders, tightly pinned hair, high forehead and the elaborate frame set by the headdress. It is the only known portrait of a woman accepted as an autograph work by van der Weyden, yet the sitter's name is not recorded and he did not title the work.\r Although van der Weyden did not adhere to the conventions of idealisation, he generally sought to flatter his sitters. He depicted his models in highly fashionable clothing, often with rounded\u2014almost sculpted\u2014facial features, some of which deviated from natural representation. He adapted his own aesthetic, and his portraits of women often bear a striking resemblance to each other.\r The painting has been in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. since donated in 1937, and is no. 34 in the de Vos catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the artist. It has been described as \"famous among all portraits of women of all schools\".\r The woman, who is probably in her late teens or early twenties, is shown half-length and in three-quarters profile, set against a two-dimensional interior background of deep blue-green. The background is flat and lacks the attention to detail common in van der Weyden's devotional works. Like his contemporary Jan van Eyck (c.\u00a01395 \u2013 1441), when working in portraiture, he used dark planes to focus attention on the sitter. It was not until Hans Memling (c.\u00a01435\u20131494), a pupil of van der Weyden, that a Netherlandish artist set a portrait against an exterior or landscape. In this work the flat setting allows the viewer to settle on the woman's face and quiet self-possession. Van der Weyden reduces his focus to four basic features: the woman's headdress, dress, face and hands. The background has darkened with age; it is likely that the angles created by the sitter's hennin and dress were once much sharper.\r The woman wears an elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur at the neck and wrist. Her clothes are of the then-fashionable Burgundian style, which emphasises the tall and thin aesthetic of the Gothic ideal. Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention to the structure of the clothing\u2014the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position\u2014is typical for the artist.\n", "\nArtist: Rogier van der Weyden\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Antoine, bastard of Burgundy\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden/portrait-of-antoine-bastard-of-burgundy-1460\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Antoine, 'Grand B\u00e2tard' of Burgundy (or Portrait of Anthony of Burgundy) is an oil panel painting by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden portraying Anthony of Burgundy, the bastard son of Philip the Good and one of his mistresses, Jeanne de Presle. The panel is dated to about 1460 and held in the Mus\u00e9es royaux des Beaux-Arts, Belgium. He wears the livery collar of Order of the Golden Fleece, a chivalric order established January 10, 1430, by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. In 1456 Anthony was inducted into the prestigious Order, held by only 29 others at that time. The exact significance of the arrow held in the bastard's hand is unknown, although the fleece is thought to refer to either the Greek mythological hero Jason or the Hebrew warrior and judge Gideon.\r The work is one of three high-profile van der Weyden portraits commissioned by the Dukes of Burgundy around 1460. The other two are his portraits of Philip the Good and Charles the Bold. In common with most of van der Weyden's male portraits, Antoine is shown half profile, staring aloofly into the middle distance.\r In his later commissioned portraits, van der Weyden typically flattered his sitters. He often idealised or softened their facial features, allowing them a handsomeness or beauty, or interest or intelligence they might not have been blessed with in life. If this portrait is compared to the unromantic portrait of Antoine attributed to Hans Memling, painted 8\u201310 years later, one can see the liberties taken by van der Weyden. Even allowing for aging, the artist seems to have enlarged the eyes, defined the contours of the face, and given a much stronger jaw than seen in Memling's portrait.\n", "\nArtist: Rogier van der Weyden\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Francesco d'Este\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden/portrait-of-francesco-d-este-1460\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Francesco d'Este is a small oil on wood panel painting by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden dating to around 1460. The work is in good condition and has been in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York since 1931. When attributed as a van der Weyden in the early 20th century, there was much speculation amongst art historians as to the sitter's identity. He was identified as a member of the d'Este family from the crest on the reverse, and long thought to be Francesco's father Lionello, an Italian and highly placed Burgundian prince and patron of Rogier. In 1939 Ernst Kantorowicz identified the man as Lionello's illegitimate son Francesco (c. 1430 \u2013 after 1475), which is now generally accepted. The panel was painted when the sitter was about 30 years old and is considered one of van der Weyden's finest portraits, in many ways a culmination of his later, more austere work.\r Van der Weyden sought to flatter d'Este; although not handsome, he is shown as broad chested, with a sensitive and cultured face, keen expression, long neck and aquiline nose. The hammer and ring (the latter only revealed after a 1934 cleaning) clutched in his hand are likely intended as status symbols although their exact significance has not been positively identified. Typically of van der Weyden, the sitter's fingers are highly detailed and prominent, shown as almost resting on the lower left of the panel frame, and are long, bony and highly detailed. The painting is unusually secular for the time, seeking to flatter d'Este's worldly position, rather than highlight his devotional worth or personal humility.\r The portrait follows the structural conventions of van der Weyden's late career male portraits. It is a half length, three-quarters view of the sitter against a plain and shallow background. The background is one of its most striking features, its shallowness at odds with the deep, shadowed and atmospheric kind popular in Northern art since van Eyck. That the background is layered with white rather the more typical dark grey and black tones has been remarked on by many art historians.\r The paintings of the Early Netherlandish masters fell out of fashion after the 16th century, and many disappeared from record only to re-emerge in the 19th century. This work was lost until sometime in the late 1800s when came into the collection of Sir Audley Neeld. There was much speculation as to the identity of the sitter, he was early identified as a member of the d'Este family from the crest shown on the back of the panel. In the early 20th century he was thought to be Francesco's father Leonello, based on similarities to the subject of a portrait of Pisanello. Leonello would have been around 42 at the time, and died from a cranial abscess the following year.\r At another the time the panel was titled Portrait of a Goldsmith, presumably based on a misunderstanding of the significance of the hammer held in d'Este's right hand. Francesco's identity as sitter was established in 1939\u201340 by the art historian Ernst Kantorowicz. His representation here bears striking resemblance to a documented contemporary portrait found in a piece of iconography in Rome, as well as to an attributed portrait in the National Gallery of Art, Washington.\n", "\nArtist: Rogier van der Weyden\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Philippe de Croy\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden/portrait-of-philippe-de-croy-1460\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Diptych of Philip de Cro\u00ff with The Virgin and Child consists of a pair of small oil-on-oak panels painted c. 1460 by the Netherlandish artist Rogier van der Weyden. While the authorship and dating of both works are not in doubt, it is believed but not proven that they were created as wings of a devotional diptych and that at some unknown time the panels were broken apart. A diptych panel fitting the description of the Mary wing was described in a 1629 inventory of paintings owned by Alexandre d'Arenberg, a descendant of Philip I de Cro\u00ff (1435\u20131511). Both have been approximately dated to 1460 and are now in Antwerp and San Marino, CA respectively. The reverse of de Cro\u00ff's portrait is inscribed with the family crest and the title used by the sitter from 1454 to 1461.\r The right hand panel depicts Philip I de Cro\u00ff, chamberlain to Philip the Good and comte de Chimay from 1472 until his death, possibly at battle, in 1482. De Cro\u00ff would have been around 25 at the time of the portrait, and the style of his haircut has been used to approximately date the work. The left wing, today in San Marino, shows the Virgin and Child against a gold background depicted in a style indebted to Byzantine Marian icons.\r Van der Weyden underscores the idea of the Virgin panel being an unearthly apparition before the donor by giving her wing a golden background which contrasting sharply with de Cro\u00ff's more muted and ordinary flat backdrop. The artist further establishes a link between the human and divine through the playful manner of given to Christ. As with van der Weyden's other mother and child diptych's the child faces the donor, while his hand is stretched outwards, almost beyond the boundary of the right hand panel, as if to make a connection with the donor to the left. Art historian Martha Wolff suggests the implication of this gesture is to extend the connection to the actual viewer presumably worshiping at the diptych -like de Cro\u00ff- before the mother and child.\r After van der Weyden's appointment as official painter to the city of Brussels in 1436, he became a highly sought after painter of both secular and donor portraits. While the surviving works of his mid career are mainly single religious works and triptychs, by c. 1460 his reputation and the demand for his work was such that he seems to have concentrated on commissions. These panels are amongst four confirmed diptychs where he paired the patron opposite a representation of the Virgin and Child. In all a half-length male patron is represented on the left wing, with the tell-tale motif of hands folded in prayer. The Virgin and Child are always positioned on the right, reflecting the Christian reverence for the right hand side as the \"place of honour\" alongside the divine. Similarly, the donor's portrait is always set against a flat dark nondescript background, while the Virgin and Child are framed against brilliantly lit golden or gilded backdrops. van der Weyden is widely credited as the first to use the diptych format for donor portraits and for establishing conventions that were to last until the mid 16th century; his are the first to combine a half length portrait (of the donor) with a half length depiction of a saint or saints. The pairing with the Mary panel appeared as if a vision appearing before the donor.\n", "\nArtist: Rogier van der Weyden\nArtwork Name: Saint John Altarpiece\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden/saint-john-altarpiece-1460\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Altar of St. John is a c. 1455 oil-on-oak wood panel altarpiece by the Early Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden, now in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin. The triptych is linked to the artist's earlier Miraflores Altarpiece in its symbolic motifs, format and intention.\r The panels show \u2013 from left to right \u2013 the birth of Saint John, the baptism of Christ by John in Jordan, and the beheading of John, with the rather attractive Salome receiving the disembodied head on a plate. Each panel is set within painted archivolts, which contain painted reliefs depicting statuettes of the apostles, and scenes from the lives of both Christ and John, with the overall theme of salvation. The faux sculptural reliefs are painted in grisaille, and give the impression that the scenes are set within a church.\r There are two extant versions of the altarpiece, almost equal in size, leading to complexities in establishing attribution and authenticity. The version in Berlin is considered the original, that in Frankfurt a near contemporary copy.\r The three panels describe the major events in John's life: his birth, baptism of Christ, and his decapitation at the hands of Salome. The reliefs in the archivolts detail secondary events from his life. The overall theme is of the sacraments, each panel can be associated with a specific liturgical ceremony. Of the six archivolt scenes, four detail scenes of Mary's life, including the \"Marriage of the Virgin\", the \"Annunciation\" and the \"Birth of Christ\".\r The archivolts of this panel show the angel appearing to John's father Zacharias, in the temple. According to Luke 1:12\u201317, an angel of the Lord had earlier appeared and announced to Zechariah that his wife would give birth to a son, whom he was to name John, and that this son would be the forerunner of the Lord. Citing their advanced age, Zechariah asked with disbelief for a sign so he would know the truth of this prophecy. In reply, the angel identified himself as Gabriel, sent by God, and stated that because of Zechariah's doubt he would be struck dumb and \"not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed\". This punishment of muteness is referred to in the archivolt reliefs.\r Zacharias appears in the main panel sitting in the foreground with a pen and scroll. To his right, Mary presents his son to him. By including the Virgin, Rogier strays from the Gospel account of the scene, referring instead to the apocryphal version popularised by the Golden Legend and the Meditations on the Life of Christ, both of which have Mary presenting the child John. Erwin Panofsky suggests that Rogier might have been influenced by Andrea Pisano's relief The Naming of the Baptist at the Florence Baptistery, which shows a similar scene of Mary presenting to Zechariah, who sits holding a pen and scroll.\r In the central panel John can be identified by his red robe. This panel shows the apparition of God in the sky above painted in red hues, from which emanates a curved Latin script, above a dove. The panels are typical of the harmony and unity characteristic of Rogier; especially in the manner in which the figures echo each other. This is most evident in the figure of the woman in the birth panel, who occupies the same space and resembles Salome to the far right.\n", "\nArtist: Rogier van der Weyden\nArtwork Name: Crucifixion Diptych\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden/crucifixion-diptych-1460-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nCrucifixion Diptych \u2014 also known as Philadelphia Diptych, Calvary Diptych, Christ on the Cross with the Virgin and St. John, or The Crucifixion with the Virgin and Saint John the Evangelist Mourning \u2014 is a diptych by the Early Netherlandish artist Rogier van der Weyden, completed c. 1460, today in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The panels are noted for their technical skill, visceral impact and for possessing a physicality and directness unusual for Netherlandish art of the time. The Philadelphia Museum of Art describes work as the \"greatest Old Master painting in the Museum.\"\r The painting's provenance prior to the mid-19th century is unknown. Its extreme starkness has led art historians to theorize that it was created as a devotional work, possibly for a Carthusian monastery. It is not known if the panels comprised a self-contained diptych, two-thirds of a triptych, or originally were a single panel. Some art historians have mentioned that the work seems unbalanced overall and lacking symmetry (which might indicate a missing panel or panels). Recent scholarship proposes that the panels functioned as the outer shutters of a carved altarpiece.\r The background to the panels is unknown. Scholars have theorized that they could be the left and center panels of a triptych, that they formed either the wings or shutters of an altarpiece, or that they were intended to decorate an organ case. The train of the Virgin's robe continues onto the right panel, which evidences that the panels were intended to lay side-by-side rather than separated (as the wings of an altarpiece would have been). Art historian E. P. Richardson proposed that they were the center panel of the lost Cambrai altarpiece (executed between 1455 and 1459), a single painting now split into two parts.\r Art historian Penny Howell Jolly was the first to propose that the diptych was painted for an unnamed Carthusian monastery. Carthusians lived a severely ascetic existence: absolute silence, isolation in one's cell except for daily Mass and Vespers, a communal meal only on Sundays and festival days, bread and water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, clothes and bedding of the coarsest materials. Van der Weyden's son Cornelis entered the Carthusian Monastery of Herrines about 1449, and was invested in the order in 1450. The artist donated money and paintings to the order during his lifetime, and made a bequest to it in his will. His only daughter Margaretha became a Dominican nun. Art historian Dirk de Vos describes the diptych as a \"monastically inspired devotional painting\" whose composition was \"largely determined by the scetic worship of the Carthusians and Dominicans.\"\r In a paper presented at the 2006 convention of the Historians of Netherlandish Art, Philadelphia Museum of Art conservator Mark S. Tucker observed that the wooden panels were unusually thin. Across the back of each, he found a horizontal line of dowel holes near the base, which strongly indicated a now-missing structural member. He compared this with similar joinery on the shutters of altarpieces, and theorized that the diptych represented two panels of a four-panel work \u2013 either the two-panelled left shutter of an altarpiece, or its center two panels. Based on pictorial style, Tucker argued that the large size of the human figures relative to the size of the panels was more in keeping with figures on the shutters of carved altarpieces than painted ones. He also noted that the shutters of carved altarpieces tend to de-emphasize the deep perspective commonly seen in painted altarpieces, which was consistent with the shallow pictorial space of the diptych.\n", "\nArtist: Rogier van der Weyden\nArtwork Name: Madonna with the saints\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden/madonna-with-the-saints\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Medici Madonna is an oil-on-panel painting by the Netherlandish artist Rogier van der Weyden, dating from around 1460\u20131464 and housed in the St\u00e4del, Frankfurt, Germany.\r The work is known to have been commissioned by the Medici family in Florence, as testified by the Florentine coat of arms with a red lily at the center of the lower step. The work has been variously dated from 1450\u20131451, when the artist travelled to Rome visiting several Italian courts, or from 1460\u20131464, the same years of the Lamentation of Christ, inspired by Beato Angelico and now at the Uffizi.\r Above a gold background, van der Weyden painted a baldachin lined with precious damask cloth, under which are the Virgin with Child, St. Peter, St. John the Baptist (patron saint of Florence), St. Cosmas (a protector of the House of Medici), and St. Damian. Cosmas is portrayed while putting a coin in a handbag hanging from his belt, a reference of his legend, according to which he had accepted a small sum for a medical performance, causing rage in his brother Damian.\r In the foreground is a still life with the artist's typical attention to natural details.

The panel was thus one of the works commissioned by the Medici to van der Weyden, including the Medici Madonna now at St\u00e4del of Frankfurt, which has been also assigned to the artist's trip to Italy in 1450. Another hypothesis is that the panel was part of a lost triptych painted for Lionello d'Este of Ferrara, and mentioned in 1449, or that it was the painting described by Giorgio Vasari as Hans Memling's.\r The panel adopts the same scheme in Fra Angelico's Piet\u00e0 for the predella of the San Marco Altarpiece (1438\u20131443), now at the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, confirming that the Flemish artist visited Florence during his pilgrimage in Italy of 1449-1450, as mentioned in De viribus illustribus by Bartolomeo Facio (c. 1456). The work was later part of the collections of cardinal Carlo de' Medici, being moved to the Uffizi Gallery in 1666. Filippo Baldinucci described it as a work by Albrecht D\u00fcrer. In 1989 it was still assigned to Hans Memling by some scholars, but in 1992 reflex photography showed the underlying drawing, which was clearly executed by van der Weyden.\r The painting has a rectangular shape, and shows Christ being buried with the weeping Mary and John the Evangelist holding his hands. The corpse is supported by a richly dressed. and by Nicodemus dressed in refined clothing of the times and gazing out towards the spectator, once thought to be a self-portrait of the artist which is now known to portray Cosimo the elder. A kneeling Mary Magdalene is depicted in the low foreground.\r The composition is similar to Angelico's Piet\u00e0, but the scene here is more complex and crowded, with less geometrically ordered lines and more anguished faces. The use of oil paint also allowed van der Weyden to obtain deeper colours and a more brilliant light. The attention to details is also typical of the early Netherlandish painting school.\n", "\nArtist: Andrea del Verrocchio\nArtwork Name: The Baptism of Christ\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrochio/the-baptism-of-christ-1475\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Baptism of Christ is a painting finished around 1475 in the studio of the Italian Renaissance painter Andrea del Verrocchio and generally ascribed to him and his pupil Leonardo da Vinci. Some art historians discern the hands of other members of Verrocchio's  workshop in the painting as well.   The picture depicts the Baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist as recorded in the Biblical Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke. The angel to the left is recorded as having been painted by the youthful Leonardo, a fact which has excited so much special comment and mythology, that the importance and value of the picture as a whole and within the \u0153uvre of Verrocchio is often overlooked. Modern critics also attribute much of the landscape in the background and the figure of Christ to Leonardo da Vinci as well. The painting is housed in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.   Andrea del Verrocchio was a sculptor, goldsmith and painter who ran a large and successful workshop in Florence in the second half of the 15th century. Among his apprentices and close associates were the painters Botticelli, Botticini, Lorenzo di Credi and Leonardo da Vinci.   Verrocchio was not himself a prolific painter and very few pictures are attributed to his hand, his fame lying chiefly in his sculptured works. Verrocchio's paintings, as are typical of Florentine works of that date, are in tempera on wooden panel. The technique of painting artworks in paint, previously used in Italy only for durable items like parade shields, was introduced to Florence by Dutch and Flemish painters and their imported works at around the date that this painting was created.  The painting The Baptism of Christ was, according to Antonio Billi (1515), commissioned by the Church of S. Salvi, and was later transferred to the Vallumbrosan Sisterhood in Santa Verdiana. In 1810 it entered the collection of the Accademia and passed to the Uffizi in 1959. In the 16th century the work was discussed in Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Painters in the biographies of both Verrocchio and Leonardo da Vinci.\n", "\nArtist: Andrea del Verrocchio\nArtwork Name: Equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni\nArtwork Genre: portrait,sculpture\nArtwork Media: bronze\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrochio/equestrian-statue-of-bartolomeo-colleoni\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni is a Renaissance sculpture in Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice, Italy, executed by Andrea del Verrocchio in 1480\u201388. Portraying the condottiero Bartolomeo Colleoni (who served for a long time under the Republic of Venice), it has a height of 395 cm excluding the pedestal. It is the second major equestrian monument of the Italian Renaissance, after Donatello's equestrian statue of Gattamelata (1453).  In 1475 the Condottiero Colleoni, a former Captain General of the Republic of Venice, died and by his will left a substantial part of his estate to the Republic on condition that a statue of himself should be commissioned and set up in the Piazza San Marco. In 1479 the Republic announced that it would accept the legacy, but that (as statues were not permitted  in the Piazza) the statue would be placed in the open space in front of the Scuola of San Marco. A competition was arranged to enable a sculptor to be selected. Three sculptors competed for the contract, Verrocchio from Florence, Alessandro Leopardi from Venice and Bartolomeo Vellano from Padua. Verrocchio made a wooden model of his proposed sculpture, while the others made models of wax and terracotta. The three models were exhibited in Venice in 1483 and the contract was awarded to Verrocchio. He then opened a workshop in Venice and made the final wax model which was ready to be cast in bronze, but he died in 1488, before this was done.   He had asked that his pupil Lorenzo di Credi, who was then in charge of his workshop in Florence,  should be entrusted with the finishing of the statue, but the Venetian state after considerable delay commissioned Alessandro Leopardi to do this and the statue was eventually erected on a pedestal made by Leopardi in the Campo SS. Giovanni e Paolo  where it stands today.  Verrocchio based the sculpture on Donatello's statue of Gattamelata, as well as on  the ancient statue of Marcus Aurelius in  Rome, the St. Mark's Horses in Venice, the Regisole (a late antiquity work in Pavia, now lost), and the frescoes of the Funerary Monument to Sir John Hawkwood by Paolo Uccello and of the  Equestrian Monument to Niccol\u00f2 da Tolentino by Andrea del Castagno.  The main problem he had to face was of statics: representing the horse while moving, with a raised leg, could cause stability problems due to the excessive weight of the bronze being supported only by three relatively thin legs. Donatello, in his monument at Padua, had partially solved the problem by putting the raised leg on a sphere. Verrocchio was the first to solve the problem in having the horse supported by three legs.  Although it was not placed where Colleoni had intended, art historian  Passavent emphasised how fine it looks in its actual position, writing that \"the magnificent sense of movement in this figure is shown to superb advantage in its present setting\" and that, as sculpture, \"it far surpasses anything the century had yet aspired to or thought possible\". He points out that both man and horse are equally fine and together are inseparable parts of the sculpture.\n", "\nArtist: Quentin Matsys\nArtwork Name: An Old Woman (The Ugly Duchess)\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/quentin-matsys/an-old-woman-the-ugly-duchess\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Ugly Duchess (also known as A Grotesque Old Woman) is a satirical portrait painted by the Flemish artist Quentin Matsys around 1513.\r The painting is in oil on an oak panel, and measures 62.4 by 45.5 cm. It shows a grotesque old woman with wrinkled skin and withered breasts. She wears the aristocratic horned headdress of her youth, out of fashion by the time of the painting, and holds in her right hand a red flower, then a symbol of engagement, indicating that she is trying to attract a suitor. However, it has been described as a bud that will 'likely never blossom'. The work is Matsys' best-known painting.\r The painting was long thought to have been derived from a putative lost work by Leonardo da Vinci, on the basis of its striking resemblance to two caricature drawings of heads commonly attributed to the Italian artist. However the caricatures are now thought to be based on the work of Matsys, who is known to have exchanged drawings with Leonardo.\r A possible literary influence is Erasmus's essay In Praise of Folly (1511), which satirizes women who \"still play the coquette\", \"cannot tear themselves away from their mirrors\" and \"do not hesitate to exhibit their repulsive withered breasts\". The woman has been often identified as Margaret, Countess of Tyrol, claimed by her enemies to be ugly; however, she had died 150 years earlier. In 2008 Michael Baum, emeritus professor of surgery at University College London, suggested that the sitter suffered from a rare form of Paget's disease, in which the victim's bones enlarge and become deformed.\r The painting is in the collection of the National Gallery in London, to which it was bequeathed by Jenny Louisa Roberta Blaker in 1947. It was originally half of a diptych, with a Portrait of an Old Man, in the Mus\u00e9e Jacquemart-Andr\u00e9, Paris, which was lent to the National Gallery in 2008 for an exhibition in which the two paintings were hung side by side.\r The portrait is thought to be a source for John Tenniel's 1869 illustrations of the Duchess in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\n", "\nArtist: Quentin Matsys\nArtwork Name: Ill-Matched Marriage (The Marriage Contract)\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/quentin-matsys/ill-matched-marriage-the-marriage-contract-1530\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Ill-Matched Marriage (also known as The Marriage Contract) is an oil painting executed by the early Netherlandish master Quentin Matsys, usually dated between 1525 and 1530. The panel, probably inspired by an original lost drawing of Leonardo da Vinci, illustrates an appealing subject in the history of art: the marriage for economic reasons between persons of different ages. The painting is housed in the S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art. It was donated to the museum in 1965 by the Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza.\r .\r The marriage for economic reasons between persons of different ages has always been an appealing subject in the history of art, for being useful in the rendering of a social critic of strong visual impact. Many artists such as Goya, Leonardo da Vinci, D\u00fcrer and Lucas Cranach the Elder have dedicated works and studies to this subject. It is more common the representation of an old man marrying with a younger woman, often led to matrimony by the interest of the family. Matsys himself made another version of this theme, in conformity with this iconographic tradition - currently housed in the National Gallery of Art, in Washington. But in this Ill-Matched Marriage the opposite happens: a rich old woman marries a young man.\r The old title of this painting was The Marriage Contract. The current title seems more adequate for its bigger precision and because the illustrated subject fully belongs to the Renaissance iconography of the Sposalizio Grottesco (\"Grotesque Marriage\", in Italian), largely spread in the Italian painting of the 15th and 16th centuries.\r Matsys' narrative is solid and doesn't give occasion to doubts. Meanwhile being caressed by the young man, the old lady offers him a wedding ring with her right hand and, at the same time, opens her bag, smoothed by the man's left hand. The mockery, hypocrisy and the foolishness temper of the scene is highlighted by the burlesque features of the characters and, in particular, by the figure at the right, represented in the ambiguous act of putting inside a box the necklace spread on the table.\r The subject of the \"grotesque marriage\" is also present in the satirical literature, as in the poem The Ship of Fools by Sebastian Brant (1494), which in its 52nd chapter, tackles about the \"marriage-for-money\" theme. The subject is resumed, brimful of mockery and humor, by Erasmus of Rotterdam, in his The Praise of Folly (1509).\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: The Fight between Carnival and Lent\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/the-fight-between-carnival-and-lent-1559-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Fight Between Carnival and Lent is an oil-on-panel work painted by Pieter Bruegel the Elder in 1559. This painting depicts a common festival of the period, as celebrated in the Southern Netherlands. It presents the contrast between two sides of contemporary life, as can be seen by the appearance of the inn on the left side\u2014for enjoyment, and the church on the right side\u2014for religious observance.\r The busy scene depicts well-behaved children near the church and a beer drinking scene near the inn. At the centre is a well, showing the coming together of different parts of the community, and other scenes show a fish stall and two competing floats.\r A battle enacted between the figures Carnival and Lent was an important event in community life in early modern Europe, representing the transition between two different seasonal cuisines: livestock that was not to be wintered was slaughtered, and meat was in good supply. As the period of Lent commenced, with its enforced abstinence and the concomitant spiritual purification in preparation for Easter, the butcher shops closed and the butchers traveled into the countryside to purchase cattle for the spring.\r Bruegel's painting is rich in allegories and symbolisms that have been long studied. It is often read as the triumph of Lent, since the figure of Carnival seems to bid farewell with his left hand and his eyes lifted to the sky. A more generalised meaning may be the illustration of Bruegel's belief that human activities are motivated by folly and self-seeking.\r The painting defies any linear narrative, but one may divide it into two sections: the popular and the religious. The scene is set in a town's market square (a traditional setting for the Carnival), with the figure of Carnival impersonated by a fat man who led a procession through the town and presided over a large feast. In some traditions an effigy of the Carnival figure was burned at the end of the celebrations.\r In Bruegel's painting the figure is a large man riding a beer barrel with a pork chop attached to its front end. He is wearing a huge meat pie as a head-dress; he is wielding a long spit, complete with a pig's head, as a weapon for the fight. The pouch of knives at his belt indicates that he is a butcher\u2014the guild of butchers traditionally provided the meat for the carnival feast so his place at the procession's heart is apt. The man behind the barrel is dressed in yellow, which is connected with deceit, and he is followed by a female figure who is carrying on her head a table with bread and waffles on it. In one hand she holds a tumbler and in the other a candle, again allegorical symbols for deceit. Beside her is a lute-player, which was a frequent symbol of Lutheranism. The Lutherans had abolished Lent but still celebrated the Carnival. A tavern filled with drinkers and onlookers watch the performance of a popular farce known as The Dirty Bride. At the street crossing a group of cripples have come out to beg, while behind them, led by a bagpiper, a procession of lepers walks past.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: Netherlandish Proverbs\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/netherlandish-proverbs-1559\n\nWikipedia Article:\nNetherlandish Proverbs (Dutch: Nederlandse Spreekwoorden; also called Flemish Proverbs, The Blue Cloak or The Topsy Turvy World) is a 1559 oil-on-oak-panel painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder that depicts a scene in which humans and, to a lesser extent, animals and objects, offer literal illustrations of Dutch language proverbs and idioms.\r Running themes in Bruegel's paintings are the absurdity, wickedness and foolishness of humans, and this is no exception. The painting's original title, The Blue Cloak or The Folly of the World, indicates that Bruegel's intent was not just to illustrate proverbs, but rather to catalog human folly. Many of the people depicted show the characteristic blank features that Bruegel used to portray fools.\r His son, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, specialised in making copies of his father's work and painted at least 16 copies of Netherlandish Proverbs. Not all versions of the painting, by father or son, show exactly the same proverbs and they also differ in other minor details.\r Proverbs were very popular in Bruegel's time and before; a hundred years before Bruegel's painting, illustrations of proverbs had been popular in the Flemish books of hours. A number of collections were published, including Adagia, by the Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus. The French writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais employed significant numbers in his novel Gargantua and Pantagruel, completed in 1564.\r The Flemish artist Frans Hogenberg made an engraving illustrating 43 proverbs in around 1558, roughly the same time as Bruegel's painting. The work is very similar in composition to Bruegel's and includes certain proverbs (like the blue cloak) which also feature prominently in Netherlandish Proverbs. By depicting literal renditions of proverbs in a peasant setting, both artists have shown a \"world turned upside down\".\r Bruegel himself had painted several minor paintings on the subject of proverbs including Big Fish Eat Little Fish (1556) and Twelve Proverbs (1558), but Netherlandish Proverbs is thought to have been his first large-scale painting on the theme.\r Critics have praised the composition for its ordered portrayal and integrated scene. There are approximately 112 identifiable proverbs and idioms in the scene, although Bruegel may have included others which cannot be determined because of the language change. Some of those incorporated in the painting are still in popular use, for instance \"Swimming against the tide\", \"Banging one's head against a brick wall\" and \"Armed to the teeth\". Many more have faded from use, which makes analysis of the painting harder. \"Having one's roof tiled with tarts\", for example, which meant to have an abundance of everything and was an image Bruegel would later feature in his painting of the idyllic Land of Cockaigne (1567).\r The Blue Cloak, the piece's original title, features in the centre of the piece and is being placed on a man by his wife, indicating that she is cuckolding him. Other proverbs indicate human foolishness. A man fills in a pond after his calf has died. Just above the central figure of the blue-cloaked man another man carries daylight in a basket. Some of the figures seem to represent more than one figure of speech (whether this was Bruegel's intention or not is unknown), such as the man shearing a sheep in the centre bottom left of the picture. He is sitting next to a man shearing a pig, so represents the expression \"One shears sheep and one shears pigs\", meaning that one has the advantage over the other, but may also represent the advice \"Shear them but don't skin them\", meaning make the most of available assets.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: Landscape with the Fall of Icarus\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/landscape-with-the-fall-of-icarus-1560\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLandscape with the Fall of Icarus is a painting in oil on canvas measuring 73.5 by 112 centimetres (28.9\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a044.1\u00a0in) in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels. It was long thought to be by the leading painter of Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting, Pieter Bruegel the Elder. However, following technical examinations in 1996 of the painting hanging in the Brussels museum that attribution is regarded as very doubtful, and the painting, perhaps painted in the 1560s, is now usually seen as a good early copy by an unknown artist of Bruegel's lost original, perhaps from about 1558. According to the museum: \"It is doubtful the execution is by Breugel the Elder, but the composition can be said with certainty to be his\", although recent technical research has re-opened the question.\r Largely derived from Ovid, the painting is described in W. H. Auden's famous poem \"Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts\", named after the museum in Brussels which holds the painting, and became the subject of a poem of the same name by William Carlos Williams, as well as \"Lines on Bruegel's 'Icarus'\" by Michael Hamburger.\r In Greek mythology, Icarus succeeded in flying, with wings made by his father Daedalus, using feathers secured with bees wax. Ignoring his father's warnings, Icarus chose to fly too close to the sun, melting the wax, and fell into the sea and drowned. His legs can be seen in the water just below the ship. The sun, already half-set on the horizon, is a long way away; the flight did not reach anywhere near it. Daedalus does not appear in this version of the painting, though he does, still flying, in the van Buuren one (see below).\r The ploughman, shepherd and angler are mentioned in Ovid's account of the legend; they are: \"astonished and think to see gods approaching them through the aether\", which is not entirely the impression given in the painting. The shepherd gazing into the air, away from the ship, may be explained by another version of the composition (see below); in the original work there was probably also a figure of Daedalus in the sky to the left, at which he stares. There is also a Flemish proverb (of the sort imaged in other works by Bruegel): \"And the farmer continued to plough...\" (En de boer ... hij ploegde voort\") pointing out the ignorance of people to fellow men's suffering. The painting may, as Auden's poem suggests, depict humankind's indifference to suffering by highlighting the ordinary events which continue to occur, despite the unobserved death of Icarus.\r Though the world landscape, a type of work with the title subject represented by small figures in the distance, was an established type in Early Netherlandish painting, pioneered by Joachim Patiner, to have a much larger unrelated \"genre\" figure in the foreground is original and represents something of a blow against the emerging hierarchy of genres. Other landscapes by Bruegel, for example The Hunters in the Snow (1565) and others in that series of paintings showing the seasons, show genre figures in a raised foreground, but not so large relative to the size of the image, nor with a subject from a \"higher\" class of painting in the background.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: Children's Games\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/children-s-games-1560\n\nWikipedia Article:\nChildren's Games is an oil-on-panel by the Netherlandish Renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, painted in 1560. It is currently held and exhibited at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.\r This painting, mentioned for the first time by Karel van Mander in 1604, was acquired in 1594 by Archduke Ernest of Austria. It has been suggested that it was the first in a projected series of paintings representing the Ages of Man, in which Children's Games would have stood for Youth. If that was Bruegel's intention, it is unlikely that the series progressed beyond this painting, for there are no contemporary or subsequent mentions of related pictures.\r The children, who range in age from toddlers to adolescents, roll hoops, walk on stilts, spin hoops, ride hobby-horses, stage mock tournaments, play leap-frog and blind man's bluff, perform handstands, inflate pigs' bladders and play with dolls and other toys. They have also taken over the large building that dominates the square: it may be a town hall or some other important civic building, in this way emphasizing the moral that the adults who direct civic affairs are as children in the sight of God. This crowded scene is to some extent relieved by the landscape in the top left-hand corner; but even here children are bathing in the river and playing on its banks.\r The artist's intention for this work is more serious than simply to compile an illustrated encyclopaedia of children's games, though some eighty particular games have been identified. Bruegel shows the children absorbed in their games with the seriousness displayed by adults in their apparently more important pursuits. His moral is that in the mind of God children's games possess as much significance as the activities of their parents. This idea was a familiar one in contemporary literature: in an anonymous Flemish poem published in Antwerp in 1530 by Jan van Doesborch\u00a0(nl), mankind is compared to children who are entirely absorbed in their foolish games and concerns.\r Starting from bottom left, the games may be identified as follows:\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: The Fall of the Rebel Angels\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/the-fall-of-the-rebel-angels-1562\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Fall of the Rebel Angels is an oil-on-panel by the Netherlandish Renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, painted in 1562. It is currently held and exhibited at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels.\r Painted in 1562, Bruegel's depiction of this subject is taken from a passage from the Book of Revelation (12, 2-9) and reveals the artist's profound debt to Hieronymous Bosch, especially in the grotesque figures of the fallen angels, shown as half-human, half-animal monsters. Together with Dulle Griet and The Triumph of Death, which have similar dimensions, it was probably painted for the same collector and destined to become part of a series.\r The composition with a central figure placed among many smaller figures was favoured by Bruegel at this time, not only in other paintings such as Dulle Griet, but also in the series of engravings of the Vices and the Virtues which he had just completed for the Antwerp publisher Hieronymous Cock. The archangel Michael and his angels are shown by Bruegel in the act of driving the rebel angels from Heaven. Pride was the sin which caused the fall of Lucifer and his companions, and the conflict of good and evil, vice and virtue, is a theme which recurs constantly in Bruegel's work.\r The painting is used in the music video for the song \u201cBlood Sweat and Tears\u201d by South Korean boyband BTS.\r The painting, along with Heironymous Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights, is alluded to in the song \"Painters of the Tempest, Part Two: Triptych Lux\" by Australian progressive metal band Ne Obliviscaris.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: The Suicide of Saul\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/the-suicide-of-saul\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Suicide of Saul is an oil-on-panel by the Netherlandish Renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, painted in 1562. It is currently held and exhibited at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.\r The inscription identifies the subject as the rarely represented scene of the suicide of Saul after his defeat by the Philistines. These events are described in 1 Samuel 31, 1-5:\r Bruegel has chosen the highly dramatic moment of the death of the armourbearer, just as the Philistines are approaching.\r Saul's death was interpreted as a punishment of pride - it was among the proud that Dante met Saul in the Purgatorio - and this may account for Bruegel's choice of such an unusual subject.\r As with most of his subjects taken from the Bible, Bruegel treats Saul's suicide as a contemporary event, showing the armies in 16th century armour. In 1529 the German painter Albrecht Altdorfer had shown the clash of the forces of Alexander the Great and Darius at the Battle of the Issus in this way, and in many other respects, too, Bruegel is in Altdorfer's debt, particularly in the representation of the tiny, massed figures of the soldiers and their forests of lances. Bruegel may also have looked at the battle-scenes of another German painter, J\u00f6rg Breu the Younger, and at a now lost battle-scene by the Antwerp landscape painter Joachim Patinir which is mentioned by biographer Karel van Mander.\r The Suicide of Saul is an early attempt by Bruegel to reconcile landscape and figure painting. If it is compared with one of his latest works, The Magpie on the Gallows of 1568, its weaknesses are apparent: the foreground and background are not yet reconciled and the jutting outcrop of rock in the centre is a mannerist device which one may see again in The Procession to Calvary. However, the distant landscape is seen through a shimmering haze, which seems to have the effect of emphasizing the foreground detail, and this does represent a new stage in the evolution of Bruegel's depiction of naturalistic landscape.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: The Tower of Babel\nArtwork Genre: cityscape,religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/the-tower-of-babel-1563\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Tower of Babel was the subject of three paintings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. The first, a miniature painted on ivory, was painted while Bruegel was in Rome and is now lost. The two surviving paintings, often distinguished by the prefix \"Great\" and \"Little\", are in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna and the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam respectively. Both are oil paintings on wood panels.\r The Rotterdam painting is about half the size of the Vienna one. In broad terms they have exactly the same composition, but at a detailed level everything is different, whether in the architecture of the tower or in the sky and the landscape around the tower. The Vienna version has a group in the foreground, with the main figure presumably Nimrod, who was believed to have ordered the construction of the tower, although the Bible does not actually say this. In Vienna the tower rises at the edge of a large city, but the Rotterdam tower is in open countryside.\r The paintings depict the construction of the Tower of Babel, which, according to the Book of Genesis in the Bible, was built by a unified, monolingual humanity as a mark of their achievement and to prevent them from scattering: \"Then they said, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.'\" (Genesis 11:4).\r Bruegel's depiction of the architecture of the tower, with its numerous arches and other examples of Roman engineering, is deliberately reminiscent of the Roman Colosseum, which Christians of the time saw as a symbol of both hubris and persecution. Bruegel had visited Rome in 1552\u20131553. Back in Antwerp, he may have refreshed his memory of Rome with a series of engravings of the principal landmarks of the city made by the publisher of his own prints, Hieronymous Cock, for he incorporated details of Cock's engravings of Roman views in both surviving versions of the Tower of Babel.\r The parallel of Rome and Babylon had a particular significance for Bruegel's contemporaries: Rome was the Eternal City, intended by the Caesars to last forever, and its decay and ruin were taken to symbolize the vanity and transience of earthly efforts. The Tower was also symbolic of the religious turmoil between the Catholic church (which at the time conducted all services in Latin) and the polyglot Protestant religion that was increasingly popular in the Netherlands. The subject may have had a specific topicality, as the famous Polyglot Bible in six languages, a landmark in Biblical scholarship, was published in Antwerp in 1566. Although at first glance the tower appears to be a stable series of concentric pillars, upon closer examination it is apparent that none of the layers lies at a true horizontal. Rather the tower is built as an ascending spiral.\r The workers in the painting have built the arches perpendicular to the slanted ground, thereby making them unstable, and a few arches can already be seen crumbling. The foundation and bottom layers of the tower had not been completed before the higher layers were constructed.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: The Triumph of Death\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/the-triumph-of-death-1562-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Triumph of Death is an oil panel painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder painted c. 1562. It has been in the Museo del Prado in Madrid since 1827.\r The painting shows a panorama of an army of skeletons wreaking havoc across a blackened, desolate landscape. Fires burn in the distance, and the sea is littered with shipwrecks. A few leafless trees stud hills otherwise bare of vegetation; fish lie rotting on the shores of a corpse-choked pond. Art historian James Snyder emphasizes the \"scorched, barren earth, devoid of any life as far as the eye can see.\" In this setting, legions of skeletons advance on the living, who either flee in terror or try in vain to fight back. In the foreground, skeletons haul a wagon full of skulls; in the upper left corner, others ring the bell that signifies the death knell of the world. A fool plays the lute while a lady sings; behind both of them a skeleton plays along; a starving dog nibbles at the face of a child; a cross sits in the center of the painting. People are herded into a coffin shaped trap decorated with crosses, while a skeleton on horseback kills people with a scythe. The painting depicts people of different social backgrounds\u00a0\u2013 from peasants and soldiers to nobles as well as a king and a cardinal\u00a0\u2013 being taken by death indiscriminately.\r A skeleton parodies human happiness by playing a hurdy-gurdy while the wheels of his cart crush a man like nothing. A woman has fallen in the path of the death cart; she holds in her hand a spindle and distaff, classical symbols of the fragility of human life. Nearby another woman in the part of the cart has a slender thread which is about to be cut by the scissors in her other hand. Just below her a cardinal is helped towards his fate by a skeleton who mockingly wears the red hat, while a dying king's barrel of gold coins is looted by yet another skeleton. In one detail, a dinner has been broken up and the diners are putting up a futile resistance. They have drawn their swords in order to fight the skeletons dressed in winding-sheets; no less hopelessly, the jester takes refuge beneath the dinner table. The backgammon board and the playing cards have been scattered, while a skeleton thinly disguised with a mask empties away the wine flasks. Above, a woman is being embraced by a skeleton in a hideous parody of after-dinner amorousness. Of the menu of the interrupted meal, all that can be seen are a few pallid rolls of bread and an appetizer apparently consisting of a pared human skull. As the fighting breaks out, a skeleton in a hooded robe mockingly seems to bring another dish, also consisting of human bones, to the table.\r The painting shows aspects of everyday life in the mid-sixteenth century. Clothes are clearly depicted, as are pastimes such as playing cards and backgammon. It shows objects such as musical instruments, an early mechanical clock, scenes including a funeral service, and various methods of execution, including the breaking wheel, the gallows, and the headsman. In one scene a human is the prey of a skeleton-hunter and his dogs. In another scene a man with a grinding stone around his neck is about to be thrown into the pond by the skeleton.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: Landscape with the Flight into Egypt\nArtwork Genre: landscape,religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/landscape-with-the-flight-into-egypt-1563\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLandscape with the Flight into Egypt is a 1563 oil on wooden board painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, showing the biblical Flight into Egypt of Mary and Joseph with the infant Jesus.

The painting is dominated by tones of brown and green for the land, and the blue of the water and sky. Mary's unusual red cloak (rather than her traditional blue) and white headgear makes her stand out against the blue of the river, while Joseph's greyish clothes contrast with the green and brown background of wooded hills. In the background, the buildings of towns are faintly visible on each side of the river.\r On the tree stump to the right, a pagan statue has fallen out of its shrine as the family passed by, symbolising the triumph of Christ over paganism. This was one of a number of miraculous incidents that medieval legend had added to the very brief biblical story. A branch fallen against a tree creates a cross, presaging the crucifixion. Two tiny salamanders, symbols of evil, can be seen below the figures (very near the bottom edge).\r The painting is signed \"BRVEGEL MDLXIII\". It was owned by Brueghel's patron Cardinal Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle (1517\u20131586), an important administrator in the Habsburg Netherlands. The painting is mentioned in an inventory of 1607; it is the only painting which can be certainly identified as belonging to him. It was later owned by the artist Peter Paul Rubens, who owned ten or eleven other Bruegels. It was not well known when it was auctioned at Christie's in London in 1939, and bought by Count Antoine Seilern. Together with the other Bruegel in the collection, Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery, it was donated to the Courtauld Institute of Art in the Princes Gate bequest in 1978.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: The Procession to Calvary\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/christ-carrying-the-cross-1564\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Procession to Calvary is an oil-on-panel by the Netherlandish Renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder of Christ carrying the Cross set in a large landscape, painted in 1564. It is in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.\r This is the second-largest known painting by Bruegel. It is one of sixteen paintings by him which are listed in the inventory of the wealthy Antwerp collector, Niclaes Jonghelinck, drawn up in 1566. It was Jonghelinck who commissioned the Months from Bruegel and he may also have commissioned this work. Jonghelinck's Bruegels passed into the possession of the city of Antwerp in the year in which the inventory was made. In 1604 it was recorded in the Prague collections of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, then transferred to Vienna, and in 1809 (until 1815) in Paris, requisitioned by Napoleon Bonaparte as part of his war booty.\r For Bruegel the composition is unusually traditional. Perhaps because he was treating such a solemn religious event, he adopted a well-known scheme, used previously by the Brunswick Monogrammist and Bruegel's Antwerp contemporary, Pieter Aertsen. Christ's insignificance among the crowds is a familiar device of mannerist painting (it recurs in the Preaching of John the Baptist, as well as The Conversion of Paul), as is the artificial placing of Mary and her companions in a rocky foreground, which is deliberately distanced from the dramatic events taking place behind them.\r Bruegel's treatment of landscape evolves in the course of his career from the bird's-eye views and extensive landscapes of the Large landscape series to the remarkable naturalism of the Months. Impossibly sheer outcrops of rock like this one at left characterize the landscape tradition of the Antwerp school founded by Joachim Patinir. Patinir's followers - in particular Herri met de Bles, Matthys Cock (the brother of Bruegel's print publisher, Hieronymous Cock) and Cornelis Matsys - had turned his style into a popular but stale formula. The sequence of Bruegel's landscape drawings and of the landscape in his paintings shows the gradual abandonment of this formula. In this case, however, his desire to convey the rocky, unfamiliar terrain of the Holy Land causes him to fall back on the ready-made landscape features of the Antwerp school.\r In a detail such as this at right, Bruegel's painting possesses a vividness which would seem to come from his observation of contemporary life. Public executions were a familiar feature of 16th century life, especially in troubled Flanders. Here Bruegel shows the two thieves who were to hang on either side of Christ being trundled to the place of execution. Anachronistically, both clutch crucifixes and are making their final confessions to the cowled priests beside them. The thieves, their confessors and the ghoulish spectators who surround the cart are all in contemporary dress. In Bruegel's day public executions were well attended occasions which had the air of festivals or carnivals. Here Bruegel shows the absolute indifference of the gawping crowds to the fear and misery of the condemned men. (Elsewhere in the picture he shows the pickpockets and the pedlars who preyed upon the crowds at such events.) It is noteworthy that Bruegel makes no distinction between the two thieves, one of whom Christ was to bless.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: Dulle Griet (Mad Meg)\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/dulle-griet-mad-meg-1564\n\nWikipedia Article:\nDulle Griet (anglicized as Dull Gret), also known as Mad Meg, is a figure of Flemish folklore who is the subject of a 1563 oil-on-panel by Flemish renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder. The painting depicts a virago, Dulle Griet, who leads an army of women to pillage Hell, and is currently held and exhibited at the Museum Mayer van den Bergh in Antwerp.\r A restoration of the painting revealed in 2018 that it was painted in 1563, shortly after the painter had moved to Brussels. Previously, the signature and the date on the painting had been illegible, and it had been assumed that it would have been painted two years earlier, or, based on its close compositional and stylistic similarity to The Fall of the Rebel Angels and The Triumph of Death, one year earlier. Like those pictures, Dulle Griet owes much to Hieronymus Bosch. It is assumed the painting was destined for a series.\r Bruegel's earliest biographer, Karel van Mander, writing in 1604, described the painting as \"Dulle Griet, who is looking at the mouth of Hell\". It came into the collections of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, then was looted by the Swedish troops in 1648, and reappeared in Stockholm in 1800. Art collector Fritz Mayer van den Bergh discovered it in 1897 at an auction in Cologne, where he bought it for a minimal sum, discovering its actual author a few days later.\r Griet was a disparaging name given to any bad-tempered, shrewish woman. Her mission refers to the Flemish proverb:\r Bruegel is thus making fun of noisy, aggressive women. At the same time he castigates the sin of covetousness: although already burdened down with possessions, Griet and her grotesque companions are prepared to storm the mouth of Hell itself in their search for more.\r Dulle Griet appears as a character in Caryl Churchill's play Top Girls (1982), where she recounts her invasion of Hell: \"I'd had enough, I was mad, I hate the bastards. I come out my front door that morning and shout till my neighbors come out and I said, 'Come on, we're going where the evil come from and pay the bastards out.'\" (Churchill, 28).\r While her female followers loot a house, Griet advances towards the mouth of Hell through a landscape populated by Boschian monsters. They represent the sins that are punished there. Griet wears male armour \u2014 a breastplate, a mailed glove and a metal cap; her military costume is parodied by the monster in a helmet beside her, who pulls up a drawbridge. A knife hangs from her side, while in her right she carries a sword, which may refer to the saying: \"He could go to Hell with a sword in his hand.\" A book of proverbs published in Antwerp in 1568 contains a saying which is very close in spirit to Bruegel's painting:\r The pigment analysis was conducted by the scientists at the Ghent University. Bruegel used the cheap smalt for the robe of the central figure of Mad Meg instead of the more expensive ultramarine together with vermilion and copper resinate.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: The Adoration of the Kings\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/the-adoration-of-the-kings-1564\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Adoration of the Kings is an oil-on-panel painting of the Adoration of the Magi by the Netherlandish Renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, painted in 1564, and now in the National Gallery, London.\r In the chronological sequence of Bruegel's work, this painting of 1564 marks an important departure as the first to be composed almost exclusively of large figures. The group of people, taken from Italian mannerist painters like Parmigianino, permits Bruegel to concentrate on individual faces, giving each a quite distinct, and sometimes grotesque, expression.\r This emphasis on the uniqueness of each figure, and Bruegel's lack of interest in depicting ideal beauty in the Italian manner, makes it clear that although borrowing an Italian compositional scheme, Bruegel is putting it to quite a different use. In this treatment, the painter's first purpose is to record the range and intensity of individual reactions to the sacred event.\r Below a series of images detailing Bruegel's painting:\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: The Gloomy Day (January)\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/the-gloomy-day-1559\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Gloomy Day is an oil on wood painting by Pieter Bruegel in 1565.

As in many of his paintings, the focus is on peasants and their work. Notably, some of the peasants are shown eating while others are harvesting wheat, a diachronic (relating to phenomena such as ideas, language, or culture, as they occur or change over a period of time) depiction of both the production and consumption of food. Pears can be seen on the white cloth in front of the upright sitting woman who eats bread and cheese while a figure in the tree to the far right picks pears. The painting shows a large number of activities representative of the 16th-century Belgian rural life. For example, on the far right a person is shaking apples from the tree.

The Northern Renaissance work is one of a series of works, five of which still survive, that depict different times of the year. The painting is in the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, Austria. This scene is set in the depths of winter during December/January.\r The Hunters in the Snow, and the series to which it belongs, are in the medieval and early Renaissance tradition of the Labours of the Months: depictions of various rural activities and work understood by a spectator in Breugel's time as representing the different months or times of the year.\r The painting shows a wintry scene in which three hunters are returning from an expedition accompanied by their dogs. By appearances the outing was not successful; the hunters appear to trudge wearily, and the dogs appear downtrodden and miserable. One man carries the \"meager corpse of a fox\" illustrating the paucity of the hunt. In front of the hunters in the snow are the footprints of a rabbit or hare - which has escaped or been missed by the hunters. The overall visual impression is one of a calm, cold, overcast day; the colors are muted whites and grays, the trees are bare of leaves, and wood smoke hangs in the air. Several adults and a child prepare food at an inn with an outside fire. Of interest are the jagged mountain peaks which do not exist in Belgium or Holland.\r The landscape itself is a flat-bottomed valley (a river meanders through it) with jagged peaks visible on the far side. A watermill is seen with its wheel frozen stiff. In the distance, figures ice skate, play hockey with modern style sticks and curl on a frozen lake; they are rendered as silhouettes.\r The 1560s was a time of religious revolution in the Netherlands, and Bruegel (and possibly his patron) may be attempting to portray an ideal of what country life used to be or what they wish it to be.\r Writing in the \"opinion\" section of Nature, art historian Martin Kemp points out that Old Masters are popular subjects for Christmas cards and states that \"probably no 'secular' subject is more popular than ... Hunters in the Snow\".\r Hunters in the Snow is used extensively in Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky's films Solaris (1972) and The Mirror (1974), and in Lars von Trier's 2011 film Melancholia. It appears also in Alain Tanner's film Dans la ville blanche (1983). It was an inspiration for Roy Andersson's 2014 film A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence, and it is the basis for the first frame of Abbas Kiarostami's 24 Frames (2017).\r The surviving Months of the Year cycle are:\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: Christ and the Woman taken in Adultery\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,grisaille,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/christ-and-the-woman-taken-in-adultery-1565-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nChrist and the Woman Taken in Adultery is a small panel painting in grisaille (near monochrome) by the Netherlandish Renaissance printmaker and painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder. It is signed and dated 1565.\r Jesus and the woman taken in adultery is a biblical episode from John 7:53-8:11 where Jesus encounters an adulteress brought before Pharisees and scribes, which has been depicted by many artists. Such a crime was punishable by death by stoning, however, in the scene, Jesus stoops to write (in Dutch) \"he that is without sin among you, let him first cast the stone at her\" on the ground before her feet. A number of the unthrown stones lay on the floor to the left of the woman.\r Bruegel depicts the woman as one of the few graceful figures in the scene. She is rendered as an idealised form, atypical of Brugel's usual earthy and homely female figures; though the basic layout of the composition is Netherlandish, \"the austere composition and monumental figures are perhaps the most Italianate in all Bruegel's paintings\". Apart from an even smaller Three Soldiers in the Frick Collection, Bruegel's only other surviving grisaille painting is the Death of the Virgin at Upton House, Warwickshire, which is also an unusually conventional treatment of a religious subject by Bruegel's standards. However, the earliest documented work by Bruegel was grisaille wings for an altarpiece in 1550/51, as he finished his apprenticeship. This was in Mechelen, where he is documented between September 1550 and October 1551 assisting Peeter Baltens on an altarpiece (now lost), painting the wings.\r The painting was not sold by the artist, and seems to be the only one inherited by his son Jan Brueghel the Elder. An engraving was published in 1579 by Paul Perret, who was apparently lent the painting for the purpose, since there are regular pricks along the edges to enable a grid to be made. There are a number of other copies, some attributed to the artist's sons, perhaps made after the engraving, and the painting was lent to Cardinal Federico Borromeo for copying (perhaps the version now in Bergamo). A version attributed to Breuegel's son Pieter Brueghel the Younger of c. 1600 is in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\r The work was sold by the family in the 17th century, apparently by Jan Brueghel the Younger, and was in England by the 18th century, being sold at Christie's in 1834 and again in 1952 when it was bought by Count Antoine Seilern, whose collection was bequeathed to the Courtauld in 1978. The work was stolen from the Courtauld Gallery on 2 February 1982. Because of its value and fame, it proved unsaleable on the open market, and did not resurface again until 1992 when it was recovered by British police.

It is one of the first paintings in western art to feature a significant snow landscape and was painted in the aftermath of the winter of 1565, which was one of the harshest winters on record.\r The painting shows a Flemish village in winter at sundown. A group of people is gathered at a building on the left. A sign bearing the Habsburg double-headed eagle is visible on the building. Other people are making their way to the same building, including the figures of Joseph and the pregnant Virgin Mary on a donkey. A pig is being slaughtered.

To the right, a man in a small hut is shown holding a clapper, a warning to keep away from leprosy. Leprosy was endemic in that part of Europe when the painting was created. There is a begging bowl in front of the hut. As he often did, Bruegel treats a biblical story as a contemporary event. And once again, reference to particular political events has been adduced - in this case, the severity of the Spanish administration in the southern Netherlands. However, Bruegel may well be making a more general criticism of bureaucratic methods.\r The events depicted are described in Luke 2, 1-5:\r This is a rare subject in previous Netherlandish art.

The work translates the Biblical account of the Massacre of the Innocents into a winter scene in the Netherlands in the prelude to the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule, also known as the Eighty Years' War.\r What is now thought to be the only version by Bruegel the Elder (c.1565-67) is in the British Royal Collection; for some time held at Hampton Court Palace, by 2017 it was at Windsor Castle. Many versions are attributed to Pieter Breughel the Younger, with different art historians listing as many as 7 or 14 versions, including leading examples in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels, and in the National Museum of Art of Romania in Bucharest. Pieter Breughel the Younger also painted his own different composition of the Massacre of the Innocents: one example is held by the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium.\r The painting depicts an event described in the Gospel of Saint Matthew 2:16-18 in the New Testament of the Bible: after King Herod was told by the Magi of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, he ordered his soldiers to kill all of the infant children in Bethlehem below the age of 2 years. (In the Biblical account, an angel warned Jesus's family, and they escaped to Egypt.) The Massacre of the Innocents is commemorated on 28 December in the Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican church calendars, as the fourth day of Christmastide.\r Bruegel translated the scene to a 16th-century Netherlandish village, where the Flemish villagers are attacked by Spanish soldiers and German mercenaries, possibly as a commentary on the behaviour of occupying Spanish troops in the prelude to the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule, also known as the Eighty Years' War. The very severe winter of 1564-5 may have inspired the snow-covered scene, with icicles hanging from the eaves and a pond covered with a thick layer of ice: the deep winter also inspired his 1565 painting The Hunters in the Snow.\r The version by Bruegel the Elder in the Royal Collection was acquired by Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph II, and was in Prague by about 1600. He disliked the graphic scene, which depicted many infants being slaughtered by soldiers carrying his own imperial heraldry of the double-headed eagle, and had the children painted over with details \u2013 small objects including food and animals \u2013 so that it became a scene of plunder not a massacre of babies. The later overpainting became apparent during conservation work in 1998, and Lorne Campbell identified the painting in the Royal Collection as the original version by Bruegel the Elder. This version was probably one of many paintings from the imperial collection looted from Prague Castle by a Swedish army in 1648, at the end of the Thirty Years' War: it was in the collection of Queen Christina by 1652, and came into the British Royal Collection when it was acquired by Charles II in exile at Breda in 1660.

Owned by the museum of the Detroit Institute of Arts in Detroit, Michigan, the work was discovered by its director in England in 1930, and brought to Detroit. It is believed to be one of a set of three Bruegel works from around the same time, The Wedding Dance, The Peasant Wedding (1567) and The Peasant Dance (1569).\r The painting depicts 125 wedding guests. As was customary in the Renaissance period, the brides wore black and men wore codpieces. Voyeurism is depicted throughout the entire art work; dancing was disapproved of by the authorities and the church, and the painting can be seen as both a critique and comic depiction of a stereotypical oversexed, overindulgent, peasant class of the times.\r Pieter Bruegel the Elder completed The Wedding Dance in 1566. It is believed to have been lost for many years, until discovered at a sale in London in 1930 by William R. Valentiner, the director of the Museum Detroit Institute of Arts at the time. Valentiner paid $35,075 for The Wedding Dance through a city appropriation. It is still owned by the museum.\r The Peasant Wedding (1567) and The Peasant Dance (1569) are also by Bruegel which share the same wedding theme and elements and were painted in the same period in Bruegel's later years. They are considered to be a trilogy of works by Bruegel. In all three of the paintings, there are pipers playing the pijpzak (bagpipes), they also exude pride and vanity, for example in The Peasant Dance the man seated next to the pijpzak player is wearing a peacock feather in his hat.\r Robert L. Bonn, an author, described these trilogy of works as \"superb examples\" of anthropological paintings, and states that \"in three genre paintings Bruegel stands in marked contrast both to painters of his day and many others who followed.\" Thomas Craven summarises The Wedding Dance as \"One of several celebrations of the joys of gluttony painted by Brueghel with bursting vitality\". Walter S. Gibson, an art historian, also views the paintings as a \"sermon condemning gluttony\" and \"an allegory of the Church abandoned by Christ.\"\r The popular painting shows a group of 125 wedding guests wearing clothing from the times, presented in the canvas in an apparently chaotic way in an outdoor party surrounded by trees. The brides wore black as it was the Renaissance period and the men wore codpieces, which were an important part of their clothing at the time. Voyeurism (spying on people engaged in intimate behaviours) is shown throughout the entire work amongst almost all of the people.\r Each guest's positioning in the painting has its own meaning. In the foreground there is a dancer wearing the colours of that time period and there are many peasants in that area. In the middle there is the bride dancing with an older man, her father. On the right of the work, there is a musician playing on a pijpzak, who is watching the dance from the side. Judging by the writing utensils hanging on his belt, he is a writer or possibly a middle-class painter. Behind him is a hanging tablecloth decorated with a crown and beneath it is the bride's table. Before her table, money collectors can be seen digging trenches while the wedding guests sit down and eat.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: Conversion of St. Paul\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/conversion-of-st-paul-1567\n\nWikipedia Article:\nConversion of Paul is an oil-on-panel by the Netherlandish Renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, painted in 1567.

The saint himself is in a blue doublet and hose of the painter's day. Bruegel, having lived in Italy, was not unfamiliar with classical dress: his intention in representing biblical scenes in contemporary dress was to stress their relevance to his own time. In view of the persecution and counter-persecution of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, the story of Paul's conversion had special significance. The events are described in The Acts of the Apostles 9, 3-7:\r Bruegel is not only illustrating the biblical text; he is also stressing the need for faith and condemning the sin of pride.\r This work was acquired by Archduke Ernest of Austria in 1594, subsequently passing into the imperial collections with Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor. Some critics have suggested that the scene depicted by Bruegel refers to contemporaneous events, especially the crossing of the Alps by Don Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo y Pimentel, 3rd Duke of Alba in 1567, as he was marching into the Netherlands at the head of an army of 10,000 men to sedate the Dutch revolts.\r More probably, Bruegel's depiction of Paul's conversion taking place high up on a pine-clad mountain pass may have been suggested by an engraving of 1509 by Lucas van Leyden. As in The Procession to Calvary and the Preaching of John the Baptist, Bruegel places the principal figures in the middle distance, almost lost amongst a mass of small figures and behind the eye-catching foreground soldiers and horsemen, who are incidental to the telling of the story. This is a familiar mannerist device which is intended to tease the spectator and draw his eye deep into the picture space in search of the principal subject.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: Land of Cockaigne\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/land-of-cockaigne-1567\n\nWikipedia Article:\nHet Luilekkerland (Dutch, \"the lazy-luscious-land\") \u2014 known in English as The Land of Cockaigne \u2014 is a 1567 oil painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (c. 1525\u20131569). In medieval times, Cockaigne was a mythical land of plenty, but Bruegel's depiction of Cockaigne and its residents is not meant to be a flattering one. He chooses rather a comic illustration of the spiritual emptiness believed to derive from gluttony and sloth, two of the seven deadly sins.\r In the painting, a clerk, a peasant, and a soldier lie dozing on the ground underneath a table bound to a tree. The clerk's book, papers, ink and pen lie idle, as do the peasant's flail and the soldier's lance and gauntlet. A half-eaten egg in its shell runs between the peasant and the clerk. The table attached to the tree is laden with partly consumed food and drink. Behind the tree, a roasted fowl lays itself upon a silver platter, implying that it is ready to be eaten, and a roasted pig runs about with a carving knife already slipped under its skin. On the left, a knight emerges from a lean-to whose roof is covered in dishes of pie and pastry, with an open mouth, waiting for a roasted pigeon to fly in (the pigeon was accidentally removed during restoration work). On the right and behind the main action, a man clutching a spoon forces his way out of a large cloud of pudding, having eaten his way through it; he reaches for the bent branch of a tree in order to lower himself into Cockaigne. The fence enclosing the main scene behind the dozing trio is made of interwoven sausages. A partly eaten wheel of cheese and a bush (or tower) of loaves of bread are on the left and right of the scene, respectively.\r The arrangement of the clerk, peasant, and soldier underneath the tree suggests the men as the spokes of a wheel, where the tree is the hub. The roasted fowl lies in the place where a fourth spoke could be.\r Ross Frank has argued that the painting is a political satire directed at the participants in the first stages of the Dutch Revolt (1568\u20131648), where the roasted fowl represents the humiliation and failure of the nobleman (who would otherwise form the fourth spoke of the wheel) in his leadership of the Netherlands, and the overall scene depicts the complacency of the Netherlandish people, too content with their abundance to take the risks that would bring about significant religious and political change.\r The painting has also been cited as illustrating the Freudian oral stage of psychosexual development, showing a paradise of oral pleasure. It is used to demonstrate how human beings achieve oral pleasure and stimulation from eating and simply having things in the mouth.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: The Peasant Dance\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/the-peasant-dance-1568\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Peasant Dance is an oil-on-panel by the Netherlandish Renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, painted in c. 1569. It was looted by Napoleon Bonaparte and brought to Paris in 1808, being returned in 1815. Today it is held by and exhibited at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.\r The panel, neither signed nor dated, was painted circa 1567, at about the same time as The Peasant Wedding. The paintings are the same size and may have been intended as a pair or as part of a series illustrating peasant life. They are the two most outstanding examples of Bruegel's late style, which is characterized by his use of monumental Italianate figures.\r Like The Peasant Wedding, it is likely that Bruegel intended this painting to have a moral sense rather than simply being an affectionate portrayal of peasant life. Gluttony, lust and anger can all be identified in the picture. The man seated next to the bagpipe player wears a peacock feather in his hat, a symbol of vanity and pride. The occasion for the peasants' revelry is a Saint's day, but dancers turn their backs on the church and pay no attention whatsoever to the image of the Virgin which hangs on the tree. The prominence of the tavern makes it clear that they are preoccupied with material rather than spiritual matters.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: The Wine of Saint Martin's Day\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/the-wine-of-saint-martin-s-day-1568\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Wine of Saint Martin's Day is the largest painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. It is currently held in the Museo del Prado, Madrid, where it was identified as a Breugel original in 2010. Like much of Bruegel's work it depicts peasant life, in this case a festival known as St. Martin's Day, which involves drinking the first wine of the season.\r The picture depicts a popular festival celebrated on 11 November. Although it is not a religious painting as such, it contains references to Christianity. There is a roadside cross, which the peasants seemingly ignore, and among the many figures is a group which alludes to the legend of St Martin of Tours dividing his cloak to share it with a beggar. This idea of having an important theme relegated to the side of the painting is paralleled in, for example, Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, which also highlights ordinary events.\r The picture has been dated on stylistic grounds to the 1560s. It is one of several surviving works by this artist executed in glue-size on linen (T\u00fcchlein). By the early twenty-first century, when its owners took it to the Prado for restoration, the painting was not in a good state of conservation . This is not surprising as the fragile medium tends to cause conservation problems. (On the other hand, The Blind Leading the Blind, one of the other Bruegels in this medium, is in relatively good condition). After restoration, the painting was put on public display in the Prado.\r The work was identified as a Bruegel in 2010 at the Museo del Prado in Madrid. A study of the surface using X-rays revealed fragments of Bruegel's signature, thereby confirming his authorship. It was subsequently acquired by the Prado for less than its value on the open market.\r The Wine of Saint Martin's Day matches the description of a painting which was inventoried in the collection of the Gonzaga dukes of Mantua in the early seventeenth century. However, there is some doubt as to whether the painting in Mantua was the painting now in the Prado. It might, for example, have been a related painting now in Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum, which shows the group around St Martin. The earliest documentary evidence which definitely relates to the work now in the Prado Museum is an inventory of the collection of a Spanish aristocrat, Luis Francisco de la Cerda, the ninth duke of Medinaceli. The inventory was drawn up after the duke's death in the early eighteenth century: he is assumed to have acquired the painting in Italy around the end of the seventeenth century.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: Misanthrope\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/misanthrope-1568\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Misanthrope is a tempera painting on canvas by the Flemish Renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, created during 1568. It currently is held and exhibited at the National Museum of Capodimonte in Naples, Italy.\r The circular painting is encased in a square frame and depicts a black-robed, white-bearded elderly man clasping his hands before him. A smaller barefooted man behind him uses a knife to cut the strings to the elderly man's moneypouch. The elderly man appears so lost in thought that he notices neither the theft nor the thorns that lie in his path. A transparent sphere with a cross at its peak encloses the thief A Flemish inscription at the bottom reads:\r The moral suggested by the painting is that such a relinquishment of the world is not possible: one must face up to the world's difficulties, not abandon responsibility for them.\r The hooded misanthrope is being robbed by the small figure in the glass ball who is holding his purse. That figure is a symbol of vanity. The symbolism in the painting portrays how impossible it is for his actions to lead to giving up the world. The misanthrope also is walking unaware toward caltrops set for him by the world (cast in his path). He cannot renounce the world as he would wish and he is contrasted with the shepherd in the background, who guards his sheep and who is more virtuous than the misanthrope because of his simple, honourable performance of his duties and his sense of responsibility toward his charges.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: Parable of the Blind\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/parable-of-the-blind-1568\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Blind Leading the Blind, Blind, or The Parable of the Blind (Dutch: De parabel der blinden) is a painting by the Netherlandish Renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, completed in 1568. Executed in distemper on linen canvas, it measures 86\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a0154\u00a0cm (34\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a061\u00a0in). It depicts the Biblical parable of the blind leading the blind from the Gospel of Matthew 15:14, and is in the collection of the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples, Italy.\r The painting reflects Bruegel's mastery of observation. Each figure has a different eye affliction, including corneal leukoma, atrophy of globe and removed eyes. The men hold their heads aloft to make better use of their other senses. The diagonal composition reinforces the off-kilter motion of the six figures falling in progression. It is considered a masterwork for its accurate detail and composition. Copies include a larger version by Bruegel's son Pieter Brueghel the Younger, and the work has inspired literature such as poetry by Charles Baudelaire and William Carlos Williams, and a novel by Gert Hofmann.\r Bruegel painted The Blind the year before his death. It has a bitter, sorrowful tone, which may be related to the establishment of the Council of Troubles in 1567 by the government of the Spanish Netherlands. The council ordered mass arrests and executions to enforce Spanish rule and suppress Protestantism. The placement of Sint-Anna Church of the village Sint-Anna-Pede has led to both pro- and anti-Catholic interpretations, though it is not clear that the painting was meant as a political statement.\r The painting depicts a procession of six blind, disfigured men. They pass along a path bordered by a river on one side and a village with a church on the other. The leader of the group has fallen on his back into a ditch and, because they are all linked by their staffs, seems about to drag his companions down with him. A cowherd stands in the background.\r Bruegel based the work on the Biblical parable of the blind leading the blind from Matthew 15:14, in which Christ refers to the Pharisees. According to art critic Margaret Sullivan, Bruegel's audience was likely as familiar with classical literature as with the Bible. Erasmus had published his Adagia two years before Bruegel's painting, and it contained the quotation \"Caecus caeco dux\" (\"the blind leader of the blind\") by Roman poet Horace. Bruegel expands the two blind men in the parable to six; they are well dressed, rather than wearing the peasant clothing that typifies his late work. The first blind man's face is not visible; the second twists his head as he falls, perhaps to avoid landing face-first. The shinguard-clad third man, on his toes with knees bent and face to the sky, shares a staff with the second, by which he is being pulled down. The others have yet to stumble, but the same fate seems implied.\r The faces and bodies of the blind men, and background detail including the church, are rendered in exceptionally fine detail. The backward-falling posture of the guide demonstrates Bruegel's mastery of foreshortening. Bruegel's settings tend to be fictional, but that of The Blind Leading the Blind has been identified as the village Sint-Anna-Pede, and the church as Sint-Anna Church.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: The Peasant and the Birdnester\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/peasant-and-birdnester-1568\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Peasant and the Nest Robber (also The Peasant and the Birdnester) is an oil-on-panel painting by the Netherlandish Renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, painted in 1568.

Painted the year before the artist's death, this painting, like other late works such as The Land of Cockaigne, The Peasant Dance, and The Peasant Wedding, is dominated by monumental figures. Immediately after his return from Italy, Bruegel showed no apparent interest in Italian figure types and compositions, reverting to the Antwerp tradition in which he had been trained. However, in these late works he shows that his study of Italian painting had taken root: these figures demonstrate his knowledge of Italian art and in particular the art of Michelangelo.\r This unusual subject apparently illustrates a Netherlandish proverb:\r The painting presents a moralising contrast between the active, wicked individual and the passive man who is virtuous in spite of adversity (a similar theme appears in his drawing The Beekeepers) And lastly it could be suggested that the pointing man is making judgement on the robber whilst not aware that he is nearly stepping into the water in front of him.\r It has been suggested that, with his knowledge of Italian art, Bruegel intended the peasant's gesture as a profane parody of the gesture of Leonardo's St John .\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: Peasant Wedding\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/peasant-wedding-1568\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Peasant Wedding is a 1567 genre painting by the Flemish Renaissance painter and printmaker Pieter Bruegel the Elder, one of his many depicting peasant life. It is currently housed in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. Pieter Bruegel the Elder enjoyed painting peasants and different aspects of their lives in so many of his paintings that he has been called Peasant-Bruegel, but he was in fact a sophisticated intellectual, and many of his paintings have a symbolic meaning and also a moral aspect.\r The bride is in front of the green textile wall-hanging, with a paper-crown hung above her head. She is also wearing a crown on her head, and she is sitting passively, not participating in the eating or drinking taking place around her. The Bridegroom is not in attendance of the wedding feast in accordance to Flemish custom. The feast is in a barn in the summertime; two sheaves of grain with a rake recalls the work that harvesting involves, and the hard life peasants have. The plates are carried on a door off its hinges. The main food was bread, porridge and soup. Other features of the scene include two pipers playing the pijpzak, an unbreeched boy in the foreground licking a plate, the wealthy man at the far right feeding a dog by putting bread on the bench, and a mysterious extra foot seen under the load of dishes being carried by the two men in the right foreground. The scene is claimed to depict an accurate portrayal of the 16th-century way of celebrating a peasant wedding.\r There has been much conjecture as to the identity of the groom in this painting. Gilbert Highet has argued that the groom is the man in the centre of the painting, wearing a dark coat and seen in profile, or the ill-bred son of a wealthy couple, seen against the far wall, to the right of the bride, eating with a spoon, same as Gustav Gl\u00fcck. It has also been suggested that according to contemporary custom, the groom is not seated at the table but may be the man pouring out beer. Or he may be according to the same custom serving the food instead. According to this theory, the groom is the young man wearing a red cap, who is serving his guests the food, handing out plates to his guests.\r In a Freudian vein, Rudy Rucker speculates:\r Some authors have even suggested that the groom is not even included in the painting. Van der Elst speculated that this could be the depiction of an old Flemish proverb, like some of \"There is an old Flemish proverb: 'It is a poor man who is not able to be at his own wedding.' That seems to be the case here.\" Some argued that it is a presentation of the mystical Wedding of Cana. Lindsay and Bernard Hupp\u00e9 speculated that the painting was a Christian allegory, symbolizing corruption, depicting the corrupted Church, which was supposed to be the bride of Christ, but the groom has not appeared to claim his corrupt bride.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: The Beggars\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/the-beggars-1568\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Beggars or The Cripples is an oil-on-panel by the Netherlandish Renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, painted in 1568. It is now in the Louvre in Paris.\r This work is the only painting by Bruegel in the Louvre, received as a gift in 1892.\r Attempts have been made to interpret the picture of six cripples and a beggar-woman as an allusion to a historical event: the badger's tails, or foxes' tails, on their clothes might refer to the Gueux, a rebel party formed against the government of Philip II of Spain and Granvelle; but these also occur in Bruegel's The Fight Between Carnival and Lent in Vienna, dated 1559. Still, the beggars are not quite ordinary beggars, as they wear carnival headgear representing various classes of society: a cardboard crown (the king), a paper shako (the soldier), a beret (the bourgeois), a cap (the peasant), and a mitre (the bishop). The work clearly has some satirical meaning, which has so far eluded interpretation. Perhaps physical imperfections are meant to symbolise moral decrepitude, which can affect all men irrespective of class.\r On the back of the painting are two inscriptions which seem to date from the 16th century. One is in Flemish, and in a very fragmentary state; the other is in Latin and records the admiration some humanist felt for Bruegel, whose art surpasses Nature itself.\r The painting dates from the end of Bruegel's career, when he showed a keener interest in the natural world. Tiny though it is, the landscape seen through the opening is bathed in a delicate light which simmers like dew on the foliage.\r On the back of the painting is written:\r Modern eyes may be inclined to conclude that Brugel intended to invoke sympathy for the plight of the crippled figures, but from a historical perspective this is unlikely. Europeans of Bruegel's time gave little regard to beggars, and the painting provides hints that Bruegel shared this denigration: the figures are outside the town walls and are posed in such ways as to provoke contempt and amusement. The foxtail on some of the figures was a symbol at the time of ridicule in political caricature and real life. The woman behind them bears an empty bowl and may appear to be ignoring the beggars.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: The Magpie on the Gallows\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/the-magpie-on-the-gallows-1568\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Magpie on the Gallows (German: Die Elster auf dem Galgen) is a 1568 oil-on-wood panel painting by the Netherlandish Renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder.\r The painting shows a woodland clearing containing three peasants dancing to a bagpipes, next to a gallows upon which a magpie is perched. The gallows stands in the centre of the picture, dividing the painting in two, a Mannerist composition with the right side more \"open\" and left more \"closed\", with the magpie close to the exact centre of the painting. The gallows appears to form an \"impossible object\", similar to a Penrose triangle, with the bases of the posts seemingly planted side by side, but with the right side of the cross-member receding into the distance, and contradictory lighting.\r Another magpie sits on a rock at the base of the gallows, near the skull of an animal. The only people occupy the left foreground: a man defecates in the shadows to the left, while others watch the three dancers. To the right stands a cross with a watermill behind. The background opens on to a view of a river valley, with a town to the left and castle on a rocky crag above, and a tower on a rock outcrop to the right, and distant hills and the sky beyond. Behind the dancers rise two intertwined trees, a motif used by Bruegel in an earlier drawing of bears playing in a forest. An impression of depth is given by the progression from dense brown tones dominating of the foreground, through green midtones in the middle distance, to light blues and greys for the background.\r Bruegel's painting was created the year after Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, arrived in the Netherlands, sent by the Spanish king, Philip II to suppress the Dutch Revolt. The gallows may represent the threat of execution of those preaching the new Protestant doctrine, and the painting may allude to several Netherlandish proverbs. There is a direct allusion to the Netherlandish proverbs of dancing on the gallows or shitting on the gallows, meaning a mocking of the state. It also alludes to the belief that magpies are gossips, and that gossip leads to hangings. And that the way to the gallows leads through pleasant meadows.\r It is not known why or for whom the picture was painted. Its date of 1568 makes this painting one of Bruegel's last works before his death in 1569; indeed, perhaps his final work. Bruegel asked his wife to burn some of his pictures on his death, but told her to keep the Magpie on the Gallows for herself. It is now held by the Hessisches Landesmuseum in Darmstadt.\r  Media related to The Magpie on the Gallows at Wikimedia Commons\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Bruegel the Elder\nArtwork Name: The Storm at Sea\nArtwork Genre: marina\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/the-storm-at-sea-1569\n\nWikipedia Article:\nStorm at Sea is an oil-on-panel by the Netherlandish Renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, painted in c. 1569.

However, not only is this painting superior to any by de Momper; its similarity to a drawing by Bruegel and its originality of composition and delicacy of execution have made it generally accepted as a late work by Bruegel, possibly left unfinished at his death.\r The preminance of the barrel and the whale has led the painting to be associated with the contemporary saying:\r This sense would be underscored by the church outlined against the horizon, which stands for safety amid the storms of life.\n", "\nArtist: Adam Elsheimer\nArtwork Name: The Rest on the Flight into Egypt\nArtwork Genre: cloudscape,religious painting\nArtwork Media: copper,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/adam-elsheimer/the-rest-on-the-flight-into-egypt-1609\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Flight into Egypt is an oil-on-copper cabinet painting by the German artist Adam Elsheimer dating from about 1609, while he was in Rome. It is thought to be the first naturalistic rendering of the night sky in Renaissance art. At Elsheimer's death in Rome in 1610, this picture was hanging in his bedroom.Like many other artists before and after him, Elsheimer has depicted the biblical Flight into Egypt, in which Joseph, Mary, and Jesus seek refuge from possible persecution by Herod.  For its innovative fusing of religious and landscape elements, and its detailed juxtaposition of light and darkness, The Flight into Egypt is one of Elsheimer's most well-known and lauded works. It is also likely his last painting, for he died a year later.  Elsheimer's treatment is unique in placing the Holy Family in a nocturnal setting, true to the biblical description. The darkness creates opposing feelings of intimacy and fear of the unknown. The painting channels the mysteries of night, pondered by humans for centuries, into this moment of the Holy Family seeking refuge.  There are four sources of light in the painting: the Moon is accurately depicted and reflects off the calm water. There is a fire near the shepherds at left, where the family is headed. At the centre of the composition, Joseph holds a torch that illuminates Mary and the infant, who are riding an ass.  The heavily treed landscape behind them is almost black, its outline forming a diagonal across the sky and completely containing the foreground figures. The diagonal is echoed in the night sky by the intricate band of the Milky Way, and detailed configurations of stars are seen, including Ursa Major at far left. Elsheimer is thought to be the first painter to accurately depict constellations. Another readily identifiable constellation is Leo, above the Holy Family, with its brightest star, Regulus, in the centre of the picture. It has been proposed that Elsheimer reworked the painting in 1610, after the publication of Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius, which showed the Milky Way as composed of individual stars and showed the Moon's surface in unprecedented detail. This hypothesis has been contested by Elsheimer scholar Keith Andrews.  In addition to disclosing Elsheimer's interest in scientific topics, the appearance of the Milky Way has a spiritual connotation\u2014it symbolized the path to heaven beginning in the Middle Ages. Elsheimer's sky, wrote art historian R.H. Wilenski, \"is no longer a blackcloth but a symbol for boundless space\".  Elsheimer's inventory shows the painting to have been located in his bedroom. The importance of Elsheimer's painting can be judged from a letter dated 14 January 1611 from Rubens to the doctor, botanist and art collector Johann Faber in which he discusses the extraordinary price of 300 scudi demanded by the widow. The painting eventually passed to Hendrick Goudt, who took it to Utrecht.  Elsheimer's works, including The Flight into Egypt, influenced important near-contemporaries Claude Lorrain and Peter Paul Rubens. Rembrandt's version of The Flight into Egypt (1627), with its unique illumination, may have been inspired by Elsheimer's. Rembrandt would have been familiar with Elsheimer's work through high-quality engravings made by  his friend Hendrick Goudt. The influence of Goudt's prints on the work of other engravers, especially that of Jan van de Velde, was immediate.\n", "\nArtist: Frans Hals\nArtwork Name: Shrovetide Revellers (The Merry Company)\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/shrovetide-revellers-the-merry-company\n\nWikipedia Article:\nShrovetide Revellers is a painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Frans Hals, painted in 1615 and now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. The painting shows people enjoying festivities at Shrovetide (Dutch: Carnaval).\r The painting shows the face of an elegantly dressed smiling woman raising her right finger to make a point, while a man with a string of wurst around his neck grabs her shoulder to whisper in her ear. Another amused gentlemen leans on his shoulder and listens to their banter. Some claim these are the Baroque theatre characters Hans Wurst and Peeckelhaeringh. Behind them other people are talking and laughing.\r The painting was first documented by Wilhelm von Bode in 1883, and after that was included in most catalogs of Hals' works, including by Ernst Wilhelm Moes in 1909, Hofstede de Groot in 1910, by W.R. Valentiner in 1923, and by Gerrit David Gratama in 1946. The MET lists an Amsterdam sale entry from 1765 mentioning a genre work of Vasten-Avond, or Shrovetide, and Slive mentions a period drawing by Mathys van den Bergh.\r The female wears much more brightly colored clothing than any of Hals other sitters, and shows a strong resemblance to the young woman portrayed in Hals' Yonker Ramp and His Sweetheart. Both are considered to be genre works today, so the models could be anyone in Hals circle such as his children or pupils. In his 1989 catalog of the international Frans Hals exhibition, Slive included a full color photo of this work to demonstrate Hals' \"love of life\". The painting itself could not be included in the exhibition because it can never be lent out. It is interesting to note that in the same year that Slive was writing his exhibition catalog, Claus Grimm rejected the attribution of this painting to Frans Hals, though he conceded it was probably after a painting by Hals, calling it a copy of a lost original.\r Hals' positioning of the figures are related to two other known paintings:\n", "\nArtist: Frans Hals\nArtwork Name: A Banquet of the Officers of the St. George Militia Company\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/a-banquet-of-the-officers-of-the-st-george-militia-company-1616\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1616 refers to the first of several large schutterstukken painted by Frans Hals for the St. George (or St. Joris) civic guard of Haarlem, and today is considered one of the main attractions of the Frans Hals Museum there.\r Hals was in his thirties when he painted this piece, and was far from established as a portrait painter. To be safe, he based most of his design on the painting of his predecessor, Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem, who painted the same militia company in 1599.\r Given a nearly impossible task, namely to complete his assignment but to add theatrical elements at the same time, Hals must have spent lots of time judging the politics of the group. He knew these men well as he served in the St. Joris militia himself from 1612-1615. In his painting, he indicates the political position of each man in the group as well as managing to give each a characteristic portrait. In Cornelis van Haarlem's piece the figures seem crammed into a tight space, and each face seems to have a similar expression. In Hals' group, an illusion of space and relaxed conversation is given.\r Officers were selected by the council of Haarlem to serve for three years, and this group had just finished their tenure and celebrated their end of service with a portrait. The man with the orange sash heads the table and the second in command is on his right.

Hals was in his thirties when he painted this piece, and was far from established as a portrait painter. To be safe, he based most of his design on the painting of his predecessor, Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem, who painted the same militia company in 1599.   Given a nearly impossible task, namely to complete his assignment but to add theatrical elements at the same time, Hals must have spent lots of time judging the politics of the group. He knew these men well as he served in the St. Joris militia himself from 1612\u20131615. In his painting, he indicates the political position of each man in the group as well as managing to give each a characteristic portrait. In Cornelis van Haarlem's piece the figures seem crammed into a tight space, and each face seems to have a similar expression. In Hals' group, an illusion of space and relaxed conversation is given.  Officers were selected by the council of Haarlem to serve for three years, and this group had just finished their tenure and celebrated their end of service with a portrait.

It is considered the best of several versions of a Rommelpot player by Frans Hals.\r Fifteen versions of this painting were documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote: \"The Rommelpot- Player. In the centre is a man turned three-quarters left. He faces the spectator and laughs heartily. He is in dark clothes with a broad brimmed felt hat. His left forearm encircles the rommelpot (or bagpipes)\u00a0; in his right hand is a little stick with which he plays on it. Six laughing children surround him. The biggest boy, behind him to the right, claps his hands with delight. The other five children are to the left. Four of them are placed so that their heads make a diagonal line down to the left. The second boy from the top has a slouch hat. The fifth child, a girl, stands to the left behind this boy. In the background peasants look in at a door.\r Variants of this composition exist. Thus, the girl on the extreme left looks at the spectator and not up at the player in the picture of the Paul Giersberg sale. Another time, the girl is replaced by a boy who looks up at the player in the picture of the Paul Mersch sale while the second child from the bottom, a little girl, who usually looks up at the player, is facing the spectator.\r A recognised original of this composition cannot now be traced. There are a number of replicas which at best date from the time of Frans Hals, while some perhaps come from his studio.

In the collection of Baron Gustave de Rothschild, Paris..\"\r The theme of a lute player painted at half length originated in Italy, and the Dutch painter Dirck van Baburen first introduced this theme in the Northern Netherlands with his lute player of 1622. Baburen's player is pointing his lute towards the viewer with his mouth open in song. Hals' player is looking up and smiling naturally, as if he is playing with a singer or another musician not in view. This painting is a good example of Hals' \"rough style\" of painting with loose brush strokes.\r A period copy now in the collection of the Rijksmuseum has been dated before 1626 based on an engraving, and it has been attributed variously to Hals, his brother Dirk, and Judith Leyster.\r Two other paintings of lute players by Hals are:\r Hals was not the only painter to be influenced by Baburen. Hendrik ter Brugghen painted several lute players in the 1620s, and a few of them seem to merge aspects of Baburen and Hals, though his later version seems to follow Hals more closely.\r This painting has been copied by other artists, most notably by David Bailly in his 1651 self-portrait with his artist's influences, and by Adriaan de Lelie with his 1813 self-portrait with Josephus Augustinus Brentano, including this painting on the wall of Brentano's collection. Aspects of the painting have also been copied, such as the pose of the hands and the upward smiling face, such as Jan Steen's self-portrait as a smiling lute player.\r The painting was purchased by Gustave de Rothschild (1829\u20131911) in 1873 and remained in the family over a century until 1984.\n", "\nArtist: Frans Hals\nArtwork Name: The Laughing Cavalier\nArtwork Genre: portrait,tronie\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/the-laughing-cavalier-1624\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Laughing Cavalier (1624) is a portrait by the Dutch Golden Age painter Frans Hals in the Wallace Collection in London, which has been described as \"one of the most brilliant of all Baroque portraits\". The title is an invention of the Victorian public and press, dating from its exhibition in the opening display at the Bethnal Green Museum in 1872\u201375, just after its arrival in England, after which it was regularly reproduced as a print, and became among of the best known old master paintings in Britain. The unknown subject is in fact not laughing, but can be said to have an enigmatic smile, much amplified by his upturned moustache.\r The portrait measures 83 \u00d7 67.3\u00a0cm (32.7 \u00d7 26.5 in) and is inscribed at top right \"\u00c6'TA SV\u00c6 26/A\u00b01624\", which expands to \"aetatis suae 26, anno 1624\" in Latin and means that the portrait was painted when the sitter was 26 and in the year 1624. The identity of the man is unknown, and though the recorded 19th century titles in Dutch, English and French mostly suggest a military man, or at least an officer in one of the part-time militia companies that were often the subjects of group portraits, including some by Hals and later Rembrandt's Night Watch (1642), in fact he was as likely to be a wealthy civilian. Art historian Pieter Biesboer has theorised the painting possibly depicts Dutch cloth merchant Tieleman Roosterman, the subject of another of Hals' portraits.\r The composition is lively and spontaneous, and despite the apparent labour involved in the gorgeous, and very expensive, silk costume, close inspection reveals long, quick brush strokes. The turning pose and low viewpoint are found in other portraits by Hals and here allow emphasis on the embroidered sleeve and lace cuff. There are many emblems in the embroidery: signifying \"the pleasures and pains of love\" are \"bees, arrows, flaming cornucopiae, lovers' knots and tongues of fire\", while an obelisk or pyramid signifies strength and Mercury's cap and caduceus fortune.\r In general, commissioned portraits such as this rarely showed adults smiling until the late 18th century, though smiling is often seen in tronies and figures in genre painting. But Hals is an exception to the general rule and often showed sitters with broader smiles than here, and in informal poses that bring an impression of movement and spontaneity to his work.\r The effect of the eyes appearing to follow the viewer from every angle is a result of the subject being depicted as looking directly forward, toward the artist's point of view, combined with being a static two dimensional representation of this from whichever angle the painting itself is viewed.\r The painting's provenance only goes back to a sale in The Hague in 1770; after further Dutch sales it was bought by the Franco-Swiss banker and collector the Comte de Pourtal\u00e8s-Gorgier in 1822. After his death the painting was acquired at the auction of his collection in Paris in 1865 by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford, who outbid Baron James de Rothschild at more than six times the sales estimate. It was in Hertford's Paris home in 1871, listed as portrait d'un homme (\"portrait of a man\"), and then brought to London, probably for the purpose of exhibiting it in a large and long loan exhibition of old master paintings at Bethnal Green, which was deliberately sited away from the West End of London to attract the working classes. The exhibition was a huge success and A Cavalier (the catalogue title) a particular hit with both public and the critics; it played a considerable part in raising the critical estimation of Hals in England. By 1888, when it was again exhibited at the Royal Academy, it had become Laughing Cavalier, though a cleaning in the intervening period (in 1884) may have changed the effect. The critic in the Athenaeum noted a brighter appearance, but also that \"The man smiles rather than laughs\". Hertford's collection was bequeathed to his natural son Sir Richard Wallace Bt., whose widow donated it and his London house to the nation as the Wallace Collection.\n", "\nArtist: Frans Hals\nArtwork Name: Laughing boy\nArtwork Genre: portrait,tronie\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/laughing-boy\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLaughing Boy (Dutch: Lachende jongen) is a circular oil-on-panel painting by the Dutch artist Frans Hals.

It is in the collection of the Mauritshuis.\r Another circular portrait with a laughing boy is in the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and shows a soap bubble on the right. A third version exists where the boy is grasping a whistle or flute. Several other circular portraits of laughing boys, all painted around the same period, with or without a bubble or a whistle, have been attributed to Hals in the past. Of the twenty or so paintings identified in 1974 by the Hals expert Seymour Slive, he considered only three to be authentic.\r The Hals expert Claus Grimm rejected the other two and claims only this one is authentic. In his own time, Hals' works were copied by art students. In the late 19th century young artists in the impressionist movement were impressed by the loose brush strokes and wet-in-wet painting technique of these small tondos, and it is possible that a few of the many copies on the art market today date from this later period.\r Other boys painted by Hals in round tondos:\n", "\nArtist: Frans Hals\nArtwork Name: St. Luke\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/st-luke\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSt. Luke is a painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Frans Hals, painted in 1625 and now in the Odessa Museum of Western and Eastern Art, Odessa.\r The painting shows St. Luke sitting at a desk reading with an ox at his elbow. This painting was documented in the 18th-century but was considered lost until the 1950s, when two tronies were discovered languishing in the storerooms of the Odessa Museum of Western and Eastern Art in 1958 by art historian Irina Linnik. At the time they were considered to be by unknown 19th-century painters, but Linnik recognized them as the work of a 17th-century master and eventually traced their history back to the 17th century, identifying them as two of four lost paintings by Hals of the evangelists, namely Luke and Matthew. After her work was published in 1959, the two paintings were included in the 1962 Frans Hals exhibition in the Frans Hals Museum. The international attention helped to spur art detectives and eventually the other two of John and Mark were also rediscovered.\r In his 1989 catalog of the international Frans Hals exhibition, Slive included a detail of Hals' The Banquet of the Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1627 with the head of Johan Damius to show that he was the probable model for St. Luke, though with a bit less hair.\r Damius and Luke:\r The four evangelists by Hals:\n", "\nArtist: Frans Hals\nArtwork Name: Willem Van Heythuyzen\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/willem-van-heythuyzen\n\nWikipedia Article:\nWillem van Heythuysen posing with a sword is a painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Frans Hals, painted in 1625 and now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich. It shows the Haarlem cloth merchant Willem van Heythuysen in a theatrical pose with a rapier.\r The painting shows a proud man standing in front of a neoclassical architectural element with drapery, leaning on a sword. In the distance a garden with a couple can be seen, and in the foreground some roses lie on the ground. It was first documented by Adriaan Loosjes, who mentioned it in his tribute to Hals in 1789 as being in the collection Gerrit Willem van Oosten de Bruyn. Much later Ernst Wilhelm Moes included it in his Iconographia Batavia, and Hofstede de Groot documented it again with the following description: \"WILLEM VAN HEYTHUYSEN. B. 123; M. 44.

His figure is turned three-quarters left\u00a0; his head almost faces the spectator, at whom he is looking.

Behind him a lilac- brown drapery hangs on a fantastic piece of architecture\u00a0; to the left is a view of a French garden\u00a0; on the ground lie roses. Painted about 1635.\"\r The painting served as inspiration to many, not just the poetry of Loosjes. Judith Leyster made a period copy, though she exchanged the rapier for a walking stick. Several people have posed in this stance in costume, most recently Kehinde Wiley who made a painting of a young black man in the same pose. In his 1989 catalog of the international Frans Hals exhibition Slive claimed it was previously incorrectly dated as 1635 but was actually painted 10 years earlier. The art historian Claus Grimm seemed to recognize that the drapery behind him looked similar to the iridescent dress of Hals' portrait of Aletta Hannemans, discussing these paintings after each other and placing them as painted in the same year. Possibly, as Heythuyzen was a cloth merchant, both were from workshops under his control and this portrait shows the source of his wealth as well as a romantic vision of himself as a bachelor. Because he is positioned facing left, we know that this is not a wedding pendant, as Hals always placed the woman on the right facing left. Heythuizen never married and died a bachelor.\n", "\nArtist: Frans Hals\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Isaak Abrahamsz Massa\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/portrait-of-isaak-abrahamsz-massa-1626\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Isaak Abrahamsz. Massa is a 1626 painting by Frans Hals that is in the collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario. It depicts Isaac Massa, a prosperous merchant and a close friend of Hals. Massa was the subject of an earlier work by Hals \u2013 Isaak Abrahamsz Massa and Beatrix van der Lean \u2013 which also featured his wife. Massa would commission another portrait by Hals in 1635.\r The painting is inscribed with the date 1626, but there is no mention of the identity of the sitter. For many years this led to debate, and it was often assumed to be a self-portrait. Wilhelm Valentiner was a noted proponent of this theory. Other scholars, such as Numa S. Trivas, did advance the idea that it was a portrait of Massa, and this was confirmed by the discovery of an inscription on a 17th-century engraving.\r The 1626 portrait is noted for its informality and vitality. Massa appears leaning over the back of a chair, a significant departure from standard formal portrait poses of the period. Hals would later use similar poses in a number of other paintings, and it would also be employed by other artists in later centuries. Massa\u2019s expression is candid, distracted. He is relaxed and engaged in his own affairs. Hals\u2019s brush strokes too are quick and free instead of smooth and controlled, which not only contributes to Hals\u2019s distinct style but also allowed him to complete an entire painting in one sitting, which accounts for the high volume he produced in his lifetime. Many of Hals\u2019s contemporaries were students of Caravaggio, influenced by his strong chiaroscuro. Though Hals may also have looked to Caravaggio his use of light is even, but Hals still manages to create bold highlights of Massa\u2019s facial features \u2013 the right side of his face is illuminated while the left falls into a natural shadow.\r Massa had made his fortune as a silk merchant in Russia, and was a noted expert on the country. The view through the window of large coniferous trees may be intended to reflect this, it being a scene of Muscovy where much of Massa's trading was conducted. The landscape in the background may have not been painted by Hals, perhaps being the work of noted landscape artist Pieter de Molijn. In Massa's hand he holds a sprig of holly. In traditional symbolism this represents friendship and constancy, and may reflect the close relationship between the artist and subject. It has also been interpreted as Massa's pledge to be faithful to his wife during his long absences.\r For many years the painting was part of the collection of the Earls of Spencer. The 1822 Bibliotheca Spenceriana, a catalogue of the Spencer collection, describes it as hanging in one of the bedrooms of the estate. In 1924 the 7th Earl Spencer was forced to sell off part of the family collection to pay down debts. He sold the Hals, along with other works to art merchant Joseph Duveen. The next year Duveen sold the painting to Canadian businessman Frank P. Wood. Upon Wood's death in 1955 his collection was given to the Art Gallery of Ontario, which is where the portrait still resides. In 1959 the painting was stolen from the gallery, along with five other masterworks. The insurance company agreed to pay a ransom for the stolen pictures, and three weeks after disappearing the painting was recovered from a storage room in Parkdale. It had sustained only slight damage.\n", "\nArtist: Frans Hals\nArtwork Name: Banquet of the Officers of the St. George Civic Guard Company\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/banquet-of-the-officers-of-the-st-george-civic-guard-company-detail-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Banquet of the Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1627 refers to a schutterstuk painted by Frans Hals for the St. Adrian (or St. Hadrian) civic guard of Haarlem. Today it is considered one of the main attractions of the Frans Hals Museum.\r Unlike other schutterstukken with each sash being the color of the \"rot\" or civic guard district, in this painting all officers are wearing the colors of the Dutch flag - oranje-blanje-bleu. However, one can see some small differences in the flag bearers, with Adriaen Matham on the left holding a hat with blue feather and wearing mostly blue in his sash, on his left the ensign Loth Schout wearing a white jacket, and standing on the right by the window, the ensign Pieter Ramp wearing a jacket with lovely cut sleeves featuring orange brocade and an orange feather in his hat.\r At the time Hals made his painting, Haarlem had three civic guard districts divided among the various \"rot-masters\". Officers were selected by the council of Haarlem to serve for three years, and this group had just finished their tenure and celebrated their end of service with a portrait.

The dog in the lower left is the only known dog in Hals' oeuvre. It is a greyhound and the name for this in Dutch is hazewind, which may be meant to indicate the relationship between the ensign Adriaen Matham and his lieutenant Haeswindius seated on the right.\r The painting previously hung with others in the old \"Doelen\" building, known today as the Haarlem Public Library. The paintings by Hals and others hung in the main hall of the building in the Gasthuisstraat.

It is a tronie, a study of facial expression and unusual costume, rather than a commissioned portrait. The display of cleavage was not a common feature of costume seen in public in Hals' time and place.\r This painting was catalogued by Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote \"119. THE GYPSY GIRL. B. 41; M. 263 - Half-length; life size. A laughing gipsy girl, seen almost in full face, looks down towards the right. Her brown hair falls on her shoulders. She wears a red bodice over a white chemise which exposes her breast. Yellow flesh-tones. A superb picture.\"\r Hofstede de Groot noticed that the dress of the sitter in this painting is similar to two other paintings by Hals, and he included them on either side of this one (catalogue numbers 118 and 120). This painting was first documented in a Paris sale in 1782 and every Frans Hals catalog after that includes her. In the exhibition catalog for the 1962 show, this painting's entry at #23 states that in a raking light one can see that diagonal strokes were once painted on either side of her breasts, indicating that Hals first made her d\u00e9collet\u00e9 less daring. Since Hals usually painted his genre works wet-on-wet in one go, such evidence of discovery while working is perhaps evidence of a certain reservation on Hals's part to make a portrait of a wanton woman, though in his time it was a common subject.\r She has not been in any recent international exhibitions however, and was last lent out for the 1962 Frans Hals exhibition in the Frans Hals Museum, where she inspired the Haarlem singer-songwriter Lennaert Nijgh to write a song about her which he called Malle Babbe, misleadingly named after another painting in the same exhibition.  The song celebrates the girl's lusty, vibrant sexuality. The raunchy song became a Dutch hit for Rob de Nijs in 1975 and is still immensely popular in versions by different artists. Today the painting is also sometimes referred to as Malle Babbe for this reason. No name has been discovered in the archives, but various art historians have assumed she was a prostitute.

The painting has also been titled as Hille Bobbe or the Witch of Haarlem. It was traditionally interpreted as a tronie, or genre painting in a portrait format, depicting a mythic witch-figure. The painting is now often identified as a genre-style portrait of a specific individual from Haarlem, known as Malle (meaning \"crazy\") Babbe, who may have been an alcoholic or suffered from a mental illness.\r The painting has been an object of artistic admiration from Hals's lifetime, as there are several copies and variants painted by his followers. It was admired by Gustave Courbet, who made a copy of it in 1869 while it was on view in Munich.\r The painting measures 75 \u00d7 64\u00a0cm and shows the face of a smiling woman, sitting at the corner of a table, apparently talking or laughing at someone or something to the right of the canvas. With her right hand, the woman is gripping a pewter beer mug with an opened lid. An owl sits on the woman\u2019s left shoulder. The clothing of the woman is simple and corresponds with the mode around 1630 in Haarlem. Her face is animated in an almost manic grimace. The very free handling of paint is typical of Hals' style, and not very different from that on his more formal commissioned portraits.\r The painting was for a long time mislabeled as Hille Bobbe (The Witch of Haarlem) though the inscription on the back of the picture frame reads Malle Babbe van Haerlem \u2026 Fr[a]ns Hals (Malle Babbe of Haarlem).\r Under the witch interpretation, the owl was considered a possible familiar. However the subject matter of Frans Hals in his other paintings would suggest that the painting is probably of a pub scene, in which case the owl would reflect the Dutch proverb, \"drunk as an owl.\"\r Research in the Netherlands municipality of Haarlem showed that a real Malle Babbe actually existed. She was included in a list of residents of the local hospital called Het Dolhuys, situated outside the city walls, which served people who were dangerous to themselves or to society, as well as a hospice for travellers arriving after the city gates had closed. Around 1642, Pieter Hals, a son of Frans Hals, was also in this hospice. Hals and this Malle Babbe had probably already met by this time, as she was evidently a known personality in Haarlem, although none other of her biographical details survive. In Dutch the adjective \"Malle\" signifies \"loony\" and that it is not uncommon to see painters or writers depict this type of village figure. In this type of depiction one can find a record of unbalanced figures of society as belonging to the scenery of everyday life, or the artist may enjoy exploring the thin line between sanity and lunacy.\r The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City is in possession of a similar painting. It is not clear who the creator of this painting is. In the past it was also attributed to Frans Hals, but it is now thought to be the work of one of his pupils.\n", "\nArtist: Frans Hals\nArtwork Name: Regents of the Old Men's Alms House, Haarlem\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/regents-of-the-old-men-s-alms-house-haarlem-1664\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Regents of the Old Men's Almshouse is a regents' group portrait of five regents and their servant painted by Frans Hals in 1664 for the Oude Mannenhuis in Haarlem, the Netherlands. It forms a pendant with the Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse.\r Though it is no longer known which name belongs with which face, the regents portrayed were Jonas de Jong, Mattheus Everzwijn, dr. Cornelis Westerloo, Daniel Deinoot and Johannes Walles.\r Frans Hals painted them in his \"loose style\", with rough brush strokes. The painting is traditionally dated 1664, though no archival evidence has yet been found to confirm this. The date is chosen as the middle of the term that the sitters served as regents. Though the paintings as pendants seem to belong together, they did not hang together, and as was the case in the St. Elisabeth hospital across the street, they probably each hung in a separate regents' meeting room; the one for the ladies in the ladies' meeting room and the one for the men in the men's meeting room.\r The standing figure second from the right is holding out a piece of paper. He is older and wearing a collar that was long out of fashion by the 1660s. He is probably a valued servant or concierge, but his name has been lost. Seated next to him is a man wearing a floppy hat perched at an angle. His face appears distorted and some critics felt that Hals had lost his touch, while others believed the man had been drunk or suffered from nerve damage in the right half of his face, perhaps from a stroke. Whatever the case, the regents never complained about the painting and it is likely that they were satisfied with the commission they gave to the elderly Hals.\r In the 19th century when Hals' loose brushwork became popular with impressionists, several copies were made of this painting. A much earlier copy that was made in the 18th century shows how layers of varnish almost made the table disappear altogether over time.\r Today the painting is considered one of the highlights of the Frans Hals Museum, which is housed in the same building for which it was originally commissioned. The complex has been unrecognizably rebuilt, however, and the painting no longer hangs in a specific place, but moves around according to various exhibition needs.\n", "\nArtist: Frans Hals\nArtwork Name: The Regentesses of the Old Men's Almhouse, Haarlem\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/the-regentesses-of-the-old-men-s-almhouse-haarlem-1664\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse Haarlem is a regents' group portrait of four regentesses and their servant painted by Frans Hals for the Oude Mannenhuis in Haarlem, the Netherlands.

The painting is traditionally dated 1664, though no archival evidence has yet been found to confirm this. The lack of any meticulous finishing, unusual in Hals' portraits of women, lead experts to assume this was painted towards the end of his life when he painted more loosely than in his younger years. The style of the women's dress also places the portrait well past the millstone collars of the 1640s and earlier. The painting currently hangs in the same location for which it was painted, namely the old men's almshouse in Haarlem known today as the Frans Hals Museum. According to Pieter Biesboer, the landscape painting on the rear wall is unidentified, but could possibly be an allegorical representation of the Good Samaritan, though no figures can be seen in it.\r In the 19th-century when Hals' loose brushwork became popular with impressionists, several copies were made of this painting:\r Max Lieberman also made a copy of one of the heads.

It measures 82 x 70.5\u00a0cm. The picture, painted in the chaotic Jan Steen \"style,\" depicts a family at home on December 5, the night celebrated in the Netherlands as the Feast of Saint Nicholas, or Sinterklaas.\r The focal point of the painting is the youngest daughter of the family, a golden-child, painted, in fact, in a golden smock and showing golden locks. She has behaved all year, and Saint Nicholas has rewarded her by stuffing her shoe with a doll and other treats, which she carries in her bucket. She is in stark contrast to her elder brother, standing to her right, who is sobbing, while another brother looks on, laughing. Apparently, the elder brother has been naughty, and his shoe, held up by an elder sister behind him, was left empty. Still there is hope for the sobbing boy. Hidden in the background, almost obscured by the draperies, his grandmother seems to beckon to him\u2014perhaps she is hiding a gift for him too, behind the heavy curtains. While the mother attempts to coax the golden girl to show her the gifts she received, the father, seated in the center of the painting, seems to smile as he remembers his own childhood on this festive night. Further to the right a child can be seen holding a baby and pointing up the chimney, while a younger child looks on in amazement, as he has probably just been told that this was Sinterklaas' method of gaining entry to the house.\r Jan Steen was a Dutch genre painter of the 17th century, Dutch painting of the time, including the landscapes of Aelbert Cuyp and Jacob van Ruisdael which show a unique rustic intimacy that carried over into genre paintings of domestic scenes. The paintings of Jan Vermeer and Jan Steen detail the same sense of tranquility and comfort in scenes from daily household life. As the Dutch economy thrived and the middle class of wealthy merchants grew, such domestic paintings rose in popularity. As members of the Middle-Class became the new patrons of art, the traditional religious and historical subjects were less popular than the newer household scenes that offer direct glimpses into the lives of Dutch families of the time. Jan Vermeer focused primarily on scenes with women in idyllic settings. Jan Steen, using the same style and subject chose instead domestic scenes that show a less perfected, and perhaps more realistic picture of daily life in the Netherlands.\r Jan Steen falls in the greater category of the Baroque period in painting. Baroque painting in the Netherlands was different from that in other countries in that it did not have the same idealized finery and magnificent grandeur. Instead, the Dutch style can be identified by its focus on extreme detail and realism, different even from neighboring Flanders and the splendid Flemish baroque paintings.\r Pictorial Light: As they strove for extreme realism, Dutch Golden Age painters mastered the art of depicting the quality of light, particularly concentrating on the way that it behaved and reflected on various surfaces. Some Dutch artists used tools like the camera obscura to help them compose their paintings with more perfect perspective.\n", "\nArtist: Jacob van Ruisdael\nArtwork Name: Bentheim Castle\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacob-van-ruisdael/bentheim-castle-1653\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBentheim Castle (1653) is an oil on canvas painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Jacob van Ruisdael.

It is an example of Dutch Golden Age painting and is now in the collection of the Amsterdam Museum, on loan to the Rijksmuseum.\r The painting shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about 20 kilometers from Utrecht, with a dominating cylindrical windmill, harmonised by the lines of river bank and sails, and the contrasts between light and shadow working together with the intensified concentration of mass and space.  The attention to detail is remarkable. Art historian Seymour Slive reports that both from an aeronautical engineering and a hydrological viewpoint the finest levels of details are correct, in the windmill's sails and the river's waves respectively.\r It is not known for certain when Ruisdael painted the Windmill. The painting is not dated, as very few of his works are after 1653. Dating subsequent work has therefore been largely detective work and speculation. It is assumed that it was painted in 1670.\r Unlike many other Ruisdaels the Windmill seems to have remained in Dutch hands.

Although the exact year is unknown, the work may be the earliest painting of the artist still extant, with some art historians placing it before Christ in the House of Martha and Mary and some after.\r The painting's solemn mood is unusual for a scene depicting the goddess Diana, and the nymph washing the central figure's feet has captured the attention of critics and historians, both for her activity and contemporary clothing. Rather than directly illustrating one of the dramatic moments in well-known episodes from myths about Diana, the scene shows a woman and her attendants quietly at her toilette. The theme of a woman in a private, reflective moment would grow stronger in Vermeer's paintings as his career progressed.\r Nothing of the work's history before the mid-19th century is known, and the painting was not widely accepted as one of Vermeer's until the early 20th century, when its similarities with Mary and Martha were noticed. About one ninth of the painting's width has been removed from the right side, and it was not discovered until 1999 or 2000 was that the sky in the upper right-hand corner had been added in the 19th century.\r The painting depicts the Greek and Roman goddess Diana (\"Artemis\" in Ancient Greece) with four of her companions. She wears a loose fitting, yellow dress with an animal-skin sash and, on her head, a diadem with a symbol of the crescent moon. As she sits on a rock, a nymph washes her left foot. Another, behind Diana, sits with her partially bare back to the viewer (the most skin Vermeer shows on a figure in any of his extant paintings), a third nymph, sitting at Diana's left, holds her own left foot with her right hand. A fourth stands in the rear, somewhat apart from the rest of the group and facing them and the viewer at an angle, her eyes cast down, her fists in front of her. A dog sits in the lower left-hand corner near Diana, its back to the viewer as it faces the goddess, her attendants and, immediately in front of it, a thistle.\r Except for the woman whose face is completely turned away from the viewer, all of the other faces in the painting are to one degree or another in shadow, including that of the dog. None of the women look at each other, each seemingly absorbed in their own thoughts, a fact which contributes to the solemn mood of the piece.\r In 1999-2000, when the painting underwent restoration work and was cleaned, it was discovered that an area of blue sky in the upper right corner had been added in the 19th century. Numerous reproductions up to that time had included the blue sky. Restorers covered over the patch with foliage to approximate the original image. The canvas had also been trimmed, particularly on the right, where about 15\u00a0cm was removed. Descriptions of the scene being in a \"woodland glade\" or \"near the edge of a wood\" may rely heavily on the patch of sky erroneously thought to be original to the painting, although light without shadows does fall on the scene from above and to the left, with short shadows forming to the viewer's right. The observation that the scene appeared to be taking place in \"the gathering dusk\" may have been influenced by the lighter, but darkening patch of sky contrasted sharply with the dark mass of foliage in the background of the painting, together with the shadows on all the visible faces.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: Christ in the House of Martha and Mary\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/christ-in-the-house-of-martha-and-mary\n\nWikipedia Article:\nChrist in the House of Martha and Mary is a painting finished in 1655 by the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer.

The story of Christ visiting the household of the two sisters Mary and Martha goes back to the New Testament. The work has also been called Christ in the House of Mary and Martha (reversing the last two names).\r The pigment analysis of this painting reveals the use of the pigments of the baroque period such as madder lake, yellow ochre, vermilion and lead white. Interestingly enough Vermeer did not paint the robe of Christ with his usual blue pigment of choice ultramarine (see for example The Milkmaid) but with a mixture of smalt, indigo and lead white.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: Saint Praxedis\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/saint-praxedis\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Praxedis is an oil painting attributed to Johannes Vermeer. This attribution has often been questioned. However, in 2014 the auction house Christie's announced the results of new investigations which in their opinion demonstrate conclusively that it is a Vermeer. The painting is a copy of a work by Felice Ficherelli, and depicts the early Roman martyr, Saint Praxedis or Praxedes. It may be Vermeer's earliest surviving work, dating from 1655.\r The painting shows the saint squeezing a martyr's blood from a sponge into an ornate vessel. It is closely related to a work by Ficherelli from 1640\u201345, now in the Collection Fergnani in Ferrara, and is generally assumed to be a copy of it (though see below for an alternative interpretation). The most obvious difference between the two is that there is no crucifix in the Ferrara work. It is Vermeer's only known close copy of another work.\r This is one of only four dated Vermeer paintings, the others being The Procuress (1656), The Astronomer (1668) and The Geographer (1669). Vermeer's two early history paintings, Christ in the House of Martha and Mary and Diana and Her Companions, are dated by almost all art historians to 1654-6, although opinions differ as to which is earlier.\r The painting's provenance before the mid-twentieth century is unknown. The collector Jacob Reder bought it at a minor auction house in New York in 1943. It first received significant attention as a possible Vermeer when being shown as a part of an exhibition of Florentine Baroque art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1969. The exhibition catalogue drew attention to the signature \"Meer 1655\" and Michael Kitson, reviewing the exhibition, suggested it could be a genuine Vermeer on the basis of stylistic similarities to Diana and Her Companions. Following Reder's death (also in 1969) it was bought by the art dealer Spencer A. Samuels, who also believed it to be a Vermeer. The Barbara Piasecka Johnson Collection Foundation bought it from Spencer in 1987. The leading Vermeer scholar Arthur Wheelock subsequently argued the case for the attribution to Vermeer in an article devoted to it in 1986.\r The painting was not included in the exhibition \"The Young Vermeer\" held in The Hague, Dresden and Edinburgh in 2010-11. However it was included in an exhibition of Vermeer's work held in Rome in 2012\u201313, curated by Wheelock, Liedtke and Sandrina Bandera.\r It was sold at Christie's in London on 8 July 2014 on behalf of the Barbara Piasecka Johnson Collection Foundation. It sold to an unknown buyer for \u00a36,242,500 (US$10,687,160), at the lower end of the estimated price range of \u00a36-\u00a38 million. Some art market commentators speculated that doubt about the attribution to Vermeer may have contributed to the relatively low price. From March 2015 it has been on display in the National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo, labelled as \"attributed to Johannes Vermeer\". This appears to be a long-term loan to the museum from a private collector.\r The painting may have two signatures. The more obvious of the two reads \"Meer 1655\", while the second appears as \"Meer N R o o\". It is possible that this second signature originally read \"Meer naar Riposo\", or \"Vermeer after Riposo\": Riposo was Ficherelli's nickname. The Doerner Institute's examination of the signatures concluded that both signatures were original and composed of pigments typical of the painting. Wheelock's examination also led him to conclude that both signatures were original, and recent technical examination has demonstrated that the clearer signature is likely to have been added at, or close to, the date the painting was created. However these new investigations agreed with the earlier opinion of the conservator J\u00f8rgen Wadum that the possible second signature is too indistinct to be deciphered.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: The Procuress\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/the-procuress-1656\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Procuress is a 1656 oil-on-canvas painting by the 24-year-old Johannes Vermeer. It can be seen in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden. It is his first genre painting and shows a scene of contemporary life, an image of mercenary love perhaps in a brothel. It differs from his earlier biblical and mythological scenes. It is one of only three paintings Vermeer signed and dated (the other two are The Astronomer and The Geographer).\r It seems Vermeer was influenced by earlier works on the same subject by Gerard ter Borch, and The Procuress (c. 1622) by Dirck van Baburen, which was owned by Vermeer's mother-in-law Maria Thins and hung in her home.\r The woman in black, the leering coupler, \"in a nun's costume\", could be the eponymous procuress, while the man to her right, \"wearing a black beret and a doublet with slashed sleeves\", has been identified as a self portrait of the artist. There is a resemblance with the painter in Vermeer's The Art of Painting.\r The man, a soldier, in the red jacket is fondling her breast and dropping a coin into the young woman's outstretched hand. According to Benjamin Binstock the painting could be understood as a psychological portrait of his adopted family. Vermeer is in the painting as a musician, in the employ of the madam. In his rather fictional book Binstock explains Vermeer used his family as models; the whore could be Vermeer's wife Catherina and the lewd soldier her brother Willem.\r The three-dimensional jug on the oriental rug is a piece of Westerwald Pottery. The kelim thrown over a bannister, probably produced in U\u015fak, covers a third of the painting and showes medaillons and leaves. The instrument is probably a cittern. The dark coat with five buttons was added by Vermeer in a later stage.\r In 1696 the painting, being sold on an auction in Amsterdam, was named \"A merry company in a room\". According to Binstock this \"dark and gloomy\" painting does not represent a didactic message.\r Some critics have thought the painting is atypical of Vermeer's style and expression, because it lacks the typical light.\r Pieter Swillens wrote in 1950 that\u2014if the work was by Vermeer at all\u2014it showed the artist \"seeking and groping\" to find a suitable mode of expression. Eduard Trautscholdt wrote 10 years before that \"The temperament of the 24-year-old Vermeer fully emerges for the first time\" [13]\r The painting was in the Waldstein collection in Dux (now Duchcov), then bought in 1741 for August III of Poland, the Elector of Saxony.\r The painting was exhibited in 1980 at the Restaurierte Kunstwerke in der Deutschen Demokratischen Republic exhibit in the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Altes Museum.\r The technical investigation of this painting was done in 1968 by Hermann K\u00fchn. The pigment analysis revealed Vermeer's use of his usual pigments such as ultramarine in the blue wine jug and lead-tin-yellow in the jacket of the woman. He employed also smalt in the green parts of the tablecloth and in the greenish background which is less usual for him.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/girl-reading-a-letter-at-an-open-window-1657\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGirl Reading a Letter at an Open Window is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer. Completed in approximately 1657\u201359, the well-preserved painting is on display at the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie in Dresden. For many years, the attribution of the painting\u2014which features a young Dutch woman reading a letter before an open window\u2014was lost, with first Rembrandt and then Pieter de Hooch being credited for the work before it was properly identified in 1880. After World War II, the painting was briefly in possession of the Soviet Union.\r The painting depicts a young Dutch blonde standing at an open window, in profile, reading a letter. A red drapery hangs over the top of the window glass, which has opened inward and which, in its lower right quadrant, reflects her. A tasseled ochre drapery in the foreground right, partially closed, masks a quarter of the room in which she stands. The color of the drape reflects the green of the woman's gown and the shades of the fruit tilted in a bowl on the red-draped table. On the table beside the bowl, a peach is cut in half, revealing its pit.\r In Vermeer, 1632\u20131675 (2000), Norbert Schneider indicates that the open window is on one level intended to represent \"the woman's longing to extend her domestic sphere\" beyond the constraints of her home and society, while the fruit \"is a symbol of extramarital relations.\" He concludes that the letter is a love letter either planning or continuing her illicit relationship. This conclusion, he says, is supported by the fact that x-rays of the canvas have shown that at one point Vermeer had featured a Cupid in the painting. This putto once hung in the upper right of the piece before, for whatever reason, Vermeer drew the draperies over it.\r The draperies themselves, hanging in the right foreground, are not an uncommon element for Vermeer, appearing in seven of his paintings. Even more common, the repoussoir appears in 25, with Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window, one of three which feature a rug-covered table or balustrade between the figure and the viewer. It was the last painting in which Vermeer featured this device.\r This painting and Officer and Laughing Girl represent the earliest known examples of the pointill\u00e9 (not to be confused with pointillism) for which Vermeer became known. John Michael Montias in Vermeer and His Milieu (1991) points out the \"tiny white globules\" that can be seen in the brighter parts of both paintings, including the still life elements of both and the blond hair specifically in this work. This use of light may support speculation among art historians that Vermeer used a mechanical optical device, such as a double concave lens mounted in a camera obscura, to help him achieve realistic light patterns in his paintings.\r Vermeer completed the painting in approximately 1657\u201359. In 1742, Augustus III of Poland, Elector of Saxony, purchased the painting under the mistaken belief that it had been painted by Rembrandt. In 1826, it was mis-attributed again, to Pieter de Hooch. It was so labeled when French art critic Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger came upon it, recognizing it as one of the rare works of the Dutch painter and restoring its proper attribution in 1860.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: A maid asleep\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/a-maid-asleep\n\nWikipedia Article:\nA Girl Asleep, also known as A Woman Asleep, A Woman Asleep at Table, and A Maid Asleep, is a painting by the Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, 1657. It is housed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and may not be lent elsewhere under the terms of the donor's bequest.\r According to Liedtke, the presence of the dog would have alluded to \"the sort of impromptu relationships canine suitors strike up on the street.\" The man and the dog were replaced with a mirror on a far wall, suggesting how the experience of the senses quickly passes, and a chair left at an angle with a pillow on it, possibly signifying indolence, together with a hint of recent company. The idea that she was recently together with someone is reinforced by the wine pitcher, the glass on its side and the possible presence of a knife and fork on the table. The Chinese bowl with fruit is a symbol of temptation, and for a Vermeer contemporary familiar with the symbolism of Dutch art of the time, the knife and jug lying open-mouthed under a gauzy material would have brought to mind more than social intercourse.\r The painting was very likely owned by Vermeer's patron, Pieter van Ruijvan, who also owned The Milkmaid, which has a similar tension between the symbolism of sexual or romantic relations with maids and their presentation in a way that was more sympathetic than the established tradition.\r The painting was among the large collection of Vermeer works sold on May 16, 1696, from the estate of Jacob Dissius (1653\u20131695). It is widely believed the collection was originally owned by Dissius' father-in-law, Pieter Claesz van Ruijven of Delft as Vermeer's major patron, then passed down to Ruijven's daughter (1655\u20131682), who would have left it to Dissius. The work's history from that point is unknown until its ownership by John Waterloo Wilson in Paris after 1873. It was sold on March 14, 1881, in Paris when the Sedelmeyer Gallery in Paris bought it and sold it later that year to Rodolphe Kann, also of Paris. Kann owned the work until 1907. It was sold in 1908 through the Duveen Brothers of London to Benjamin Altman, and it was exhibited in New York in 1909. Altman owned the work until 1913, when it passed into the hands of the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a bequest.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: Officer and Laughing Girl\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/officer-and-laughing-girl\n\nWikipedia Article:\nOfficer and Laughing Girl, also known as Officer and a Laughing Girl, Officer With a Laughing Girl or De Soldaat en het Lachende Meisje, was painted by the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer between 1655 and 1660. It was painted in oil on canvas, typical of most Dutch artists of the time, and is 50.5 by 46\u00a0cm. It now resides in The Frick Collection in New York.\r Officer and Laughing Girl includes many of the characteristics of Vermeer's style. The main subject is a woman in a yellow dress, light is coming from the left hand side of the painting from an open window, and there is a large map on the wall. Each of these elements occur in some of his other paintings, although this painting differs slightly with the man also sitting at the table. Art historians, who have suggested conflicting interpretations of the work, believe that a painting by Gerard van Honthorst inspired the composition, and that Vermeer used a camera obscura to create the perspective in this painting.\r The main subject is the woman, and soft, direct light falls on her face. She resembles Vermeer's wife, Catharina Bolnes, who is believed to have posed for many of his paintings. With x-ray photographs, art historians can see that Vermeer had planned to paint the woman with a large white collar which would have hid much of her yellow dress. Also, her cap was later extended to cover all of her hair, in order to draw attention to her face and expression. This yellow bodice with braiding has appeared in many of Vermeer's other portraits. It is called a schort and was usually worn as an everyday, common dress. The woman is also wearing a blue apron over her dress, but it is hidden in the shadows caused by the table. Blue aprons were common attire at that time because they hid stains well. Art historians have interpreted this to mean that the soldier surprised the girl with an impromptu visit during her morning chores. The woman is holding a wine glass, usually used for white wine. Because at that time, wine cost more than beer, it illustrates her wealth.\r The man in the painting is a cavalier wearing a red coat and an expensive hat, showing his wealth and rank. His hat is wide- brimmed and made of beaver pelt, which was weather resistant and good for snowy and rainy conditions. The pelts for these hats were imported from the New World. This hat was probably from New Netherlands, which was then under the Dutch West India Company's control. The red in his uniform is associated with power and passion, bringing a passionate and emotional mood to the painting. His rank as an officer is identified by the black sash he wears. However, his presence in the immediate foreground is what the viewers notice first. His striking presence adds drama and mystery to the mood of the composition. This artistic device\u2014in which an object is placed in the foreground to increase the depth of field of the overall painting\u2014is called repoussoir. Caravaggio often used this technique and Vermeer probably learned it from a Caravaggist's painting.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: The Little Street\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/the-little-street\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Little Street (Het Straatje) is a painting by the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, executed c. 1657\u201358. It is exhibited at the Rijksmuseum of Amsterdam, and signed on the left hand corner below the window \"I V MEER\".\r The painting is made in oil on canvas, and it is a relatively small painting, being 54.3 centimetres (21.4\u00a0in) high by 44.0 centimetres (17.3\u00a0in) wide.\r The painting, showing a quiet street, depicts a typical aspect of the life in a Dutch Golden Age town. It is one of only three Vermeer paintings of views of Delft, the others being View of Delft and the now lost House Standing in Delft. This painting is considered to be an important work of the Dutch master.\r Straight angles alternate with the triangle of the house and of the sky giving the composition a certain vitality. The walls, stones and brickwork are painted in a thick colour, that it makes them almost palpable.\r Vermeer achieved the realistic depiction of the surfaces with the masterful application of a relatively limited number of pigments. He employed red ochre and madder lake for the reddish-brown brick wall, the blue in the sky contains lead white and natural ultramarine. The green shutters and foliage are painted with azurite mixed with lead-tin-yellow.\r While generally agreed to depict a contemporary street scene in 17th-century Delft, where Vermeer lived and worked, the exact location of the scene Vermeer painted has long been a topic of research and dispute, with studies arguing for the Voldersgracht, where the Vermeer Centre is located, or the Nieuwe Langendijk at the present-day numbers 22 to 26. Later archival research based on the city's quay dues register, which gives detailed measurements of all houses and passageways at the time along the canals of Delft, has resulted in the conclusion that the site is the Vlamingstraat, a street with a narrow canal, at the present-day numbers 40 and 42.\r The property on the right in the painting belonged to Vermeer\u2019s aunt, Ariaentgen Claes van der Minne. She had a business selling tripe, and the passageway beside the house was known as the Penspoort , or Tripe Gate. Vermeer\u2019s mother and sister also lived on the same canal, diagonally opposite.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: The glass of wine\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/the-glass-of-wine\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Wine Glass (also The Glass of Wine or Lady and Gentleman Drinking Wine, Dutch: Het glas wijn) is a 1660 painting by Johannes Vermeer now in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin. It portrays a seated woman and a standing man drinking in an interior setting. The work contains the conventions of genre painting of the Delft School developed by Pieter de Hooch in the late 1650s. It contains figures situated in a brightly lit and spacious interior, while its architectural space is highly defined. The figures are set in the middle ground, rather than positioned in the foreground.\r Vermeer was about 27 when he painted The Glass of Wine, and according to the critic Walter Liedtke, \"No analysis of artistic conventions can suggest the sheer beauty and extraordinary refinement of a painting like The Glass of Wine, which may be considered one of Vermeer's first fully mature works\".\r The concept of figures drinking around a table, and the portrayal of a woman drinking from a glass are taken directly from De Hooch's A Dutch Courtyard. However, Vermeer's work breaks away from the prototypes of De Hooch in that the interior is rendered in a far more elegant and higher-class setting than the older master's works. The clothes of the figures, the patterned tablecloth, the gilded picture frame hanging on the back wall, and the coat of arms in the stained window glass all suggest a wealthier setting.\r The scene likely represents some type of courtship, but the roles being played by the two figures are not clear. The woman has just drained the glass of wine and the man seems impatient to pour her more, almost as if he is trying to get her drunk. A musical instrument, the cittern, lies on the chair with musical notebooks. But the figure of Temperance is depicted in the stained glass window, adding to the tension in the scene.\r Compared to his earlier paintings, Vermeer's brushwork in The Wine Glass is subdued, while the faces and clothes of the figures are depicted with wide smooth outlines. Only in the tapestry of the tablecloth and the window glass did the artist apply finely detailed, linear brush strokes. At the time Vermeer was not the only Dutch artist attempting to develop the ideas of De Hooch; contemporary paintings from Jan Steen, Gerard Ter Borch, and Frans van Mieris the Elder also display a refined technique.\r The painting shares elements with other Vermeer works. The Girl with the Wine Glass (1659\u20131660) portrays two men, but in common with The Wine Glass it has a woman seated at a table with a glass of wine, and the tiled floors and stained-glass windows in both are very similar. The same wine pitcher appears in an earlier Vermeer, A Girl Asleep (1657).\r The Wine Glass is a transitional work, and as such, is not commonly viewed as one of Vermeer's finest. According to art critic Lawrence Gowing, comparing the work with Gabriel Metsu's The Duet, it \"lacks the sociable fluency, the ingratiating inventiveness\".\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: The Milkmaid\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/the-milkmaid\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Milkmaid (Dutch: De Melkmeid or Het Melkmeisje), sometimes called The Kitchen Maid, is an oil-on-canvas painting of a \"milkmaid\", in fact, a domestic kitchen maid, by the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer. It is now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, which regards it as \"unquestionably one of the museum's finest attractions\".\r The exact year of the painting's completion is unknown, with estimates varying by source. The Rijksmuseum estimates it as circa 1658. According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, it was painted in about 1657 or 1658. The \"Essential Vermeer\" website gives a broader range of 1658\u20131661.\r Despite its traditional title, the picture clearly shows a kitchen or housemaid, a low-ranking indoor servant, rather than a milkmaid who actually milks the cow, in a plain room carefully pouring milk into a squat earthenware container (now commonly known as a \"Dutch oven\") on a table. Also on the table are various types of bread. She is a young, sturdily built woman wearing a crisp linen cap, a blue apron and work sleeves pushed up from thick forearms. A foot warmer is on the floor behind her, near Delft wall tiles depicting Cupid (to the viewer's left) and a figure with a pole (to the right). Intense light streams from the window on the left side of the canvas.\r The painting is strikingly illusionistic, conveying not just details but a sense of the weight of the woman and the table. \"The light, though bright, doesn't wash out the rough texture of the bread crusts or flatten the volumes of the maid's thick waist and rounded shoulders\", wrote Karen Rosenberg, an art critic for The New York Times. Yet with half of the woman's face in shadow, it is \"impossible to tell whether her downcast eyes and pursed lips express wistfulness or concentration,\" she wrote.\r \"It's a little bit of a Mona Lisa effect\" in modern viewers' reactions to the painting, according to Walter Liedtke, curator of the department of European paintings at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and organizer of two Vermeer exhibits. \"There's a bit of mystery about her for modern audiences. She is going about her daily task, faintly smiling. And our reaction is 'What is she thinking?'\"\r The woman would have been known as a \"kitchen maid\" or maid-of-all-work rather than a specialised \"milkmaid\" at the time the painting was created: \"milk maids\" were women who milked cows; kitchen maids worked in kitchens. For at least two centuries before the painting was created, milkmaids and kitchen maids had a reputation as being predisposed to love or sex, and this was frequently reflected in Dutch paintings of kitchen and market scenes from Antwerp, Utrecht and Delft. Some of the paintings were slyly suggestive, like The Milkmaid, others more coarsely so.\r The leading artists in this tradition were the Antwerp painters Joachim Beuckelaer (c. 1535\u20131575) and Frans Snyders (1579\u20131657), who had many followers and imitators, as well as Pieter Aertsen (who, like Beukelaer, had clients in Delft), the Utrecht Mannerist painter Joachim Wtewael (1566\u20131638), and his son, Peter Wtewael (1596\u20131660). Closer to Vermeer's day, Nicolaes Maes painted several comic pictures now given titles such as The Lazy Servant. However by this time there was an alternative convention of painting women at work in the home as exemplars of Dutch domestic virtue, dealt with at length by Simon Schama.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: Girl interrupted at her music\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/girl-interrupted-at-her-music\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGirl Interrupted at Her Music is a painting by the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer. It was painted in the baroque style, probably between the years 1658 and 1659, using oil on canvas. In this painting, Vermeer depicts a young woman at her music with an older gentleman. This painting shows the typical courtship during the 17th century in Europe. It also focuses on the importance of music when it comes to love.\r The room that they are shown in is one of higher class, most likely belonging to a person of haute bourgeoisie. The painting is very reminiscent of Vermeer\u2019s other works.\r The wine glass, discreetly shown on the table behind the songbook, is tied with both joyfulness and seduction. In the 17th century it was popular to paint scenes that depicted feasts that included drinking, gaming, and playing music. Later on, these large gatherings became smaller and more exclusive with two or three people shown. Drinking wine was also associated with love during this time period. You can see that the glass is full and untouched, which symbolizes the slow moving relationship between the man and the woman.\r On the left side of the painting is a multi-paned window, from which the light source is provided for the scene. Vermeer used the same window design in nine of his other works (The Music Lesson, The Girl with the Wine Glass, The Glass of Wine, Officer and Laughing Girl, Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid, Woman with a Water Jug, Woman with a Lute, Woman Holding a Balance, and Woman with a Pearl Necklace). Some experts questioned whether this painting was by Vermeer. The precision of the lighting from the window was thought to prove that it was in fact an original Vermeer.\r The chairs depicted in the painting are thought to have been from Spain. They are some of the few objects in the painting that were not damaged by heavy restoration. You can see the minute details including the lion head carving, the brass studs, and the \u201clozenge\u201d pattern that were all popular aspects of furniture during the time.\r The hazy painting in the background of the scene is of Cupid. The painting within a painting was discovered after its restoration in 1907; it had been covered up by a wall and a hanging violin. Several observations have been made about the Cupid painting and what it could have to do with the overall painting, including that Cupid may be warning the couple about the dangers of love, that Cupid's upraised hand was a symbol that you must only have one lover, that Cupid is holding up a blank card which represents love as a game, or shows that \"love is in the air\". The reason for Vermeer including the miniature Cupid painting may never be revealed due to the painting's damaged condition.\r On the table sits a vase made of porcelain and silver, likely used for serving wine. One of the main centers for porcelain in the Netherlands was and still is Delft, although they had \"limited success\" in recreating Chinese porcelain.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: View of Delft\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/view-on-delft\n\nWikipedia Article:\nView of Delft (Dutch: Gezicht op Delft) is an oil painting by Johannes Vermeer, painted ca. 1660\u20131661. The painting of the Dutch artist's hometown is among his most popular, painted at a time when cityscapes were uncommon. It is one of three known paintings of Delft by Vermeer, along with The Little Street and the lost painting House Standing in Delft. The use of pointillism in the work suggests that it postdates The Little Street.\r The technical analysis shows that Vermeer used a limited choice of pigments for this painting: lead white, yellow ochre, natural ultramarine and madder lake are the main painting materials. His painting technique on the other hand is very elaborate and meticulous.\r In 2011, the painting was featured on gold and silver commemorative coins issued by the Royal Dutch Mint. The painting also features in Marcel Proust's novel In Search of Lost Time. Proust himself greatly admired Vermeer, particularly a View of Delft. When seeing the work for the first time, Proust is quoted as saying:\r \"Ever since I saw the View of Delft in the museum in The Hague, I have known that I had seen the most beautiful painting in the world\".\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: Young Woman with a Pearl Necklace\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/young-woman-with-a-pearl-necklace\n\nWikipedia Article:\nWoman with a Pearl Necklace by Johannes Vermeer is a seventeenth-century Northern European painting. Painted in oils on canvas, Johannes Vermeer portrayed a young Dutch woman, most likely of upper-class-descent, dressing herself with two yellow ribbons, pearl earrings, and a pearl necklace. As a very popular artist of the 17th century, the Dutch Golden Age, Vermeer depicted many women in similar circumstances within interior, domestic scenes. The same woman also appears in The Love Letter and A Lady Writing a Letter.\r Johannes Vermeer (1632- 1675) of Delft was one of Netherlands' most prominent Dutch painters. Specialising in interior scenes, Vermeer developed a distinct style for his many domestic paintings. Popular with middle-class patrons, Vermeer offered glimpses into the lives of Holland's cultured citizens. Although little is known and/ or proven about Vermeer\u2019s life, historians do know of his baptism and life in Delft where he was raised by a craftsman father and married a Catholic girl by the name of Catherina Bolnes. This marriage may have caused him to convert to Catholicism.\r As an innkeeper and art dealer, Vermeer painted dozens of paintings in which specific attributes can be noted. These attributes include the use of yellow and blue tones, the depiction of women, the use of wall coverings (maps, artworks, etc.), depiction of domestic tools, heavy drapery, light angles from the left, as well as prominent and telling facial expressions, and narrative-like objects. These touches allowed Vermeer to idealize his depiction of Dutch women and their values. Some of his most notable works include Girl with a Pearl Earring, The Love Letter, and The Art of Painting, all of which share the aforementioned qualities of a true Vermeer painting.\r Painted in 1664, this 21 5/8 X 17 \u00be inch scene depicts a young Dutch woman looking left toward a window\u2019s light source. Dressed in a yellow, fur-trimmed coat, this young woman most likely comes from an upper-class family. With Vermeer\u2019s distinctive style, it incorporates the color yellow, a draped curtain, framed pictures on the walls, a light source from the left, as well as domestic tools, and an expressive profile.\r For example, to the far left, a yellow, drawn back curtain is used. With a rich tone of lemon yellow to complete the woman\u2019s jacket, Vermeer is able to create a balance between the two ends of his painting. The window that the curtain would cover is very similar to that in his painting Woman with a Water Jug.\r On that same side of the wall, Vermeer displays a framed mirror. The black frame is most likely made of ebony, which indicates wealth and status. The fact that Vermeer uses a mirror is also distinctive. Vermeer associated the sense of reflection to portray the woman with vanity or feminine power. Also due to Vermeer\u2019s interest in certain Greek muses, he used the mirror to portray duality. However, according to the Essential Vermeer Website, other historians believe this mirror may indicate a Dutch theme of vanitas or the reminder of death. However, there is not a specific way historians can determine this.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: Woman reading a letter (Woman in Blue Reading a Letter)\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/woman-reading-a-letter-woman-in-blue-reading-a-letter\n\nWikipedia Article:\nWoman Reading a Letter (Dutch: Brieflezende vrouw) is a painting by the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. Part of the collection of the City of Amsterdam as part of the Van der Hoop bequest, it has been in the Rijksmuseum since its inception, and was thus the first Vermeer they acquired.\r The central element of the painting is a woman in blue standing in front of a window (not depicted) reading a letter. The woman appears to be pregnant, although many have argued that the woman's rounded figure is simply a result of the fashions of the day. Although the woman's loose clothing may be suggestive, pregnancy was very rarely depicted in art during this period.\r While the contents of the letter are not depicted, the composition of the painting is revealing. The map of the Netherlands on the wall behind the woman has been interpreted as suggesting that the letter she reads was written by a traveling husband. Alternatively, the box of pearls barely visible on the table before the woman might suggest a lover as pearls are sometimes a symbol of vanity. The very action of letter-reading reflects a thematic pattern throughout Vermeer's works, as the quotidian, private moment becomes revealing of the human condition.\r The painting is unique among Vermeer's interiors in that no fragment of corner, wall or ceiling can be seen.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: The Concert\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/the-concert\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Concert (c. 1664) is a painting by Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. The 72.5-by-64.7-centimetre (28.5 by 25.5\u00a0in) picture depicts a man and two women playing music. It belongs to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, but was stolen in 1990 and remains missing. It is thought to be the most valuable unrecovered stolen painting ever, with a value estimated at over $200,000,000.\r The picture shows three musicians: a young woman sitting at a harpsichord, a man playing the lute, and a woman who is singing. The harpsichord's upturned lid is decorated with an Arcadian landscape; its bright coloring stands in contrast to the two paintings hanging on the wall to the right and left. A viola da gamba can be seen lying on the floor.\r Of the two paintings in the background, the one on the right is The Procuress by Dirck Van Baburen, a work which also appears in Vermeer's Lady Seated at a Virginal, probably painted around six years after The Concert. The painting on the left is a wild pastoral landscape. The musical theme in Dutch painting in Vermeer's time often connoted love and seduction, a motif reinforced by the presence of Baburen's sexually exuberant picture.\r The location of the painting was unknown for a long time. Sold in Amsterdam in 1696, it did not reappear until 1780. It was acquired by Isabella Stewart Gardner in an 1892 auction in Paris for $5,000 and subsequently displayed in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, beginning in 1903. On the night of March 18, 1990, thieves disguised as policemen stole 13 works out of the museum, including The Concert. To this day the painting has not resurfaced.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: Woman with a lute\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/woman-with-a-lute\n\nWikipedia Article:\nWoman with a Lute, also known as Woman with a Lute Near a Window, is a painting created about 1662\u20131663 by Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer and now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\r The painting depicts a young woman wearing an ermine-trimmed jacket and enormous pearl earrings as she eagerly looks out a window, presumably expecting a male visitor. \"A musical courtship is suggested by the viola da gamba on the floor in the foreground and by the flow of songbooks across the tabletop and onto the floor,\" according to a web page about the work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art website. The tuning of a lute was recognized by contemporary viewers as a symbol of the virtue of temperance. The oil on canvas work is 20\u00bc\u00a0inches high and 18\u00a0inches wide (51.4 \u00d7 45.7\u00a0cm). The painting's canvas was almost certainly cut from the same bolt as that used for Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid.\r The work likely was painted shortly after Young Woman with a Water Pitcher, and it shares with that painting its framing of the figure within rectangular motifs. But the painting has more muted tones, reflecting a shift in that direction by Vermeer in the mid- to late 1660s. At this time, Vermeer began using shadows and soft contours to further evoke an atmosphere of intimacy. \"The impression of spatial recession and atmosphere is somewhat diminished by darkening with age of the objects in the foreground and by abrasion of the paint surface, mostly in the same area,\" according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art web page.\r The painting was given to the museum in 1900 by a bequest of railroad industrialist Collis P. Huntington.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: The Girl with a Pearl Earring\nArtwork Genre: portrait,tronie\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/the-girl-with-a-pearl-earring\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGirl with a Pearl Earring (Dutch: Meisje met de parel) is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer. It is a tronie of a girl wearing a headscarf and a pearl earring. The painting has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague since 1902. In 2006, the Dutch public selected it as the most beautiful painting in the Netherlands.\r The painting is a tronie, the Dutch 17th-century description of a 'head' that was not meant to be a portrait. It depicts a European girl wearing an exotic dress, an oriental turban, and an improbably large pearl earring. In 2014, Dutch astrophysicist Vincent Icke raised doubts about the material of the earring and argued that it looks more like polished tin than pearl on the grounds of the specular reflection, the pear shape and the large size of the earring.\r The work is oil on canvas and is 44.5\u00a0cm (17.5\u00a0in) high and 39\u00a0cm (15\u00a0in) wide. It is signed \"IVMeer\" but not dated. It is estimated to have been painted around 1665.\r After the most recent restoration of the painting in 1994, the subtle colour scheme and the intimacy of the girl's gaze toward the viewer have been greatly enhanced. During the restoration, it was discovered that the dark background, today somewhat mottled, was initially intended by the painter to be a deep enamel-like green. This effect was produced by applying a thin transparent layer of paint, called a glaze, over the present-day black background. However, the two organic pigments of the green glaze, indigo and weld, have faded.\r On the advice of Victor de Stuers, who for years tried to prevent Vermeer's rare works from being sold to parties abroad, Arnoldus Andries des Tombe purchased the work at an auction in The Hague in 1881, for only two guilders with a thirty cents buyer's premium (around \u20ac24 at current purchasing power). At the time, it was in poor condition. Des Tombe had no heirs and donated this and other paintings to the Mauritshuis in 1902.\r In 2012, as part of a traveling exhibition while the Mauritshuis was being renovated and expanded, the painting was exhibited in Japan at the National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo, and in 2013\u20132014 the United States, where it was shown at the High Museum in Atlanta, the de Young Museum in San Francisco and in New York City at the Frick Collection. Later in 2014 it was exhibited in Bologna, Italy. In June 2014, it returned to the Mauritshuis museum which stated that the painting will not leave the museum in the future.\r The painting was investigated by the scientists of the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Heritage and FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics (AMOLF) Amsterdam.\r The ground is dense and yellowish in color and is composed of chalk, lead white, ochre and very little black. The dark background of the painting contains bone black, weld (luteolin, reseda luteola), chalk, small amounts of red ochre, and indigo. The face and draperies were painted mainly using ochres, natural ultramarine, bone black, charcoal black and lead white.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: The music lesson\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/the-music-lesson\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Music Lesson or Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman by Johannes Vermeer, is a painting of young female pupil receiving the titular music lesson.\r The picture was sold in May 1696 in Delft, part of the collection of Jacob Dissous, which included many Vermeers. It was later acquired by Venetian artist Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini in 1718, with Pellegrini\u2019s collection later being bought by Joseph Smith. The Music Lesson has been part of the Royal Collection of Great Britain since 1762, when King George III bought Smith's collection of paintings. When the painting was acquired it was believed to be a work by Frans van Mieris the elder because of a misinterpretation of the signature. It was not correctly attributed to Vermeer until 1866 by Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9, though some scholars were skeptical whether it was Vermeer or not. It has at various times been kept at both Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, and is depicted in Charles Wild's Windsor Castle: the King's Closet, 1816, a watercolour prepared for William Pyne's History of the Royal Residences.\r The painting was investigated by Hermann K\u00fchn in 1968 and there is also material on the pigment analysis on the website of the National Gallery in London where the painting was included in the exhibition \"Vermeer and Music: The Art of Love and Leisure\" in 2013. The Music Lesson is a mature work of Vermeer and his handling of colour and his choice of painting materials is but one of the aspects proving his mastery. The painting is dominated by dark areas such as the bluish-black floor painted in bone black with addition of natural ultramarine.\r The 2013 documentary film Tim's Vermeer documents inventor and entrepreneur Tim Jenison's attempt to recreate The Music Lesson to test his theory that Vermeer painted with the help of optical devices. Jenison is given the opportunity for a brief private viewing of the painting at Buckingham Palace. The film's claim that Vermeer used something similar to Jenison's technique has been derided by art critics Jonathan Jones and Bendor Grosvenor.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: Woman Holding a Balance\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/woman-holding-a-balance-1665\n\nWikipedia Article:\nWoman Holding a Balance, also called Woman Testing a Balance, is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age artist Johannes Vermeer.\r At one time the painting, completed 1662\u20131663, was known as Woman Weighing Gold, but closer evaluation has determined that the balance in her hand is empty. Opinions on the theme and symbolism of the painting differ, with the woman alternatively viewed as a symbol of holiness or earthliness.\r In the painting, Vermeer has depicted a young woman holding an empty balance before a table on which stands an open jewelry box, the pearls and gold within spilling over. A blue cloth rests in the left foreground, beneath a mirror, and a window to the left \u2014 unseen save its golden curtain \u2014 provides light. Behind the woman is a painting of the Last Judgment featuring Christ with raised, outstretched hands. The woman may have been modeled on Vermeer's wife, Catharina Vermeer.\r According to Robert Huerta in Vermeer and Plato: Painting the Ideal (2005), the image has been variously \"interpreted as a vanitas painting, as a representation of divine truth or justice, as a religious meditative aid, and as an incitement to lead a balanced, thoughtful life.\" Some viewers have imagined the woman is weighing her valuables, while others compare her actions to Christ's, reading parable into the pearls. Some art critics, including John Michael Montias who describes her as \"symbolically weighing unborn souls\", have seen the woman as a figure of Mary. To some critics who perceive her as measuring her valuables, the juxtaposition with the final judgment suggests that the woman should be focusing on the treasures of Heaven rather than those of Earth. In this perspective, the mirror on the wall may reinforce the vanity of her pursuits.\r Completed in 1662 or 1663, the painting was previously called Woman Weighing Gold before microscopic evaluation confirms that the balance in her hands is empty. The painting was among the large collection of Vermeer works sold on May 16, 1696 in Amsterdam from the estate of Jacob Dissius (1653\u20131695). It received 155 guilders, considerably above the prices fetched at the time for his Girl Asleep at a Table (62) and The Officer and the Laughing Girl (approximately 44), but somewhat below The Milkmaid (177).\r The first pigment analysis of this painting by Hermann K\u00fchn revealed the use of ultramarine for the blue tablecloth and lead white for the grey wall. The pigment in the bright yellow curtain was identified as indian yellow. The subsequent technical investigations of the painting by Robert L. Feller (1974) and M.E. Gifford (1994) have shown that the painting had been extended by approximately five centimetre on every side at a much later date. The sample investigated by H. K\u00fchn in 1968 was unfortunately taken from this extension. The proper pigment of the yellow curtain is lead-tin-yellow. The full pigment analysis according to the latest data is illustrated at Colourlex.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: Young Woman with a Water Pitcher\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/young-woman-with-a-water-pitcher\n\nWikipedia Article:\nWoman with a Water Jug, also known as Young Woman with a Water Pitcher, is a painting finished between 1660\u20131662 by the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer in the Baroque style.

She is opening a window with her right hand, while she holds a water jug with her left hand. This jug rests on a larger platter. Both of these, among other objects, are upon on a table. This is decorated with a red-colored tablecloth. Behind the table stands a chair upon which lies a blue material. The woman gazes out the window. The clothing of the woman consists of a dark blue dress with a black and gold overpiece. A white cloth serves as her headpiece. A map hangs in the background on the wall.\r This painting is one of a closely related group painted in the early to mid-1660s as the artist was not using linear perspective and geometric order and the light was his only source of emphasis.\r Young Woman with a Water Pitcher was purchased by Henry Gurdon Marquand in 1887 at a Paris gallery for $800. When Marquand brought it to the United States, it was the first Vermeer in America. Marquand donated the artwork along with other pieces in his collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. \n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: A lady writing\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/a-lady-writing\n\nWikipedia Article:\nA Lady Writing a Letter (also known as A Lady Writing; Dutch: Schrijvend meisje) is an oil painting attributed to 17th century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. It is believed to have been completed around 1665. The Lady is seen to be writing a letter and has been interrupted, so gently turns her head to see what is happening. She wears twelve pearls (10 on the necklace and two earrings).\r Many of the objects seen in the painting, such as the woman's coat, the cloth on the table, and the string of pearls, also appear in other Vermeer works. This has led to speculation that he or his family members owned the objects, and even that the subjects of the paintings are his relatives. It has often been suggested that in his paintings, Vermeer sought to grant to his models that which he could not endow to his wife and family: calm and affluence.\r A Lady Writing a Letter was donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1962 by Harry Waldron Havemeyer and Horace Havemeyer. In its first loan to the Norton Simon Museum, the National Gallery of Art agreed to lend the painting for exhibition at the Pasadena, California museum from November 7, 2008 through February 9, 2009.\r In Blue Balliett's children's book, Chasing Vermeer, A Lady Writing is stolen on its way from the National Gallery of Art to Chicago, causing the main conflict of the story.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: Girl with a Flute\nArtwork Genre: portrait,tronie\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/girl-with-a-flute\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGirl with a Flute is a small painting attributed to the Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, executed 1665\u20131670.

Possibly another painter finished the painting after an initial start by Vermeer. The composition is comparable to Girl with a Red Hat, the only other work Vermeer painted on panel. The bluegreen jacket with the fur lining is also used in Woman Holding a Balance and The Concert and is listed as a 'oude groene false mantel met een witte bonte kant' in Vermeer's inventory after his death. Just like Girl with a Red Hat and Girl with a Pearl Earring the model wears a glass, lacquered pearl earring.\r Girl with a Flute is a so-called tronie, a study of a remarkable facial expression or a stock character in costume. This was a popular genre in Dutch Golden Age painting. Tronies were produced for the mass market, not for specific patrons. Unlike with portraits the models were always anonymous.\r Girl with a Flute was in possession of the family of Pieter van Ruijven and was sold at the 1696 Dissius auction in Amsterdam. The work was probably one of the three tronies with catalogue numbers 38, 39 and 40. In the 19th century the painting was owned by the Van Son family in Brabant. In 1923 the American art collector Joseph E. Widener bought the painting. Widener donated his extensive and valuable art collection in 1939 to the National Gallery of Art, including this Vermeer painting.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: Girl with the red hat\nArtwork Genre: portrait,tronie\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/girl-with-the-red-hat\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGirl with a Red Hat is a rather small painting, signed by the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. It is seen as one of a number of Vermeer's tronies \u2013 depictions of models fancifully dressed that were not (as far as is known) intended to be portraits of specific, identifiable subjects. Others believe it is a portrait. Whether Vermeer chose family members as models or found them elsewhere in Delft is irrelevant to the appreciation of his paintings. Its attribution to Vermeer \u2013 as it is on a (recycled) wood panel and not on canvas \u2013 has been a matter of controversy with scholars on both sides of the argument.\r The painting, supposed to be executed 1665\u20131666, may have been among those owned by Vermeer's patron, Pieter Claesz van Ruijven and possibly, through inheritance it may have been passed on to his wife, Maria de Knuijt who died 1681; her daughter, Magdalena van Ruijven; and Magdalena's husband, Jacob Abrahamsz Dissius.

The work of Johannes Vermeer, also known as Jan, is well known for many characteristics that are present in this painting. The use of yellow and blue, female models, and domestic scenes are all signatures of Vermeer. This oil on canvas portrays two women, a Mistress and her Maid, as they look over the Mistress' love letter.\r Johannes Vermeer was born in 1632 in Delft, Holland. He worked and lived in Delft all his life, although it is possible that he may have done an apprenticeship in another town such as Amsterdam or Utrecht for six years. A major stepping point in Vermeer's career was in 1653 when he joined the Guild of Saint Luke as a master and professional painter. Vermeer painted at a somewhat leisure pace, producing two to three paintings a year and there are 35 known to exist today. Vermeer's work shows that he was most likely a fan of the camera obscura, as parts are in focus as others slightly blur. There is also an intensity to his colors that supports the use of the obscura. Vermeer died at a relatively young age, 43, in 1675. He suffered most likely from a stroke or stress-induced heart attack. The slow rate at which he produced paintings restricted Vermeer from becoming wealthy during his lifetime, and he died in debt.\r Mistress and Maid was painted over the years 1666\u20131667 on a canvas. The painting shows an elegant mistress and her maid as they look over a love letter that the mistress just received. There are prominent Vermeer styles presented in this painting. There is a strong use of yellow in the woman's elegant fur-lined overcoat, and blue in the silk tablecloth and the maid's apron. The focus of the painting is the two women as they are sitting at a desk, doing an everyday activity. Vermeer was known for his domestic scenes containing women. The light in the painting comes from the left, and falls on the mistress' face, as is apparent from the shadow of the table on her legs. This painting can seem very straightforward at first glance, but it has deeper psychological implications. If one looks at the image straightforwardly, one sees the mistress as she looks at the sealed love letter, hinting that she has a relationship with someone who is perhaps a great distance away. There is a hinted relationship between the maid and the mistress with their furtive glances and their body language, as they lean towards each other. The mistress has a pensive gaze, with her lips parted ever so slightly and her fingertips lifted to her chin in a questioning manner. The mistress' profile is slightly blurred and undefined and is meant to portray an idea that the woman is soft and sweet like another of Vermeer's paintings, Girl with a Pearl Earring. The painting is preserved well and it has stylistic features such as the large scale of the figures, the dark background, and the dramatic modeling within the scene. In Mistress and Maid, Vermeer played with his medium and created texture and light with his works. For example, the lighted parts of the yellow overcoat are formed with sweeping brushstrokes of lead-tin-yellow and the shadows are created with definition. Dark backgrounds were used in portraiture after Leonardo da Vinci created the trend. They were used because they gave focus to the person in the portrait and enhanced the three-dimensional effect. Vermeer uses dark backgrounds in his other portraits such as Portrait of a Young Woman and Girl with a Pearl Earring. There is a prominent usage of pearls on the mistress in this painting. Pearls were an important status symbol of the period and that was reflected in the mistress' fancy attire and her abundance of pearls. A prevalent theme in Vermeer's paintings from around the late 1660s is letter writings. In earlier works, there is one woman isolated with a letter, but in this painting the added maid is a new element. This gives the painting a sense of anxiousness between the two women over the letter and its potential contents.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: Study of a young woman\nArtwork Genre: portrait,tronie\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/study-of-a-young-woman\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of a Young Woman (also known as Study of a Young Woman, or Girl with a Veil) is a painting by the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer, completed between 1666 and 1667, and now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\r Because of its near-identical size and its proximity in tone and composition, it is often considered to be either a variant or pendant painting (counterpart) of the artist's better-known Girl with a Pearl Earring. The subjects of both paintings wear pearl earrings, have scarves draped over their shoulders, and are shown in front of a plain black background. In addition, it is likely that the creation of both works involved the use of a camera obscura.\r The sitter is depicted as having a homely face, a wide-spaced and flat face, small nose and thin lips. This apparent lack of idealised beauty has led to a general belief that this work was painted on commission, although it is possible that the model was the artist's daughter. The artist probably used a live model but, as with Girl with a Pearl Earring did not create the work as a portrait, but a tronie, a Dutch word meaning \"visage\" or \"expression\", a type of Dutch 17th-century picture appreciated for its \"unusual costumes, intriguing physiognomies, suggestion of personality, and demonstration of artistic skill.\" The picture encourages the viewer to be curious about the young woman's thoughts, feelings, or character, something typical in many of Vermeer's paintings.\r Girl with a Pearl Earring and Portrait of a Young Woman are unusual for Vermeer in that they lack his usual rich background; instead the girls are framed by a background of deep black. This isolating effect seems to heighten their vulnerability and seeming desire to place trust in the viewer. In 1994, the art historian Edward Snow wrote that Portrait of a Young Woman conveys \"the desire for beauty and perfection into a loving acceptance of what is flawed.\"\r The painting may have been owned by Pieter Claesz van Ruijven of Delft before 1674, then by his widow, Maria de Knuijt of Delft, until 1681; then their daughter, Magdalena van Ruijven, until 1682; her widower, Jacob Dissius, until 1695. The painting is thought to have been part of the Dissius sale of May 16, 1696 (No. 38, 39 or 40). It probably then belonged to Dr. Luchtmans, who sold it in Rotterdam as part of a sale from April 20\u201322, 1816 (No. 92) for 3 Dutch guilders (about 30 grams of silver), even then a tiny amount. Prince Auguste Marie Raymond d'Arenberg, of Brussels, owned the painting by 1829, and it remained in his family, in Brussels and Schloss Meppen, from 1833 to the early 1950s. In 1959 (or 1955, according to another source), it was bought in a private sale from the Prince d'Arenberg by Mr. Charles Wrightsman and Mrs. Jayne Wrightsman of New York for a sum estimated at around \u00a3125,000. In 1979, the Wrightsmans donated the picture to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in memory of curator Theodore Rousseau, Jr.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: The Art of Painting\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/the-art-of-painting\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Art of Painting, also known as The Allegory of Painting, or Painter in his Studio, is a 17th-century oil on canvas painting by Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. It is owned by the Austrian Republic and is on display in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.\r This illusionistic painting is one of Vermeer's most famous. In 1868 Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger, known today for his rediscovery of the work of painter Johannes Vermeer, regarded this painting as his most interesting. Svetlana Alpers describes it as unique and ambitious; Walter Liedtke \"as a virtuoso display of the artist's power of invention and execution, staged in an imaginary version of his studio ...\" According to Albert Blankert \"No other painting so flawlessly integrates naturalistic technique, brightly illuminated space, and a complexly integrated composition.\"\r Many art historians think that it is an allegory of painting, hence the alternative title of the painting. Its composition and iconography make it the most complex Vermeer work of all. After Vermeer's Christ in the House of Martha and Mary it is his largest work.\r The painting depicts an artist painting a woman dressed in blue posing as a model in his studio. The subject is standing by a window and a large map of the Low Countries hangs on the wall behind. It is signed to the right of the girl \"I [Oannes] Ver. Meer\", but not dated. Most experts assume it was executed sometime between 1665/1668, but some suggest the work could have been created as late as 1670\u20131675.\r In 1663 Vermeer had been visited by Balthasar de Monconys, but had no painting to show, so it was possibly done \"in order to have an outstanding specimen of his art in his studio.\" Vermeer obviously liked the painting; he never sold it during his lifetime. According to Alpers \"it stands as a kind of summary and assessment of what has been done.\"\r The painting has only two figures, the painter and his subject, a woman with downcast eyes. The painter was thought to be a self-portrait of the artist; Jean-Louis Vaudoyer suggested the young woman could be his daughter. The painter sits in front of the painting on the easel, where you can see the sketch of the crown. He is dressed in an elegant black garment with cuts on the sleeves and on the back that offers a glimpse of the shirt underneath. He has short puffy breeches and orange stockings, an expensive and fashionable garment that is also found in other works of the time, as in a well-known self-portrait by Rubens.\r The tapestry and the chair, both repoussoirs, lead the viewer into the painting. As in The Allegory of Faith the ceiling can be seen.\r Experts attribute symbols to various aspects of the painting. A number of the items, a plaster mask, perhaps representing the debate on paragone, the presence of a piece of cloth, a folio, and some leather on the table have been linked to the symbols of Liberal Arts. The representation of the marble tiled floor and the splendid golden chandelier are examples of Vermeer's craftsmanship and show his knowledge of perspective. Each object reflects or absorbs light differently, getting the most accurate rendering of material effects.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: The astronomer\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/the-astronomer-1668\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Astronomer is a painting finished in about 1668 by the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. It is oil on canvas, 51\u00a0cm x 45\u00a0cm (20 x 18 in), and is on display at the Louvre, in Paris, France.\r Portrayals of scientists were a favourite topic in 17th-century Dutch painting and Vermeer's oeuvre includes both this astronomer and the slightly later The Geographer. Both are believed to portray the same man, possibly Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. A 2017 study indicated that the canvas for the two works came from the same bolt of material, confirming their close relationship.\r The astronomer's profession is shown by the celestial globe (version by Jodocus Hondius) and the book on the table, the 1621 edition of Adriaan Metius's Institutiones Astronomicae Geographicae. Symbolically, the volume is open to Book III, a section advising the astronomer to seek \"inspiration from God\" and the painting on the wall shows the Finding of Moses\u2014Moses may represent knowledge and science (\"learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians\").\r The provenance of The Astronomer can be traced back to 27 April 1713, when it was sold at the Rotterdam sale of an unknown collector (possibly Adriaen Paets\u00a0(nl) or his father, of Rotterdam) together with The Geographer. The presumed buyer was Hendrik Sorgh, whose estate sale held in Amsterdam on 28 March 1720 included both The Astronomer and The Geographer, which were described as \u2018Een Astrologist: door Vermeer van Delft, extra puyk\u2019 (An Astrologist by Vermeer of Delft, topnotch) and \u2018Een weerga, van ditto, niet minder\u2019 (Similar by ditto, no less).\r Between 1881 and 1888 it was sold by the Paris art dealer L\u00e9on Gauchez to the banker and art collector Alphonse James de Rothschild, after whose death it was inherited by his son, \u00c9douard Alphonse James de Rothschild. In 1940 it was seized from his hotel in Paris by the Nazi Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg f\u00fcr die Besetzten Gebiete after the German invasion of France. A small swastika was stamped on the back in black ink. The painting was returned to the Rothschilds after the war, and was acquired by the French state as giving in payment of inheritance taxes in 1983 and then exhibited at the Louvre since 1983.\r Institutiones Astronomicae Geographicae by Adriaan Metius\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: The Geographer\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/the-geographer\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Geographer is a painting created by Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer in 1668\u20131669, and is now in the collection of the St\u00e4delsches Kunstinstitut museum in Frankfurt, Germany. It is closely related to Vermeer's The Astronomer, for instance using the same model in the same dress, and has sometimes been considered a pendant painting to it. A 2017 study indicated that the canvas for the two works came from the same bolt of material.\r This is one of only three paintings Vermeer signed and dated (the other two are The Astronomer and The Procuress).\r The geographer, dressed in a Japanese-style robe then popular among scholars, is shown to be \"someone excited by intellectual inquiry\", with his active stance, the presence of maps, charts, a globe and books, as well as the dividers he holds in his right hand, according to Arthur Wheelock Jr. \"The energy in this painting [...] is conveyed most notably through the figure's pose, the massing of objects on the left side of the composition, and the sequence of diagonal shadows on the wall to the right.\"\r Vermeer made several changes in the painting that enhance the feeling of energy in the picture: the man's head was originally in a different position to the left of where the viewer now sees it, indicating the man perhaps was looking down, rather than peering out the window; the dividers he holds in his hand were originally vertical, not horizontal; a sheet of paper was originally on the small stool at the lower right, and removing it probably made that area darker.\r Details of the man's face are slightly blurred, suggesting movement (also a feature of Vermeer's Mistress and Maid), according to Serena Carr. His eyes are narrowed, perhaps squinting in the sunlight or an indication of intense thinking. Carr asserts that the painting depicts a \"flash of inspiration\" or even \"revelation\". The drawn curtain on the left and the position of the oriental carpet on the table\u2014pushed back\u2014are both symbols of revelation. \"He grips a book as if he's about to snatch it up to corroborate his ideas.\"\r The globe was published in Amsterdam in 1618 by Jodocus Hondius. Terrestrial and celestial globes were commonly sold together, and the celestial globe in The Astronomer \"was also a Hondius (Hendrick rather than Judocus)\", another indication that the two paintings were created as pendant pieces, according to Cant. The globe is turned toward the Indian Ocean, where the Dutch East India Company was then active. Vermeer used an impasto technique to apply pointill\u00e9 dots, not to indicate light reflected more strongly on certain points but to emphasize the dull ochre cartouche \"frame\" printed on the globe. Since the globe can be identified, we know the decorative cartouche includes a plea for information for future editions\u2014reflecting the theme of revelation in the painting.\r The cartographic objects surrounding the man are some of the actual items a geographer would have: the globe, the dividers the man holds, a cross-staff (hung on the center post of the window), used to measure the angle of celestial objects like the sun or stars, and the chart the man is using, which (according to one scholar, James A. Welu) appears to be a nautical chart on vellum. The sea chart on the wall of \"all the Sea coasts of Europe\" has been identified as one published by Willem Jansz Blaeu. This accuracy indicates Vermeer had a source familiar with the profession. The Astronomer, which seems to form a pendant with this painting, shows a similar, sophisticated knowledge of cartographic instruments and books, and the same young man modeled for both. That man himself may have been the source of Vermeer's correct display of surveying and geographical instruments, and possibly of his knowledge of perspective.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: The Love Letter\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/the-love-letter\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Love Letter (Dutch: De liefdesbrief) is a 17th-century genre painting by Jan Vermeer. The painting shows a servant maid handing a letter to a young woman with a cittern. The painting is in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.\r The tied-up curtain in the foreground creates the impression that the viewer is looking at an intensely private, personal scene. There is also an element of trompe l'oeil as Dutch paintings were often hung with little curtains to conserve them, and the device of painted curtains is seen in other Dutch works of the period. The diagonals on the chequered floor create the impression of depth and three-dimensionality. The fact that it is a love letter that the woman has received is made clear by the fact that she is carrying a lute (more specifically, a cittern, a member of the lute/guitar family). The lute was a symbol of love - often carnal love; luit was also a slang term for vagina. This idea is further reinforced by the slippers at the very bottom of the picture. The removed slipper was another symbol of sex. The floor brush would appear to represent domesticity, and its placement at the side of the painting may suggest that domestic concerns have been forgotten or pushed aside.\r The colors blue and gold are important in the composition of the painting - the gold is located on the woman's dress, the top of the fireplace, and many of the objects, which complements the blue on the floor, the maid's dress, the picture frames, etc. Classical influence is also apparent in the ionic columns of the fireplace.\r The two paintings on the wall are also significant. The lower painting is of a stormy sea, a clear metaphor for tempestuous love. Above it is a landscape painting of a traveler on a sandy road. This may refer to the absence of the man who is writing to the lady.\r In the second half of the 17th century, the painting probably found its place in the collection of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth's monarch John III Sobieski. The 1696 inventory of the Wilan\u00f3w Palace in Warsaw lists among Dutch paintings \"a painting of a lady, playing a lute in a golden robe, while a girl gives her a letter in the black frames (obraz damy, graj\u0105cej na lutni w z\u0142otej szacie, a dziewczyna list jey oddaje w ramach czarnych)\".\r On September 23, 1971, the painting was stolen from its display at The Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels, where it was on loan from the Rijksmuseum. The thief, 21-year-old Mario Pierre Roymans, had locked himself in an electrical closet till the museum was closed. He then took the painting off the wall and tried to escape out of a window. However, when the frame failed to fit through the window, he cut the canvas from its frame with a potato peeler and hid the strip in his back pocket. Roymans first concealed the painting in his room at his place of work, The Soetewey (or Soete-Wey) Hotel. Later he buried it in a forest, but when it started to rain, he recovered it and hid it in his room inside his pillowcase.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: Lady Writing a Letter with Her Maid\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/lady-writing-a-letter-with-her-maid\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLady Writing a Letter with her Maid is a painting by the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer, completed in 1670\u20131671 and held in the National Gallery of Ireland. The work shows a middle-class woman attended by a housemaid who is presumably acting as messenger and go-between for the lady and her lover. The work is seen as a bridge between the quiet restraint and self-containment of Vermeer's work of the 1660s and his relatively cooler work of the 1670s. It may have been partly inspired by Ter Borch's painting Woman Sealing a Letter. The painting's canvas was almost certainly cut from the same bolt used for Woman with a Lute.\r Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid is the first of the artist's experiments with centrifugal composition; where the focus is not only from the center of the canvas. In addition, it is his third work in which the drama and dynamic is not centered on a single figure. The maid is shown standing in the mid-ground, behind her lady, with her hands crossed and waiting for the letter to be completed. The positions of their bodies indicate that the two women are disconnected. The folded arms of the maid seem outwardly as an attempt to display a sense of self-containment, however she is detached from her lady both emotionally and psychologically. The maid's gaze towards the half-visible window indicates an inner restlessness and boredom, as she waits impatiently for the messenger to carry her lady's letter away. Some art historians dispute the absoluteness of this view; according to Pascal Bonafoux, while complicity is not \"indicated by a look or a smile\" from either woman, the mere fact of her presence during such an intimate act as the composition of a love letter indicates at least a degree of intimacy between the two.\r The painting visits many of Vermeer's usual painterly motifs; in particular his obsession with the inside/outside axis of interior spaces, and through his description of the tiled floor as well as the verticals of the dresses, window frame and back wall painting, his interest in geometry and abstract form. Vermeer had experimented with this painterly device earlier in his career, notably in his View of Delft, The Lacemaker and The Art of Painting.\r Lady Writing was stolen on 27 April 1974, along with a Goya, two Gainsboroughs and three Rubens from the Russborough House home of Sir Alfred Beit by armed members of the IRA. Led by the British heiress Dr. Rose Dugdale, the thieves used screwdrivers to cut the paintings from their frames. However, the Vermeer and other works were recovered eight days later at a cottage in County Cork. The work was again taken in 1986 by a gang led by the Dublin gangster Martin Cahill. Along with a number of other art-works, Cahill held the painting for a ransom of \u00a320 million. However, the money was not paid, and Cahill lacked contacts or knowledge to otherwise pass it on to international art thieves. According to an Radio Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann report, Cahill's taste in art extended only to \"cheery scenes like the cheap print in his living room of swans on a river, but he believed the stolen masterpieces would bring him a fortune.\" The painting was eventually recovered during an August 1993 exchange at Antwerp airport which turned out to be a sting operation organised by the Irish police. It had already been donated in absentia to the National Gallery in Dublin.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: The Lacemaker\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/the-lacemaker\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Lacemaker is a painting by the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer (1632\u20131675), completed around 1669\u20131670 and held in the Louvre, Paris. The work shows a young woman dressed in a yellow shawl, holding up a pair of bobbins in her left hand as she carefully places a pin in the pillow on which she is making her bobbin lace. At 24.5\u00a0cm x 21\u00a0cm (9.6 in x 8.3 in), the work is the smallest of Vermeer's paintings, but in many ways one of his most abstract and unusual. The canvas used was cut from the same bolt as that used for A Young Woman Seated at the Virginals, and both paintings seem to have had identical dimensions originally.\r The girl is set against a blank wall, probably because the artist sought to eliminate any external distractions from the central image. As with his The Astronomer (1668) and The Geographer (1669), it is obvious that the artist undertook careful study before he executed the work; the art of lacemaking is portrayed closely and accurately. Vermeer probably used a camera obscura while composing the work: many optical effects typical of photography can be seen, in particular the blurring of the foreground. By rendering areas of the canvas as out-of-focus, Vermeer is able to suggest depth of field in a manner unusual of Dutch Baroque painting of the era.\r In The Lacemaker, the artist presents in an abstract manner the various elements which compose the girl's face and body and the pattern of the material on which she is working. The girl's hands, the curls of her hair and the T-cross which form her eyes and nose are all described in an abstract manner unusual for the era in which Vermeer worked. In addition, the red and white of the lace is shown as spilling from the sewing cushion with physical properties suggesting a near liquid form. The blurring of these threads contrasts sharply with the precision of the lace she is shown working on.\r Vermeer's painting is often compared to a 1662 canvas of the same name by the Dutch portrait and genre painter Caspar Netscher. However, Vermeer's work is very different in tone. In the earlier work, both the girl's shoes and the mussel shells near her feet have sexual connotations. In addition, the discarded shoes in Netscher's painting are unlikely to be the girl's own, hinting again at a sexual overtone.\r According to the art historian Lawrence Gowing,\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: A Lady Standing at a Virginal\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/a-lady-standing-at-a-virginal\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLady Standing at a Virginal is a genre painting created by the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer in about 1670\u20131672, now in the National Gallery, London.\r The oil painting depicts a richly dressed woman playing a virginal in a home with a tiled floor, paintings on the wall and some of the locally manufactured Delftware blue and white tiles of a type that appear in other Vermeer works.\r The identities of the paintings on the wall are not certain, according to the National Gallery, but the landscape on the left may be by either Jan Wijnants or Allart van Everdingen. The second painting, showing Cupid holding a card, is attributed to Caesar van Everdingen, Allart's brother. This motif originated in a contemporary emblem and may either represent the idea of faithfulness to a single lover or perhaps, reflecting the presence of the virginal, the traditional association of music and love.\r The painting has been dated on stylistic grounds and on the evidence of the costume. This work can be related to another Vermeer in the collection, Lady Seated at a Virginal, on a canvas of almost exactly the same size, with which it may form a pair. A recent study has shown that the canvas for the two paintings came from the same bolt. In addition, the ground applied to the canvas of each painting appears to be identical and also to be shared with the New York Young Woman Seated at the Virginals.\r The painting is depicted in David Hockney's 1977 oil painting 'Looking at Pictures on a Screen'.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: A young woman seated at a virginal (A Lady Seated at a Virginal)\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/a-young-woman-seated-at-a-virginal-a-lady-seated-at-a-virginal\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLady Seated at a Virginal, also known as Young Woman Seated at a Virginal, is a genre painting created by Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer in about 1670\u201372 and now in the National Gallery, London.\r Another painting, probably also by Johannes Vermeer known as A Young Woman Seated at the Virginals, belongs to a private collection shows also a young woman seated at a Virginal. This painting and Lady Seated at a Virginal are quite separate works and are each known by alternate names and confusion between those two pieces may exist.\r The picture shows a woman facing left and playing a virginal. In the left foreground is a viola da gamba holding a bow between its strings. A landscape is painted on the inside lid of the virginal, and the painting on the wall is either the original or a copy of The Procuress by Dirck van Baburen (now in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston), which belonged to Vermeer's mother-in-law. Vermeer had already featured this painting in The Concert, perhaps six years earlier. It is unclear whether or how much the subject of The Procuress is intended to reflect on the meaning of this work, although \"It is probable that a more general association between music and love is intended.\" At the upper left, a tapestry is used to frame the scene, and in the lower right the foot of the back wall is decorated with Delft tiles.\r Because of its style, the painting has been dated to about 1670. It has been suggested that it and Lady Standing at a Virginal (also owned by the National Gallery) may have been created as pendants, because their sizes, date and subject matter are all similar. A recent study has shown that the canvas for the two paintings came from the same bolt. In addition, the ground applied to the canvas appears identical to that used for both the Lady Standing and the New York Young Woman Seated. However their provenances before the 19th century differ, and Vermeer sometimes varied a theme in otherwise unrelated paintings. In the 19th century, both paintings were owned by the art critic Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9, whose writings led to a resurgence of interest in Vermeer starting in 1866.

A series of technical examinations from 1993 onwards confirmed the attribution. It is thought to date from c.1670 and is now in part of the Leiden Collection in New York. It should not be confused with Young Woman Seated at a Virginal in the National Gallery, London, also by Vermeer.\r The painting's early provenance is unclear, though possibly it was owned in Vermeer's lifetime by Pieter van Ruijven and later inherited by Jacob Dissius. By 1904 it was one of two Vermeers owned by Alfred Beit, the other being Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid. It remained in the Beit family until sold to Baron Rolin in 1960. The painting was not widely known until described in the catalogue of the Beit collection published in 1904. In the first decades following 1904 it was widely accepted as a Vermeer. Then in the mid-twentieth century, as some \"Vermeers\" were discovered to be forgeries by Han van Meegeren and doubt was cast on others, it fell from favour.\r In 1993 Baron Rolin asked Sotheby's to conduct research into the painting. A series of technical examinations followed, which have convinced most experts that it is a Vermeer, though probably one that was reworked in parts after the painter's death. Rolin's heirs sold the painting through Sotheby's in 2004 to Steve Wynn for $30 million. It was later purchased for the Leiden Collection owned by Thomas Kaplan. It has appeared in several Vermeer exhibitions in recent years, in the United States, Britain, Japan, Italy and France.\r The painting originally had the same dimensions as Vermeer's Lacemaker. Tentative evidence that the canvas was cut from the same bolt as the Lacemaker, which was gathered in the 1990s, was strengthened by a later, more sophisticated study. The ground appears identical to that used for the two Vermeers owned by London's National Gallery. X-ray examination has revealed evidence of a pin-hole at the vanishing point, as habitually used by Vermeer in conjunction with a thread to achieve correct perspective in his paintings. Pigments are used in the painting in a way typical of Vermeer, most notably the expensive ultramarine as a component in the background wall. The use of green earth in shadows is also distinctive. The use of lead-tin-yellow suggests that the painting cannot be a nineteenth- or twentieth-century fake or imitation. Examination of the cloak, often cited as the crudest part of the painting, shows that it was painted over another garment after some time had elapsed. It is not known how long this gap was, or if Vermeer was responsible for the repainting.\r The hairstyle can be dated to c.1670, and matches the hairstyle in the Lacemaker, which on other grounds is also often dated to the same period. It is not clear if the painting was completed before or after the similar but more ambitious Young Woman Seated at a Virginal in the National Gallery, London. The painting is unsigned.\n", "\nArtist: Johannes Vermeer\nArtwork Name: Youg woman playing a guitar\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/youg-woman-playing-a-guitar\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Guitar Player is a 1672 painting by Jan Vermeer, on display in Kenwood House, London as part of the Iveagh Bequest.

The painting is currently located at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and has been since 1931.\r This and Art of Painting are his only works that fall under history painting in the contemporary hierarchy of genres, though they still have his typical composition of one or two figures in a domestic interior. (The Art of Painting is Vermeer's only other allegory, painted earlier than Allegory of Faith.) Both share several features: the perspective is almost the same, and at the left of each painting is a multicolor tapestry pulled to the left to disclose the scene. The Art of Painting also uses symbolism from Cesare Ripa (of Clio, muse of history). Vermeer's Love Letter uses the same or a similar gilt panel. The Allegory and The Art of Painting differ markedly in style and purpose from Vermeer's other works. Both allegorical paintings show complex meaning, but Allegory of Faith \"reveals that the artist's usual focus on naturalistic effects was a stylistic option, to be set aside when the subject called for another approach\". The Art of Painting still reads as a naturalistic depiction of an artist and his model, and the pose of the model is simple, whereas the pose of the figure in The Allegory of Faith is Baroquely dramatic.\r The painting depicts a woman in a fine white and blue satin dress with gold trimmings. She sits on a platform a step higher than the black and white marble floor, her right foot on a terrestrial globe and her right hand on her heart as she looks up, adoringly, at a glass sphere hung from the ceiling by a blue ribbon. Her left arm rests on the edge of a table which holds a golden chalice, a large book, and a dark-wood crucifix. Behind the crucifix is a gilt-leather panel screen. Beneath the book is a long piece of cloth, possibly a priest's stole. Resting on top of the book is a crown of thorns. All of these items are on the platform, which is covered by a green and yellow rug, the edge of which is on the floor. At the bottom of the picture, nearer the viewer, is an apple, and nearer still a snake which has been squashed by a cornerstone. On the dim, far wall behind the woman, a large painting of Christ's crucifixion is hung on the wall behind the woman. To the viewer's left is a multicolored tapestry, pulled back at the bottom and seemingly the closest thing in the painting to the viewer. A chair with a blue cloth on it is immediately beneath and behind the tapestry and to the left of the snake and cornerstone.\r Vermeer's iconography in the painting is largely taken from Cesare Ripa's Iconologia, an emblem book (a collection of allegorical illustrations with accompanying morals or poems on a moral theme) which had been translated into Dutch in 1644 by D. P. Pers. The artist used various symbols that Ripa described and illustrated in his book, along with symbols taken from other books and traditions. Two of the four allegorical figures of Faith (\"Fede. Geloof\" and \"Fede Catholica. Catholijck of algemeen Geloof\") given in Ripa's book provide many of the symbols in the painting, including the color of the woman's clothing, her hand gesture, and the presence of the crushed snake and the apple.\n", "\nArtist: Tintoretto\nArtwork Name: Battle of Asola\nArtwork Genre: battle painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/tintoretto/battle-of-asola\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Siege of Asola is a painting by the Italian late Renaissance master Tintoretto, executed in 1544-1545.

The scene comes from a passage in John 13 where before the Last Supper Christ washes the feet of his disciples. This passage called for a complex image with many characters in a variety of poses and motions, and the diversity and challenge attracted Tintoretto. The paintings were commissioned for various churches of Venice, though since then four of the six have left Italy.\r The painting was created between 1548 and 1549 and was a companion piece to Tintoretto's Last Supper, which still hangs at San Marcuola in Venice. Christ and St. Peter are at the far right of the image, an unusual position as Christ was typically placed in the centre of any paintings. This is explained by its original positioning in the church on the right side of the altar. Viewing the painting from a side angle allows the perspective of the tiled floor and the gaze of the disciples towards Jesus to emphasise his status as the main subject of the painting. On the far left of the painting is Judas Iscariot, clothed in bright red and noticeably isolated from the other figures of the painting. In the middle of the work are the rest of the disciples gathered around the table that was the site of the supper. They are depicted somewhat humorously as they strive to pull off their stockings. In the background there is a portal above Jesus that opens up to a room where the last supper takes place. The opening to the left shows buildings with elaborate and fantastic architecture. The architecture is based closely on designs by Sebastiano Serlio.\r It was originally commissioned for the church San Marcuola and is usually believed to be hanging today in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. The painting was removed from San Marcuola by the mid-seventeenth century as attested by Carlo Ridolfi. To replace it, Ridolfi himself painted a copy of the painting and this copy remains at San Marcuola. The precise history of the painting is unclear, but it is perhaps the one that is recorded as being part of the collection of King Charles I of England. With the English Civil War much of Charles collection was broken up, and the Tintoretto was purchased 1654 by Luis M\u00e9ndez de Haro, who gave it to Philip IV of Spain from whom it eventually became part of the Prado's collection.\r There is also a version at the Shipley Art Gallery that has the same overall design as the Prado painting, but varies in many small details. There is debate among scholars over how much of these two works were actually done by Tintoretto and how much was done by his workshop assistants. There is also evidence to suggest that the Shipley Art Gallery may in fact own the original:\r 'It is now considered that the version in the Shipley is the original painting from St. Marcuola. It was moved from the church by 1648, and next heard of when it was put up for auction on 2 June 1814 at Phillips in London by Alexis Delahante, a French dealer and entrepreneur who was returning to live in Paris.

Robusti, also known as Tintoretto or Il\u00a0Furioso, for the energy and \"fury\" with which he painted, depicted both sacred and profane subjects in a period known as the Venetian \u201cgolden century\u201d.\r Susanna and the Elders (c.\u00a01555\u201356) depicts a scene from the biblical episode of Susanna, from the Book of Daniel.\r The painting shows Susanna, a young married woman, sitting on the edge of a small pool, preparing to take a bath. She is watched by two elderly men, acquaintances of her husband, who desire her. The lustful elders are depicted in the painting hiding behind a rose trellis in her garden. They are watching and spying on her, trying to find an opportunity to catch her alone in the garden.\r The story of Susanna and the elders was frequently depicted in art history. The painting is full of symbols. The objects beside the main figure included white pearls, silver jewelry, a silk shawl, and a silver jug. The painting is considered one of Tintoretto's \"masterpieces\".\r According to the story, a young married Jewish woman named Susanna bathed in a pool in her garden every day. One day, two elderly men who were guests of Susanna's wealthy husband Joakim, lusted for Susanna, who was described as \"The Beautiful Susanna\". The elders\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who were judges and respectable members of the community\u00a0\u2013\u00a0came to an agreement that they would wait until Susanna was alone in the garden and then have their way with her. After Susanna sent away her maids to fetch fragrant oils and perfumes for her bath, the two men rushed forward, propositioning her to have sex with them. They threatened to denounce her if she rejected their advances.\r Susanna rejected their proposal. The two prominent elders of the community then publicly denounced her, falsely accusing her of committing adultery with a young man. According to ancient Jewish law, adultery was punishable by death, and Susanna was condemned to death after everyone believed the two judges' story. Upset and crying, Susanna was taken away to be executed. She turned to God, calling upon him to prove her innocence. A young man named Daniel was standing in the crowd watching. While witnessing the procession Daniel heard the voice of an angel. The angel urged him to speak up and prevent the killing of an innocent woman who was being framed for doing something she had not done. (The young Daniel would later be known as the prophet Daniel.) The young man, surprised, felt obliged to halt the execution. He asked to be allowed to interrogate the two elders separately so that they could not speak to each other. Daniel then cross-examined the judges on how they had discovered Susanna, what the young man looked like, where they secretly met and so on. He kept receiving contradictory answers from the elders. When asked under which tree Susanna had committed adultery, the two elders gave very different answers and named different kinds of trees. The elderly judges were exposed for lying and for bearing false witness\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a capital crime according to ancient Jewish law. Daniel proved Susanna was innocent, and she was freed while the elders were condemned.\n", "\nArtist: Tintoretto\nArtwork Name: Saint George and the Dragon\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/tintoretto/saint-george-and-the-dragon\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint George and the Dragon or Saint George Killing the Dragon is a 1555 or 1558 painting by the Venetian artist Tintoretto.

In the left foreground, the standing luminous saint himself with a faint halo appears and beseeches them to stop, because his body has been found and lies pale at his feet, strewn on an oriental rug. In the center of the canvas, an elder (portrait of Rangone) kneels acknowledging the miracle. Elsewhere in the room, the figures are either astonished or oblivious to the apparition.\r In places, the work appears unfinished: the tiles of floor and cornices is visible through some clothing and figures. The foreshortening is accentuated by the tiles, and the wall tombs, and finally by rays of light seeming to emerge from the crypt in the background. In the foreground at the right, a contorted half-naked man is described as \"possessed by demons\", above him hover strands of smoke. Other quizzical markings occur on the ceilings.\r Like its companion piece, St Mark's Body Brought to Venice, the composition exemplifies Tintoretto's preference for dramatic effects of perspective and light. According to the art historian Thomas Nichols, \"the linear logic of the emptied, boxlike perspective vistas is undermined by an irrational play of light and shade.

An oil painting on canvas executed in 1592\u201394, it is housed in the Basilica di San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice, northern Italy.\r Tintoretto depicted the Last Supper several times during his artistic career. His earlier paintings for the Chiesa di San Marcuola (1547) and for the Chiesa di San Felice (1559) depict the scene from a frontal perspective, with the figures seated at a table placed parallel to the picture plane. This follows a convention observed in most paintings of the Last Supper, of which Leonardo da Vinci's late 1490s mural painting in Milan, Italy, is perhaps the best-known example.\r Tintoretto's painting of 1592\u201394, a work of his final years, departs drastically from this compositional formula. The centre of the scene is occupied not by the apostles but instead by secondary characters, such as a woman carrying a dish and the servants taking the dishes from the table. The table at which the apostles sit recedes into space on a steep diagonal. Also personal is Tintoretto's use of light, which appears to come into obscurity from both the light on the ceiling and from Jesus' aureola. A host of angels hover above the scene.\r Tintoretto's Last Supper makes use of Mannerist devices, notably its complex and radically asymmetrical composition. In its dynamism and emphasis on the quotidian\u2014the setting is similar to a Venetian inn\u2014the painting points the way to the Baroque. \"The ability of this dramatic scene to engage viewers was well in keeping with Counter-Reformation ideals and the Catholic Church's belief in the didactic nature of religious art.\"\n", "\nArtist: Henri Rousseau\nArtwork Name: Tiger in a Tropical Storm (Surprised!)\nArtwork Genre: wildlife painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-rousseau/tiger-in-a-tropical-storm-surprised-1891\n\nWikipedia Article:\nTiger in a Tropical Storm or Surprised! is an 1891 oil-on-canvas painting by Henri Rousseau. It was the first of the jungle paintings for which the artist is chiefly known. It shows a tiger, illuminated by a flash of lightning, preparing to pounce on its prey in the midst of a raging gale.\r Unable to have a painting accepted by the jury of the Acad\u00e9mie de peinture et de sculpture, Rousseau exhibited Tiger in a Tropical Storm in 1891 under the title Surpris!, at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, which was unjuried and open to all artists. The painting received mixed reviews. Rousseau had been a late developer: his first known work, Landscape with a Windmill, was not produced until he was 35, and his work is marked by a na\u00efvet\u00e9 of composition that belies its technical complexity. Most critics mocked Rousseau's work as childish, but F\u00e9lix Vallotton, a young Swiss painter who was later to be an important figure in the development of the modern woodcut, said of it:\r He (Rousseaues tiger) is derived from a motif found in the drawings and paintings of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. It was claimed, either by Rousseau himself or by his friends and admirers, that he had experienced life in the jungle during his time in Mexico in 1860, where he had served as a regimental bandsman. In fact he never left France, and it is thought that his inspiration came from the botanical gardens of Paris, such as the Jardin des Plantes (which included zoological galleries with taxidermy specimens of exotic animals), and from prints and books. The fin de si\u00e8cle French populace was captivated by exotic and dangerous subjects, such as the perceived savagery of animals and peoples of distant lands (Morris & Green, 49\u201360). Tigers on the prowl had been the subject of an exhibition at the 1885 \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. Emmanuel Fr\u00e9miet's famous sculpture of 1887 depicting a gorilla carrying a woman exuded more savagery than anything in Rousseau's canvases, yet was found acceptable as art; Rosseau's poor immediate reception therefore seems the result of his style and not his subject matter (Morris & Green, 143).\r The tiger's prey is beyond the edge of the canvas, so it is left to the imagination of the viewer to decide what the outcome will be, although Rousseau's original title Surprised! suggests the tiger has the upper hand. Rousseau later stated that the tiger was about to pounce on a group of explorers. Despite their apparent simplicity, Rousseau's jungle paintings were built up meticulously in layers, using a large number of green shades to capture the lush exuberance of the jungle. He also devised his own method for depicting the lashing rain by trailing strands of silver paint diagonally across the canvas, a technique inspired by the satin-like finishes of the paintings of William-Adolphe Bouguereau.\r Although Tiger in a Tropical Storm brought him his first recognition, and he continued to exhibit his work annually at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, Rousseau did not return to the jungle theme for another seven years, with the exhibition of Struggle for Life (now lost) at the 1898 Salon. Responses to his work were little changed; following this exhibition, one critic wrote, \"Rousseau continued to express his visions on canvas in implausible jungles... grown from the depths of a lake of absinthe, he shows us the bloody battles of animals escaped from the wooden-horse-maker\" (Morris & Green, 142). Another five years passed before the next jungle scene, Scouts Attacked by a Tiger (1904). The tiger appears in at least three more of his paintings: Tiger Hunt (c. 1895), in which humans are the predators; Jungle with Buffalo Attacked by a Tiger (1908); and Fight Between a Tiger and a Buffalo (1908).\n", "\nArtist: Henri Rousseau\nArtwork Name: The Sleeping Gypsy\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-rousseau/the-sleeping-gypsy-1897\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Sleeping Gypsy (French: La Boh\u00e9mienne endormie) is an 1897 oil painting by French Na\u00efve artist Henri Rousseau (1844\u20131910). It is a fantastical depiction of a lion musing over a sleeping woman on a moonlit night.\r Rousseau first exhibited the painting at the 13th Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, and tried unsuccessfully to sell it to the mayor of his hometown, Laval. Instead, it entered the private collection of a Parisian charcoal merchant where it remained until 1924, when it was discovered by the art critic Louis Vauxcelles. The Paris-based art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler purchased the painting in 1924, although a controversy arose over whether the painting was a forgery. It was acquired by art historian Alfred H. Barr Jr. for the New York Museum of Modern Art.\r Rousseau described his painting as follows: \"A wandering Negress, a mandolin player, lies with her jar beside her (a vase with drinking water), overcome by fatigue in a deep sleep. A lion chances to pass by, picks up her scent yet does not devour her. There is a moonlight effect, very poetic.\"\n", "\nArtist: Henri Rousseau\nArtwork Name: The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope\nArtwork Genre: wildlife painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-rousseau/the-hungry-lion-throws-itself-on-the-antelope-1905\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope (Le lion ayant faim se jette sur l'antilope) is a large oil-on-canvas painting created by Henri Rousseau in 1905. Following Scouts Attacked by a Tiger the previous year, The Hungry Lion was the second jungle painting to mark Rousseau's return to this genre after a 10-year hiatus caused by the generally negative reception to his 1891 painting Tiger in a Tropical Storm.\r The Hungry Lion features a jungle scene of thick green foliage lit by a deep red setting sun. In the foreground, a lion bites deeply into the neck of an antelope. Other animals are visible in the dense undergrowth: a panther watches from the right, an owl stares out of the background holding a bloody strand of meat in its beak in the centre, with a second bird to its left, and dark ape-like shape with gimlet eye lurks to the left. Rousseau based the central pair of animals on a diorama of stuffed animals at the Paris Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle, entitled Senegal Lion Devouring an Antelope.\r Rousseau's first jungle painting, Tiger in a Tropical Storm, was rejected by the Acad\u00e9mie de peinture et de sculpture for their official Paris Salon, but he was able to show it at the 1891 Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants. Despite his increasing reputation, Rousseau continued to exhibit his works at the annual Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, but The Hungry Lion was first shown at a third show, the Salon d'Automne, in 1905, alongside works by Matisse and Derain. Rousseau wrote a longer subtitle or caption to accompany his painting:\r The magazine L'Illustration printed a copy of the work in its edition of 4 November 1905, with works by Matisse, Derain, C\u00e9zanne and Vuillard.\r The avante garde works on display at the 1905 Salon d'Automne were decried by art critic Louis Vauxcelles as, \"Donatello chez les fauves\" (Donatello among the wild beasts), contrasting the paintings with a Renaissance-style sculpture displayed in the same room at the Grand Palais. Vauxcelles\u2019 comment was printed on 17 October 1905 in Gil Blas, a daily newspaper, and the term Fauvism passed into popular usage for the type of work exhibited, of seeming simplicity in vibrant colours. The very term Fauvism may have been influenced directly by Rousseau's The Hungry Lion, although Rousseau was not himself counted as a Fauve.\r Despite their apparent simplicity, Rousseau's jungle paintings were built up meticulously in layers, using a large number of green shades to capture the lush exuberance of the jungle. Rousseau's work continued to be derided by the critics up to and after his death in 1910, but he won a following among his contemporaries: Picasso, Matisse, and Toulouse-Lautrec were all admirers of his work.\r The Hungry Lion is now held by the Fondation Beyeler and is exhibited at their gallery at Riehen, near Basel, in Switzerland.

His last completed work, it was first exhibited at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants from 18 March to 1 May 1910, a few months before his death on 2 September 1910. Rousseau's earlier works had received a negative reception, but poet and critic Guillaume Apollinaire remarked on its debut: \"The picture radiates beauty, that is indisputable. I believe nobody will laugh this year.\"\r The Dream is the largest of the jungle paintings, measuring 6' 8\u00bd\" x 9' 9\u00bd\" (204.5 x 298.5\u00a0cm). It features an almost surreal portrait of Yadwigha (Jadwiga), Rousseau's Polish mistress from his youth, lying naked on a divan to the left of the painting, gazing over a landscape of lush jungle foliage, including lotus flowers, and animals including birds, monkeys, an elephant, a lion and lioness, and a snake. The stylised forms of the jungle plants are based on Rousseau's observations at the Paris Museum of Natural History and its Jardin des Plantes. The nude's left arm reaches towards the lions and a black snake charmer who faces the viewer playing his flute, barely visible in the gloom of the jungle under the dim light of the full moon. A pink-bellied snake slithers through the undergrowth, its sinuous form reflecting the curves of the woman's hips and leg.\r Suspecting that some viewers did not understand the painting, Rousseau wrote a poem to accompany it, Inscription pour La R\u00eave:\r One possible interpretation of the painting, offered by Rousseau in a letter to art critic Andr\u00e9 Dupont, is that it depicts a woman reclining on a couch in Paris, dreaming she is listening to a flute player in the jungle.\r The subject of a reclining nude draws from a classical tradition, from Titian\u2019s 1538 painting Venus of Urbino to Manet's 1863 painting Olympia. Rousseau may have taken some inspiration from \u00c9mile Zola\u2019s novel Le R\u00eave, which deals with the love between a painter and an embroideress. While he was painting The Dream, Rousseau was romantically involved with a shop assistant, Leonie.\r French art dealer Ambroise Vollard bought the painting from Rousseau in February 1910. It was sold through Knoedler Galleries in New York to clothing manufacturer and art collector Sidney Janis in January 1934. Janis sold the painting to Nelson A. Rockefeller in 1954, who donated it to the Museum of Modern Art, New York to celebrate the Museum's 25th anniversary.

It depicts the 81-year-old artist posed in Peale's Museum, then occupying the second floor of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The nearly life-size painting is in the collection of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  Toward the end of his career, beginning in 1822, he painted seven self-portraits that together formed the final motif of his art and the final flourishing of his talent. The Artist in His Museum is a large-scale oil-on-canvas work painted in about two months, and is the most emblematic of Peale's many self-portraits.  Peale was a naturalist as well as a painter. In 1784 he founded the Philadelphia Museum, situated at the time of the painting in the Long Room of the Pennsylvania State House (now Independence Hall). The curation of the museum dominated his career from that point; he would on occasion announce his retirement from painting or his return to it.  In 1822 he was asked by the museum's trustees to paint a full-length portrait of himself for the museum. The artist endeavored to \"not only make it a lasting monument of my art as a Painter, but also that the design should be expressive, that I bring forth into public view, the beauties of Nature and Art, the rise & progress of the Museum.\" He further said, \"I wish it may excite some admiration, otherwise my labor is lost, except that it is a good likeness.\" Peale's determination to honor his career is reflected in his having painted two preliminary versions of The Artist, unusual for an artist who took pride in producing likenesses  with little preparatory work.  There are three spaces in the work. The foreground of the painting depicts in low light some natural objects of the museum. At the front left, a dead wild turkey sits with Peale's taxidermic tools, brought back by his son Titian and waiting to join the collection to reveal its meaning as a national symbol. Another American symbol, the bald eagle, is higher on the left edge of the canvas, mounted by Peale\u2014\"the strength of the Eagles Eye is really astonishing\"\u2014and is now one of his few surviving specimens.  On the extreme left is an early donation: a paddlefish from the Allegheny River in an upright case, marked \"With this article the Museum commenced, June, 1784\". To Peale's left lie the bones of a mastodon; the assembled skeleton that shows from behind the curtain was the museum's main attraction. Peale had unearthed and reconstructed a mastodon in 1800, an event he chronicled in his 1806 painting Exhuming the First American Mastodon (left). The artist's palette and brushes to his left contribute to the autobiographical statement.  The middle ground highlights Peale. In the painting, the artist invites the viewer into his museum; he pulls back a draped crimson curtain, which divides the painting's space, to reveal the collection. He used a similar motif on the printed acknowledgments he sent to museum donors, on which a curtain labeled \"Nature\" is held back to reveal a landscape with animals. According to critic David C. Ward, the positioning of Peale \"has the effect of creating a dialectic between life and art, painter and audience, the individual and American culture at large, and finally past and present. The figure of Peale bridges these realms\u00a0\u2026 further drawing attention to and heightening the impact of his creativity.\"\n", "\nArtist: Gilbert Stuart\nArtwork Name: The Skater (Portrait of William Grant)\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gilbert-stuart/the-skater-portrait-of-william-grant-1782\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Skater is a 1782 oil on canvas portrait of William Grant by the American artist Gilbert Stuart. Painted while Stuart was living in London, it was the work that first brought the artist broad recognition.\r In 1775 Stuart left his home in the United States for London, and by 1777 he was apprenticed there to Benjamin West. By 1781 Stuart's progress was such that West desired to sit for a portrait by the younger painter, and the resulting painting was favorably received at that year's Royal Academy exhibition.\r Later in 1781 Stuart was approached by William Grant, a well-placed young Scotsman from Congalton in East Lothian, not far from Edinburgh, who wished to commission a full-length portrait. Stuart had not yet successfully completed a figure in full-length format\u2014he had, in fact, been loath to accept at least two such previous commissions, and was said to have been incapable of painting a figure \"beneath the fifth button\". Encouraged by the recent reception of his work at the Royal Academy, he agreed to accept the commission from Grant.\r When he arrived to begin sitting for the portrait, Grant remarked that \"on account of the excessive coldness of the weather\u00a0... the day was better suited for skating than sitting for one's portrait\". Presently artist and patron left for the Serpentine in Hyde Park, where the two men took to the ice, and Grant engaged in a series of skating maneuvers that attracted an admiring crowd. When the ice beneath them began to crack, Stuart instructed Grant to take hold of his coattails, and led him safely to shore.\r Upon their return to the studio Stuart started to paint Grant's head directly\u2014he never drew with a pencil\u2014then stopped and suggested a composition inspired by their venture on the ice. Grant consented, and Stuart subsequently rendered the figure from memory.\r With his arms crossed and his head slightly lowered as he skates from right to left, Grant dominates the canvas. The dramatic impression is enhanced by a low point of view, much in the fashion of Baroque portraiture in the Grand Manner. But for his folded arms, Grant's pose derives from the Apollo Belvedere, a cast of which was present in West's studio. The black tones of a full-skirted coat, elegant smallclothes and shoes are relieved by a white cravat and cuff, a gray fur lapel, a glimpse of tan glove, and silver buckles on the hat, breeches, and shoes; the stylishly tilted hat belonged to the artist. Behind Grant is a winter landscape of restrained tones composed of distant skaters, trees, and a far-off London skyline that includes Westminster Abbey. Grant's figure divides the canvas into contrasting halves: to the right the coat's silhouette undulates gently, and a large bare tree anchors the composition, while the left side, opening onto the gestures of skaters in motion, is activated by the shape of his protruding elbow and the jagged contour of coat. Beyond the large tree the recession of the distant treeline creates a movement from right to left which is echoed by the disposition of the secondary figures. The overall handling evidences a lightness of touch and a success in integrating figure and landscape that suggests the open-air portraits of Thomas Gainsborough.\n", "\nArtist: John Trumbull\nArtwork Name: Declaration of Independence\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-trumbull/declaration-of-independence-1819\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe painting Declaration of Independence is a 12-by-18-foot (3.7 by 5.5\u00a0m) oil-on-canvas work by American John Trumbull; it depicts the presentation of the draft of the Declaration of Independence to Congress. It was based on a much smaller version of the same scene, presently held by the Yale University Art Gallery. Trumbull painted many of the figures in the picture from life, and visited Independence Hall to depict the chamber where the Second Continental Congress met. The oil-on-canvas work was commissioned in 1817, purchased in 1819, and placed in the United States Capitol rotunda in 1826.\r The painting is sometimes incorrectly described as the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The painting shows the five-man drafting committee presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Congress, an event that took place on June 28, 1776, and not the signing of the document, which took place later.\r The painting shows 42 of the 56 signers of the Declaration; Trumbull originally intended to include all 56 signers but was unable to obtain likenesses for all of them. He also depicted several participants in the debate who did not sign the document, including John Dickinson, who declined to sign. Trumbull had no portrait of Benjamin Harrison V to work with, but his son Benjamin Harrison VI was said to resemble his father, so Trumbull painted him instead.

Included in the depiction are many leaders of the American troops that took part in the siege.\r Artist John Trumbull (1756\u20131843) spent the early part of the American Revolutionary War as a soldier, serving as an aide to both George Washington and Horatio Gates. After resigning from the army in 1777, he pursued a career as an artist. In 1785 he began sketching out ideas for a series of large-scale paintings to commemorate the major events of the American Revolution. After spending a time in England, he returned to New York City in 1789, where he sketched a number of dignitaries whose portraits he intended to use in these paintings. In 1791 he traveled to Yorktown, Virginia, where he sketched the landscape of the surrender site.\r Upon his return from Britain after the end of the War of 1812, he promoted this idea to the United States Congress. On the strength of his application and the successful exhibition of Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker's Hill, Death of Montgomery, as well as studies for other proposed paintings, the Congress in 1817 voted to commission four large paintings from him, to be hung in the United States Capitol rotunda.\r The price was set at $8,000 per painting, with the size and subject matter to be determined by President James Madison.

Trumbull spent the next eight years executing the commission, completing this painting in 1820. It was displayed in New York City, Boston, and Baltimore before coming to Washington, D. C., and Trumbull supervised its hanging in the Capitol rotunda in late 1820. It has remained there ever since. Trumbull himself cleaned and varnished the painting in 1828, and it has been periodically maintained since. In 1971, damage from a penny that was thrown hard enough to pierce the canvas was repaired. All of the Rotunda paintings were most recently cleaned in 2008.\r The subject of this painting is the surrender of the British army at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781, which ended the last major campaign of the Revolutionary War. The blue sky filled with dark clouds and the broken cannon suggest the battles that led to this event. In early September, entrenched with a force of 7,000 men, Cornwallis had hoped for rescue from the sea, but the British vessels were repelled by a French fleet. Within weeks General Washington had deployed a much larger army, and his artillery bombarded the British positions in early October. After American and French troops overran two British strongholds, Cornwallis surrendered on October 19, 1781.\n", "\nArtist: John Trumbull\nArtwork Name: The Surrender of General Burgoyne\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-trumbull/the-surrender-of-general-burgoyne-1821\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Surrender of General Burgoyne is an oil painting by John Trumbull.

Gates, showing respect for Burgoyne, refuses to take the sword and instead offers hospitality by directing Burgoyne to the tent to take refreshment; the American flag flies in the wind at the top of the tent. (The 2015-D Saratoga National Historical Park quarter shows mainly what did not occur: the handing over and acceptance of the sword.) American officers gather at the sides to witness the event; their varied dress reflects their different units. In the center of the painting, and extending into the background, is Burgoyne's army along with its German reinforcements. They were directed to the camp by American Colonel Lewis, Quartermaster-General, who rides on horseback in the far distance. The scene suggests peace rather than combat or hostility: beneath blue sky and white clouds, officers wear their dress uniforms, weapons are sheathed or slung, and cannons stand silent.\n", "\nArtist: Asher Brown Durand\nArtwork Name: Kindred Spirits\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/asher-brown-durand/kindred-spirits-1849\n\nWikipedia Article:\nKindred Spirits (1849) is a painting by Asher Brown Durand, a member of the Hudson River School of painters. It depicts the painter Thomas Cole, who had died in 1848, and his friend, the poet William Cullen Bryant, in the Catskill Mountains.  The landscape painting, which combines geographical features in Kaaterskill Clove and a minuscule depiction of Kaaterskill Falls, is not a literal depiction of American geography.  Rather, it is an idealized memory of Cole's discovery of the region more than twenty years prior, his friendship with Bryant, and his ideas about American nature.  The painting was commissioned by New York art collector and advocate Jonathan Sturges as a gift to Bryant who in May 1848 had presented an eulogy for the painter Cole (who had unexpectedly died in February of that year). Sturges explained the gift by writing:  Within days of receiving the painting, Bryant wrote thank you notes to both Sturges and Durant expressing his praise for the work. Bryant described his first impression of the gift to Durand, writing, \"I was more delighted with it than I can express, and am under very great obligations to you for having put so much of your acknowledged genius into a work intended for me.\" He continued on to state that \"the painting seems to me in your best manner, which is the highest praise.\" According to Bryant, visitors to his home admired the painting too. \"Every body admires it greatly,\" he wrote, \"and places it high as a work of art.\" A few weeks after the painting was delivered to Bryant, it was exhibited at the National Academy of Design.  While there it received high praise in the press and periodicals. By then it was known as, Kindred Spirits, a title inspired by John Keats' \"Sonnet to Solitude.\"  In 1904, Bryant's daughter Julia donated the painting to the New York Public Library. In 2005, it was sold at auction to Walmart heiress Alice Walton for $35\u00a0million, a record for a painting by an American artist. The Library was criticized for \"jettisoning part of the city's cultural patrimony,\" but the Library defended its move stating it needed the money for its endowment fund. The painting was on display at the National Gallery of Art between 2005 and 2007. Currently, the painting is held in the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas.  At its heart, Kindred Spirits is a memory piece. Durand, a friend of both Cole and Bryant, depicted his friends in their companionate stance in a location they both expressed in their creative pieces. Cole would depict the area beginning in 1826 with his painting Kaaterskill Falls and the area soon became an icon of the burgeoning American landscape painting. Bryant, poet and newspaper editor, would poetically capture the Kaaterskill in his poem \"Caaterskill Falls.\"  Combining two locations--Kaaterskill Falls and the Clove--in an idealized format, the painting illustrates the idea of communing with Nature. As kindred spirits, Cole and Bryant both shared a passion for the American landscape.  In the summer of 1840, Bryant explored the Kaaterskill area of the Catskills with Cole. Standing on the ledge looking out towards the valley, the paintings\u2019 figures of Bryant and Cole illustrate Cole's 1836 description:\n", "\nArtist: Martin Johnson Heade\nArtwork Name: Cattleya Orchid and Three Hummingbirds\nArtwork Genre: flower painting\nArtwork Media: mahogany panel,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/martin-johnson-heade/cattleya-orchid-and-three-hummingbirds-1871\n\nWikipedia Article:\nCattleya Orchid and Three Hummingbirds (1871) is an oil on mahogany panel picture by Martin Johnson Heade acquired by the National Gallery of Art in 1982. Inspired perhaps by the works of Charles Darwin and Frederic Edwin Church, Heade planned to produce a deluxe book in the 1860s depicting Brazilian hummingbirds in tropical settings, and, to that end, created a series of 40 small pictures called The Gems of Brazil. The project was abandoned, but Heade retained his interest in hummingbirds and continued to paint them in combination with orchids and jungle backgrounds through the 1870s. The NGA describes the work: \"Lichen covers dead branches; moss drips from trees; and, a blue-gray mist veils the distant jungle.

Sunlight and Shadow is one of the earliest of Heade's one hundred plus depictions of wetlands.\r The National Gallery writes: \"[Heade] depicted the tides, meteorological phenomena, and other natural forces that shaped the appearance of the swamp and showed how the land was used for hunting, fishing, and the harvesting of naturally occurring salt hay ... the painting's primary motif, sunlight and shadow, seen, for instance, in its intricate cloud shadows and the subtle movement from light to dark across the body of the haystack, informs and unites all its visual elements.\"\n", "\nArtist: Martin Johnson Heade\nArtwork Name: Giant Magnolias on a Blue Velvet Cloth\nArtwork Genre: flower painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/martin-johnson-heade/giant-magnolias-on-a-blue-velvet-cloth-1890\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGiant Magnolias on a Blue Velvet Cloth (1890) is an oil on canvas still-life by Martin Johnson Heade acquired by the National Gallery of Art in 1982. Heade made significant contributions to floral still-life painting during the course of his career, the NGA points out, with Giant Magnolias being one of the finest. Heade married in 1883 and settled in St. Augustine, Florida after a lackluster career as an itinerant artist. He was patronized by Floridian Henry Morrison Flagler, an oil and railroad magnate, who regularly purchased his works. The NGA believes this personal and professional stability stimulated the production of the still-life paintings of Heade's last years.\r The NGA writes, \"Certainly works such as Giant Magnolias on a Blue Velvet Cloth, with their striking contrasts of brilliantly lit flowers and leaves set against a dark background, are among the most original still lifes of the nineteenth century. They are also for many observers strongly sensual, their lush colors, full, curving contours, overall sense of opulence, and implied perfumed scent of the flowers suggestive, perhaps, of female nudes languidly reclining on luxurious couches.\"\n", "\nArtist: James McNeill Whistler\nArtwork Name: Mother of Pearl and Silver: The Andalusian\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/james-mcneill-whistler/mother-of-pearl-and-silver-the-andalusian-1890\n\nWikipedia Article:\nMother of Pearl and Silver: The Andalusian is a painting by James McNeill Whistler. The work shows a woman in full figure standing with her back to the viewer, with her head in profile. The model is Ethel Whibley, (n\u00e9e Birnie Philip) the artist's secretary and sister-in-law.  The colour scheme of the painting is black, mother of pearl and silver. The title refers to Ethel\u2019s grey silk evening dress, which is a Parisian dress in a belle \u00e9poque style, with the transparent layered sleeves of the black bolero jacket resembling a traditional Andalusian costume.  James McNeill Whistler was born in the United States in 1834, the son of George Washington Whistler, a railway engineer. In 1843, his father relocated the family to Saint Petersburg, Russia, where James received training in painting. After a stay in England, he returned to America to attend the US Military Academy at West Point in 1851. In 1855, he made his way back to Europe, determined to dedicate himself to painting. He settled in Paris at first, but in 1859 moved to London, where he would spend most of the remainder of his life. Although he returned to Paris from 1892 to 1901 and resided at 110 Rue du Bac, Paris, with his studio at the top of 86 Rue Notre Dame des Champs.  Ethel Birnie Philip was born at Chelsea, London, on 29 September 1861. She was the daughter of the sculptor John Birnie Philip and Frances Black. Her sister Beatrice (also called \"Beatrix\" or \"Trixie') married Whistler in 1888. Ethel worked for a time in 1893\u20131894 as secretary to Whistler. She married Charles Whibley in 1896 in the garden of the house occupied by Whistler at Rue du Bac. Her sister Rosalind Birnie Philip succeeded Ethel as Whistler's secretary, and was appointed the artist's executrix at his death.  Whistler painted a number of full-length portraits of Ethel, including Mother of Pearl and Silver: The Andalusian and the watercolour Rose and Silver: Portrait of Mrs Whibley; and other sketches and etchings of her titled as Miss Ethel Philip or Mrs Whibley.  Whistler commenced work on The Andalusian in London in 1888, the year Whistler married Beatrix, with the painting being completed in Paris in 1900.\n", "\nArtist: Andrew Wyeth\nArtwork Name: Christina's World\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrew-wyeth/christinas-world-1948\n\nWikipedia Article:\nChristina's World is a 1948 painting by American painter Andrew Wyeth and one of the best-known American paintings of the middle 20th century. It is a tempera work done in a realist style, depicting a woman semi-reclining on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house. It is owned by the Museum of Modern Art in New York as part of its permanent collection.  The woman in the painting is Anna Christina Olson (3 May 1893 \u2013 27 January 1968). She probably suffered from Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease, a genetic polyneuropathy. Wyeth was inspired to create the painting when he saw her crawling across a field while he was watching from a window in the house. He had a summer home in the area and was on friendly terms with Olson, using her and her younger brother as the subjects of paintings from 1940 to 1968. Olson was the inspiration and subject of the painting but she was not the primary model; Wyeth's wife Betsy posed as the torso of the painting. Olson was 55 at the time that Wyeth created the work.  The house depicted in the painting is known as the Olson House in Cushing, Maine and is open to the public, operated by the Farnsworth Art Museum. It is a National Historic Landmark and has been restored to match its appearance in the painting, although Wyeth separated the house from its barn and changed the lay of the land for the painting.  Christina's World was first exhibited at the Macbeth Gallery in Manhattan in 1948. It received little attention from critics at the time, but Alfred Barr, the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), bought the painting for $1,800. He promoted it at MoMA and it gradually grew in popularity over the years. Today, it is considered an icon of American art and is rarely loaned out by the museum.  It is often perceived as the embodiment of a strong sense of longing.  In Arthur C. Clarke's novel 2001: A Space Odyssey, Christina's World is one of the two paintings (the other one being Vincent van Gogh's Bridge at Arles) hanging on the living room wall of \"an elegant, anonymous hotel suite\" to which the astronaut David Bowman is transported after passing through the Star Gate. It does not appear in the film adaptation directed by Stanley Kubrick.  In issue #28 of Garth Ennis's comics series Preacher, Jesse Custer is sitting in front of the painting in the MoMA, examining it. In issue #43, the story of which is titled \"Christina's World\", Jesse relates his visit to the museum to his mother, Christina L'Angell, who explains to him that when she first discovered the painting in a book, she thought Wyeth had painted her own life. In addition, the cover to issue #43 by artist Glenn Fabry is a variation of Christina's World, with Christina in the role of Anna Christina Olson.\n", "\nArtist: Jan Cox\nArtwork Name: The Hiding\nArtwork Genre: still life\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-cox/the-hiding-1942\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJan Cox (27 August 1919 \u2013 7 October 1980) was a painter who spent the largest part of his creative life in the United States and Belgium.

The Cremaster Cycle was made over a period of eight years (1994\u20132002) and culminated in a major museum exhibition organized by Nancy Spector of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which traveled to the Museum Ludwig in Cologne and the Mus\u00e9e d'art Moderne in Paris from 2002-03. Barney's longtime collaborator Jonathan Bepler composed and arranged the soundtracks for the films. The series incorporates a multidisciplinary narrative that heavily references connections between real people, real places and real things personal to Barney himself, but are all fictionalized to some extent.  Guggenheim Museum curator Nancy Spector has described the Cremaster cycle (1994\u20132002) as \"a self-enclosed aesthetic system.\" The cycle includes the films as well as photographs, drawings, sculptures, and installations the artist produced in conjunction with each episode. Its conceptual departure point is the male cremaster muscle, the primary function of which is to raise and lower the testes in response to temperature. The project is filled with anatomical allusions to the position of the reproductive organs during the embryonic process of sexual differentiation: Cremaster 1 represents the most \"ascended\" or undifferentiated state, Cremaster 5 the most \"descended\" or differentiated. The cycle repeatedly returns to those moments during early sexual development in which the outcome of the process is still unknown \u2014 in Barney's metaphoric universe, these moments represent a condition of pure potentiality. As the cycle evolved over eight years, Barney looked beyond biology as a way to explore the creation of form, employing narrative models from other realms, such as biography, mythology, and geology. Barney portrays, at various points, a satyr and Gary Gilmore. Ursula Andress portrays the Queen of Chain in Cremaster 5. Norman Mailer, Patty Griffin, and Dave Lombardo portray Harry Houdini, Nicole Baker, and Johnny Cash respectively in Cremaster 2. Richard Serra and Aimee Mullins portray Hiram Abiff and Sadhbh respectively, in Cremaster 3.  While thematically the Cremaster films are chronological in the numbered order, they were not made or released in the same manner. The order in which they were made is as follows:  The numerical order is the thematic order, while in order of production the films increased in production quality, ambition and scope, and they can alternatively be viewed in any order, as different views of a set of themes and preoccupations.  The films are significantly different in length; the longest (and last-made) is Cremaster 3, at over three hours, while the remaining four are approximately an hour each, for a total of approximately seven hours \u2013 #3 alone makes up almost half the total length of the cycle. Like Barney's other works, most of the films lack any particular dialogue with the exceptions being Cremaster 2 and 5, the latter of which is an opera sung in Hungarian.  An important precursor of The Cremaster Cycle is Drawing Restraint, which is also a biologically inspired multi-episode work in multiple media, also featuring the field emblem.\n", "\nArtist: Joseph Anton Koch\nArtwork Name: Landschaft Mit Bileam\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: etching\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/joseph-anton-koch/landschaft-mit-bileam\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBalaam /\u02c8be\u026al\u00e6m/ (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05b4\u05bc\u05dc\u05b0\u05e2\u05b8\u05dd\u202c, Standard Bil\u02bbam Tiberian Bile\u02bb\u0101m) is a diviner in the Torah, his story occurring towards the end of the Book of Numbers (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u202c). Every ancient reference to Balaam considers him a non-Israelite, a prophet, and the son of Beor, though Beor is not clearly identified. Though some sources may only describe the positive blessings he delivers upon the Israelites, he is reviled as a \"wicked man\" in both Torah and its commentaries, as well as in the New Testament. Balaam refused to speak what God did not speak and would not curse the Israelites, even though King Balak of Moab offered him money to do so (Numbers 22\u201324). But Balaam's error and the source of his wickedness came from sabotaging the Israelites as they entered the Promised Land. According to Revelation 2:14, Balaam told King Balak how to get the Israelites to commit sin by enticing them with sexual immorality and food sacrificed to idols. The Israelites fell into transgression due to these traps and God sent a deadly plague to them as a result (Numbers 31:16).\r The main story of Balaam occurs during the sojourn of the Israelites in the plains of Moab, east of the Jordan River, at the close of forty years of wandering, shortly before the death of Moses and the crossing of the Jordan. The Israelites have already defeated two kings in Transjordan: Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan. Balak, king of Moab, consequently becomes alarmed, and sends elders of Midian and his Moabite messengers, to Balaam, son of Beor, to induce him to come and curse Israel. Balaam's location, Pethor, is simply given as \"which is by the river of the land of the children of his people\" in the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint, though the Samaritan Pentateuch, Vulgate, and Peshitta all identify his land as Ammon.\r Balaam sends back word that he can only do what YHWH commands, and God has, via a nocturnal dream, told him not to go. Balak consequently sends higher-ranking priests and offers Balaam honours; Balaam continues to press God, and God finally permits him to go but with instructions to say only what he commands. Balaam then sets out in the morning with the princes of Moab. God becomes angry that he went, and sends the Angel of the Lord (Numbers 22:22) to prevent him. At first the angel is seen only by the donkey Balaam is riding, which tries to avoid the angel. After Balaam starts punishing the donkey for refusing to move, it is miraculously given the power to speak to Balaam (Numbers 22:28), and it complains about Balaam's treatment. At this point, Balaam is allowed to see the angel, who informs him that the donkey is the only reason the angel did not kill Balaam. Balaam immediately repents, but is told to go on.\r Balak meets with Balaam at Kirjat Huzoth, and they go to the \"high places of Baal\", and offer sacrifices on seven altars, leading to Balaam being given a prophecy by Yahweh, which he speaks to Balak. However, the prophecy blesses Israel; Balak remonstrates, but Balaam reminds him that he can only speak the words put in his mouth, so Balak takes him to another \"high place\" at Pisgah, to try again. Building another seven altars here, and making sacrifices on each, Balaam provides another prophecy blessing Israel.\n", "\nArtist: Joseph Anton Koch\nArtwork Name: Antenora, Ugolino with his sons in the Tower of Hunger\nArtwork Genre: history painting,literary painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/joseph-anton-koch/antenora-ugolino-mit-seinen-sohnen-im-turm-des-hungers\n\nWikipedia Article:\nCount Ugolino della Gherardesca (c.\u20091220\u00a0\u2013 March 1289), count of Donoratico, was an Italian nobleman, politician and naval commander. He was frequently accused of treason and features prominently in Dante's Divine Comedy.\r In the 13th century, Italy was beset by the strife of two parties, the Ghibellines and the Guelphs. While the conflict was local and personal in origin, the parties had come to be associated with the two universal powers: the Ghibellines sided with the Holy Roman Emperor and his rule of Italy, while the Guelphs sided with the Pope, who supported self-governing city-states.\r Pisa was controlled by the Ghibellines, while most of the surrounding cities were controlled by the Guelphs, most notably Pisa's trading rivals Genoa and Florence. Under the circumstances, Pisa adopted the \"strong and vigilant government\" of a podest\u00e0 \"armed with almost despotic power\"\r Ugolino was born in Pisa into the della Gherardesca family, a noble family of Germanic origins whose alliance with the Hohenstaufen Emperors had brought to prominence in Tuscany and made them the leaders of the Ghibellines in Pisa.\r Between 1256 and 1258 he participated in the war against the filo-genoese giudicato of Cagliari, in Sardinia. Ugolino then obtained the south-western portion of the former giudical territory, with its rich silver mines, where he founded the important city of Villa di Chiesa, today Iglesias.\r As head of his family, the Ghibelline party and podest\u00e0 of Pisa, Ugolino took action to preserve his power in the face of the political hostility of Pisa's neighbours. In 1271, through a marriage of his sister with Giovanni Visconti, judge of Gallura, he allied himself with the Visconti, the leaders of the Guelphs in Pisa. In doing so, he aroused the suspicions of his fellow Ghibellines.\r The subsequent disorders in the city in 1274 led to the arrest of both Ugolino and Giovanni, who were accused of plotting to undermine Pisa's government and, with the support from Tuscany's Guelphs, share power among themselves. Ugolino was imprisoned and Giovanni banished from Pisa. Giovanni Visconti died soon afterwards, and Ugolino, no longer regarded as a threat, was set free and banished. In exile, Ugolino immediately began to intrigue with the Guelph cities of Florence and Lucca. With the help of Charles I of Anjou, he attacked his native city and forced it to make peace on humiliating terms, pardoning him and all the other Guelph exiles. After his return, Ugolino at first remained aloof from politics but quietly worked to reassert his influence.\r In 1284, war broke out between Pisa and Genoa and both Ugolino and Andreotto Saracini were appointed as captains of two divisions of fleets by Alberto Morosini, the Podest\u00e0 of Pisa. The two fleets met in August in the Battle of Meloria. The Genoese fought valiantly and destroyed seven Pisan galleys and captured twenty-eight. Among the eleven thousand captives was the Podest\u00e0. Ugolino and his division set the sign of surrender and withdrew, deciding the battle in favour of Genoa. This flight was later interpreted as treachery but not by any writer earlier than the 16th century.\n", "\nArtist: Eugene de Blaas\nArtwork Name: In the water\nArtwork Genre: nude painting (nu)\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-de-blaas/in-the-water\n\nWikipedia Article:\nIn the Water (French: Dans l'Eau) is an oil on cradled panel painting of a skinny dipping young woman by Eugene de Blaas.

The line, which is still made and sold by Vitra, consists of modern chairs and tables. Made with hidden screws and fiberboard edging, the tables are said to hold thousands of pounds. The \"Wiggle Chair,\" which has won many design awards and has been included in museum shows at London's Design Museum and elsewhere, contains 60 layers of corrugated cardboard held together by hidden screws and fibreboard edging.\r In the Beginning of the 1980s cardboard furniture becomes very popular in France by the technique of Eric Guiomar. It is totally different to the technique of Frank Gehry. The furniture in the technique of Guiomar is made with corrugated cardboard, simple, double and triple groove. First, a frame is created with intertwined cardboard plates which are cut out according to the original design. This is the support frame of the piece, just like it would be the case for a ship. Then, the frame is covered with cardboard that will be \"rolled\" on its forms to a perfect fit. This technique allows a great freedom in the choice of shapes and materials.\r Aside from gallery exhibits, the idea of using cardboard as a material for constructing furniture is becoming increasingly popular, especially given its sustainable credentials. Cardboard is fully recyclable and is predominantly made from recycled paper. It usually can also be printed on in any color and pattern. New areas of marketing have started to go deeper in sustainable products. Green marketing is one of them, it defines segments inclined to consume a product like cardboard furniture (e.g. LOHAS).\n", "\nArtist: Manfred Kielnhofer\nArtwork Name: Modern and Contemporary Photography Circle of Life Water Reflection mirror Manfred Kielnhofer\nArtwork Genre: figurative,performance\nArtwork Media: photography\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/manfred-kielnhofer/modern-and-contemporary-photography-circle-of-life-water-reflection-mirror-manfred-kielnhofer\n\nWikipedia Article:\nManfred \"KILI\" Kielnhofer (born January 28, 1967 in Haslach an der M\u00fchl) is an Austrian painter, sculptor, designer and photographer.\r Manfred \"KILI\" Kielnhofer visited the technical College Linz where he took his final exam in 1995. he was engaged with technique and design and art on building lead him to his special way of art.

His father distinguished himself in the civil war in the royalist cause and died in 1644. Savile was also the nephew of Sir William Coventry, who is said to have influenced his political opinions, and of Lord Shaftesbury, afterwards his most bitter opponent, and great-nephew of the Earl of Strafford. He was the great-grandson of Sir George Savile of Lupset and Thornhill (created baronet in 1611). He was educated at Shrewsbury School in 1643 while his mother was staying with a sister in Shropshire. He later travelled in France, where he attended a Huguenot academy in Paris, stayed in Angers and Orleans, in Italy and in the Netherlands, and was also believed to have been educated in Geneva. He returned to England by 1652.\r In 1660, Savile was elected Member of Parliament for Pontefract in the Convention Parliament, and this was his only appearance in the Lower House. In the same year he was made Deputy Lieutenant for the county of Yorkshire and Colonel of a foot regiment in the Yorkshire Militia.\r The Duke of York sought a peerage for him in 1665, but was successfully opposed by Clarendon, on the ground of his \"ill-reputation amongst men of piety and religion.\" The chancellor\u2019s real motives may have been Savile\u2019s connection with Buckingham and Coventry. The honors were, however, only deferred for a short time and were obtained after the fall of Clarendon on 31 December 1667, when Savile was created Baron Savile of Eland and Viscount Halifax.\r In 1667 he was commissioned Captain to raise a troop in Yorkshire for Prince Rupert's Regiment of Horse.\r Halifax supported zealously the anti-French policy formulated in the Triple Alliance of January 1668. He was created a privy councillor in 1672, and, while it is believed that he was ignorant of the secret clauses in the Treaty of Dover, was chosen envoy to negotiate terms of peace with Louis XIV and the Dutch at Utrecht. His mission was still further deprived of importance by Arlington and Buckingham (who were in the king's counsels), who anticipated his arrival and took the negotiations out of his hands. Though he signed the compact, Halifax claimed no share in the harsh terms imposed upon the Dutch, and henceforth became a bitter opponent of the policy of subservience to French interests and of the Roman Catholic claims.\r Halifax took an active part in Parliament's passage of the Test Act of 1673, and thereby forfeited his friendship with James. In 1674 he brought forward a motion for disarming \"popish recusants,\" and supported one by Lord Carlisle for restricting the marriages in the royal family to Protestants; but he opposed the bill introduced by Lord Danby in 1675, that imposed a test oath on officials and members of parliament, speaking \"with that quickness, learning and elegance that are inseparable from all his discourses,\" and ridiculing the multiplication of oaths, since \"no man would ever sleep with open doors. . . should all the town be sworn not to rob.\" He was now on bad terms with Danby, and a witty sally at that minister\u2019s expense caused his dismissal from the council in January 1676.\n", "\nArtist: Mary Beale\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Sir Edmund Andros (1637-1714)\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/mary-beale/portrait-of-sir-edmund-andros-1637-1714\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSir Edmund Andros (6 December 1637\u00a0\u2013 24 February 1714) was an English colonial administrator in North America. He was the governor of the Dominion of New England during most of its three-year existence. At other times, Andros served as governor of the provinces of New York, East and West Jersey, Virginia, and Maryland.\r Before his service in North America, he served as Bailiff of Guernsey. His tenure in New England was authoritarian and turbulent, as his views were decidedly pro-Anglican, a negative quality in a region home to many Puritans. His actions in New England resulted in his overthrow during the 1689 Boston revolt.\r Andros was considered to have been a more effective governor in New York and Virginia, although he became the enemy of prominent figures in both colonies, many of whom worked to remove him from office. Despite these enmities, he managed to negotiate several treaties of the Covenant Chain with the Iroquois, establishing a long-lived peace involving the colonies and other tribes that interacted with that confederacy. His actions and governance generally followed the instructions he was given upon appointment to office, and he received approbation from the monarchs and governments that appointed him.\r Andros was recalled to England from Virginia in 1698, and resumed the title of Bailiff of Guernsey. Although he no longer resided entirely on Guernsey, he was appointed lieutenant governor of the island, and served in this position for four years. Andros died in 1714.\r Andros was born in London on 6 December 1637. Amice Andros, his father, was Bailiff of Guernsey and a staunch supporter of Charles I. His mother was Elizabeth Stone, whose sister was a courtier to the king's sister, Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia. Although it has been claimed that Andros was present at the surrender in 1651 of Guernsey's Castle Cornet, the last royalist stronghold to surrender in the English Civil War, there is no firm evidence to support this. It is possible that he fled Guernsey with his mother in 1645. In 1656, he was apprenticed to his uncle, Sir Robert Stone, captain of a cavalry company. Andros then served in two winter campaigns in Denmark, including the relief of Copenhagen in 1659. As a result of these experiences he gained fluency in French, Swedish, and Dutch.\r He remained a firm supporter of the Stuarts while they were in exile. Charles II, after his restoration to the throne, specifically commended the Andros family for its support.\r Andros served as a courtier to Elizabeth of Bohemia from 1660 until her death in 1662. In 1671, he married Mary Craven, the daughter of Thomas Craven of Burnsall in the West Riding of Yorkshire (now North Yorkshire), the son of a cousin to the Earl of Craven, one of the queen's closest advisors, and a friend who served as his patron for many years. During the 1660s he served in the English army against the Dutch. He was next commissioned a major in the regiment of Sir Tobias Bridge, which was sent to Barbados in 1666. He returned to England two years later, carrying despatches and letters.\n", "\nArtist: William Hogarth\nArtwork Name: Scene in a Tavern (The Orgy)\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-hogarth/scene-in-a-tavern-1735\n\nWikipedia Article:\nTavern Scene or The Orgy is a work by William Hogarth from 1735, the third picture from the series A Rake's Progress.\r A Rake's Progress totals eight oil paintings from 1732-33. They were published as engravings from 1734. The series depicts the fictional Tom Rakewell's decline and fall. He was the free spending son and heir of a rich merchant. In the story, he comes to London, wasting his money on luxurious life, buying the services of prostitutes and gambling. He ends up in Fleet Prison, and finally at the Bethlem Hospital, or Bedlam.\r The picture, which draws from the merry company tradition of painting, shows the beginning of Tom Rakewell's way down. It depicts a riotous scene on the combined brothel and the restaurant Rose Tavern at Drury Lane in Covent Garden at three o'clock in the morning.\r The protagonist Tom, drunk with his sword at his side and surrounded by prostitutes, is sprawling in a chair, with one foot on a table. Beside him is a rod and lantern, which he stole during his nocturnal wanderings in the streets. Two of the women are stealing Tom's watch. In the doorway a female street singer makes an appearance.\r In the engraved variant to the right of the picture is a stripper and naked to show off naked poses, for drawings on the table on a tin tray, which a servant is bearing into the room.\r On one of the walls, hangs a world map and framed prints of among others the Roman emperors Augustus, Titus, Otho, Vitellius and Vespasian.\r The eight paintings in the series were sold by William Beckford at an auction at Christie's in 1802 for 570 guineas by John Soane. They then hung at Soane's country house Pitzhanger Manor, and from 1810 in Soane's town house in Lincoln's Inn Fields. The Brothel painting scene and the other seven paintings in the series are available in the picture gallery in the city residence, now converted to Sir John Soane's Museum.\r Hogarth's picture suite has been used as the basis for the English opera The Rake's Progress, with libretto by W.H. Auden and Chester Kallman and with music by Igor Stravinsky. Stravinsky had noted William Hogarth's pictures at an exhibition in Chicago in 1947, and got the idea to write an opera on the theme.\n", "\nArtist: William Hogarth\nArtwork Name: The Distrest Poet\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-hogarth/the-distrest-poet-1736\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Distrest Poet is an oil painting produced sometime around 1736 by the British artist William Hogarth. Reproduced as an etching and engraving, it was published in 1741 from a third state plate produced in 1740. The scene was probably inspired by Alexander Pope's satirical poem The Dunciad. It depicts a scene in a small, dingy attic room where a poet sits at his desk in the dormer and, scratching his head, stares at the papers on the desk before him, evidently looking for inspiration to complete the poem he is writing. Near him sits his wife darning clothes, surprised by the entrance of a milkmaid, who impatiently demands payment of debts.\r The engraving of The Distrest Poet in its third state was issued on 15 December 1741 as a companion piece to The Enraged Musician, a comic scene of a violinist driven to distraction by the noise from the street outside his practice room. The initial plate for The Distrest Poet was produced soon after Hogarth had completed the oil painting, but the third state plate was not completed until late in 1740 at which time Hogarth advertised his intention to issue a three-image set: The Provok'd Musician, The Distrest Poet, and a third image on the subject of \"Painting\". The Provok'd Musician (renamed The Enraged Musician) was produced in 1741 but the third image was never completed.\r The scene is set in a small and messy garret, sparsely furnished by a few pieces of crude furniture. The room is poorly kept, with cracking plaster, a broken window and uneven floor, and a bare cupboard. In this way, Hogarth underlines the desperate circumstances of the occupants and the poverty of the family.\r Starved of inspiration and suffering writer's block, the poet sits on the end of his bed in his night gown, quill in hand, scratching his head. A copy of Edward Bysshe's The Art of English Poetry, a guide to composition published in 1702, lies open on the table. A copy of Popes's satirical Grub Street Journal lies on the floor near his feet.\r A few feet to his right sits his wife, darning the clothes on her lap and those sprawled on the floor, where a cat sits, while a crying infant, who is upset and hungry, goes unattended in the only bed. Next to the poet's wife, by the open door, an angry milkmaid presents her substantial bill, demanding payment for milk, underlining the poet's refusal to provide for his family by getting himself a proper job. The cupboard stands open and empty, save for a mouse; near the door, a dog steals the last of the family's food from a plate.\r Other, less obvious, elements of the painting reveal more about the poet's personality and ideas. The poem he is attempting to write is entitled \"Upon Riches\", which suggests that the poet lives in a fantasy world, while his wife and child go hungry. Ned Ward's first published poem in 1691 was The Poet's Ramble After Riches, which satirised his own struggles as an impoverished aspiring poet, and Hogarth may have had this in mind when he produced the picture. Earlier impressions showed the poem as \"Poverty, A Poem\", which hinted at a connection to Theobald who had written \"The Cave of Poverty, A Poem, Written in Imitation of Shakespeare\" in 1714. The poet's dreams of riches are further suggested by the map that hangs over his head, entitled \"A View of the Gold Mines of Peru\", replacing the image of Pope that appears in the earlier states of the print. The poet's self-interest is hinted by the presence of his pipe and tobacco on the window sill, the mug of beer sitting on the chair in the back of the room, the lace cuffs drying by the fire, his ill-fitting wig, and gentleman's sword lying at his feet; it may be that despite his family's circumstances, he refuses to forgo his own personal pleasures and effects. Alternatively, his fantasy of earning a fortune from his art may require that he keeps his gentlemanly accoutrements around him, as they will be required when his fantasies are realized.\n", "\nArtist: William Hogarth\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Captain Coram\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-hogarth/portrait-of-captain-coram-1740\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Captain Thomas Coram is a 1740 portrait of philanthropist Thomas Coram painted by William Hogarth.

It is a group portrait depicting the four children of Daniel Graham, apothecary to King George II. The youngest child had died by the time the painting was completed.\r The painting was in the ownership of Richard Robert Graham, depicted on the far right of the painting, at least until his death in 1816. It then had several owners before it was acquired by Lord Duveen who presented it to the British National Gallery in 1934.\r The Graham Children is a conversation piece, an informal group portrait of family or friends, often engaged in conversation or some other kind of activity, though the painting is larger than a typical work of that type. From left to right in the picture are Thomas, born 1740 and dressed in skirts as was typical for small boys until they were breeched, Henrietta, Anna Maria and Richard.\r Infant mortality in Britain was high in the eighteenth century, even for the children of the wealthy, and Thomas had died before the painting was completed. Hogarth used a study, probably completed after Thomas's death, as the basis for his image. With its numerous references to death and the passage of time, it may be that the painting is a form of memorial for Thomas.\r The children are painted life size, surrounded by plush furnishings and fabrics that reflect the family's wealth. A gilded bird cage is suspended from a cord and Thomas sits in an ornate baby cart with a fine silver fruit bowl at his feet. Richard plays a tune on a bird-organ, apparently making the bird sing.\r The French Rococo was at its height in the 1730s and its influence can be seen in the painting despite Hogarth not visiting France until 1743. William Gaunt thought that Hogarth was more familiar with current French painting than he liked to admit. The girl's aprons form serpentine S's, vertically in the oldest child, ending as it falls over her arm, and horizontally in the younger girl. A similar shape can be seen in the falling curtain on the right. The heads of the children and the cat create another noticeable S shape. The fruit bowl, a common subject in Rococo art, has been described as a \"bravura piece of still-life painting\" untypical of Hogarth's work.\r David Bindman described The Graham Children as having a theme worthy of a history painting. Hogarth turned what could have been a simple family scene, even one with a tragic edge, into a parable about the \u201cpassing of time and the vulnerability of innocence\u201d. The picture plays with time with different parts moving at different speeds. The boys are captured in mid movement, like the cat and bird, while the girls seem to be completely still, so that the picture is both a snap shot of a fleeting moment and a static portrait simultaneously. The oldest, Henrietta, holds the wrist of the youngest, perhaps indicating her future role as a mother, but not tightly and neither exchange looks, but neither do any of the children. Henrietta, instead, looks at the spectator, indicating her awareness of the adult world that she will soon join. The other children, however, remain in the innocent bubble of childhood.\n", "\nArtist: William Hogarth\nArtwork Name: The servants of the painter\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-hogarth/the-servants-of-the-painter\n\nWikipedia Article:\nHeads of Six of Hogarth's Servants is an oil-on-canvas painting by William Hogarth from c. 1750-5. Measuring 63 centimetres (25\u00a0in) high and 75.5 centimetres (29.7\u00a0in) wide, it depicts the heads of six of his domestic servants. It is held by in the Tate Gallery in London.\r This is evidently a late work by Hogarth, demonstrating his mastery of portraiture. The subject matter and composition are unusual, with six studies of heads crammed in a small space, distributed in three groups of two, all lit by a light source at the upper left. Space for a seventh head has been marked out roughly in the lower left corner but it was not completed like the other six. The left edge of the canvas was later cut to frame the six completed heads better, cutting off part of the absent seventh head.\r The painting shows three men and three women, of varying ages from youth to maturity, reminiscent of the seven ages of man, and with varying skin tones. Hogarth is exploring the differences of human physiognomy as he had in his print Characters and Caricaturas of 1743. Each subject looks in a different direction, with no lines of vision intersecting, reflecting the sketch-like nature of the work. The three female figures have similarly youthful appearances, not children but also not old. The male figures progress in age from a boy at the top centre, through a mature man at the bottom centre, to a more elderly man at the top right. The older man is possibly Ben Ives; the other servants may be \"Samuel\"; Mary Lewis, Hogarth's wife's cousin, who later inherited the painting; and Mrs Chappel, who was known to have worked for the Hogarths in Chiswick. Ronald Paulson believes the servants featured could be a coachman, valet, page, housekeeper and two housemaids. The servants are shown in their natural appearance, in their usual work clothes, capturing their individual characters. It was painted with warmth and sensitivity, demonstrating Hogarth's affection for his servants, and a lightness of touch reminiscent of his uncompleted portrait of The Shrimp Girl.\r The work was not commissioned, but rather painted for Hogarth's own amusement. It may have been hung in Hogarth's studio to demonstrate his ability as a portraitist to his patrons. It was inherited by Hogarth's wife after his death, and left to Mary Lewis in 1789. It was sold at Greenwood's in April 1790; displayed at the British Institution in 1817 and Suffolk Street Gallery in 1833. It was sold at Christie's in 1879 and again in 1892, when it was bought by the National Gallery with money from the Lewis Fund. It was transferred to the Tate Gallery in 1960.\n", "\nArtist: George Stubbs\nArtwork Name: Whistlejacket\nArtwork Genre: animal painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/george-stubbs/whistlejacket\n\nWikipedia Article:\nWhistlejacket is an oil-on-canvas painting from about 1762 by the British artist George Stubbs showing the Marquess of Rockingham's racehorse approximately at lifesize, rearing up against a plain background. The canvas is large, lacks any other content except some discreet shadows, and Stubbs has paid precise attention to the details of the horse's appearance. It has been described in The Independent as \"a paradigm of the flawless beauty of an Arabian thoroughbred\". The Fitzwilliam family, heirs of the childless Rockingham, retained the painting until 1997 when funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund allowed the National Gallery, London to acquire it for \u00a311 million.\r Stubbs was a specialist equine artist who in 1762 was invited by Rockingham to spend \"some months\" at Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire, his main country house. Stubbs had painted many horse portraits, with and without human figures, but the heroic scale and lack of background of Whistlejacket are \"unprecedented\" in his work and equine portraits in general and \"contemporaries were so astonished that a single horse should command a huge canvas that legends quickly developed\" explaining why the painting was unfinished, none of which seem plausible or supported by the evidence to modern art historians. In fact Stubbs' earliest canvases on his visit in 1762 included a pair of much smaller paintings of groups of standing horses, one including Whistlejacket, in a horizontal format \"like a classical frieze\" with a similar honey beige background broken only by small shadows at the feet. It would seem likely that leaving the portraits without the usual landscape background was Rockingham's idea.\r Stubbs depicts Whistlejacket rising to a levade, but with his head turned towards the viewer, in a pose comparable to a number of earlier monumental equestrian portraits, including examples by Rubens and Vel\u00e1zquez, but in these the emphasis is on the rider. Here the horse is alone and in a natural state, producing a \"romantic study in solitude and liberty\". Like many of Stubbs's other paintings of horses and other animals in the wild, including several versions of a horse attacked by a lion perched on its back, the painting is an early intimation of Romanticism, as well as a challenge to the lowly place animal painting occupied in the hierarchy of genres.\r To a greater degree than any earlier painter, Stubbs produced genuinely individual portraits of specific horses, paying intimate attention to details of their form. Minute blemishes, veins, and the muscles flexing just below the surface of the skin are all visible and reproduced with great care and realism. Whistlejacket had already retired after a fairly successful racing career, but was painted in this unusual form to show \"a supremely beautiful specimen of the pure-bred Arabian horse at its finest\".\r Stubbs' knowledge of equine physiology was unsurpassed by any painter; he had studied anatomy at York and, from 1756, he spent 18 months in Lincolnshire where he carried out dissections and experiments on dead horses to better understand the animal's physiology. He suspended the cadavers with block and tackle to better able sketch them in different positions. The careful notes and drawings he made during his studies were published in 1766 in The Anatomy of the Horse. Even before the publication of his book, Stubbs' dedication to his subject reaped him rewards: his drawings were recognized as more accurate than the work of other equine artists and commissions from aristocratic patrons quickly followed.\n", "\nArtist: Joseph Wright\nArtwork Name: Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/joseph-wright/the-orrery\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery, or the full title, A Philosopher giving that Lecture on the Orrery in which a lamp is put in place of the Sun, is a 1766 painting by Joseph Wright of Derby depicting a lecturer giving a demonstration of an orrery to a small audience.  It is now in the Derby Museum and Art Gallery  The painting preceded his similar An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump (National Gallery, London).  The first of Wright's candlelit masterpieces, Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight, was painted in 1765, and showed three men studying a small copy of the \"Borghese Gladiator\". The Gladiator was greatly admired; but his next painting, The Orrery, caused a greater stir, as it replaced the Classical subject at the centre of the scene with one of a scientific nature. Wright's depiction of the awe produced by scientific \"miracles\" marked a break with previous traditions in which the artistic depiction of such wonder was reserved for religious events, since to Wright the marvels of the technological age were as awe-inspiring as the subjects of the great religious paintings.   In both of these works, the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing sculpture by candlelight, when the contours showed well, and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the Sun were an essential part of the display. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.  The painting was one of a number of British works challenging the set categories of the rigid, French-dictated, hierarchy of genres in the late 18th century, as other types of painting aspired to be treated as seriously as the costumed history painting of a Classical or mythological subject. In some respects the Orrery and Air Pump subjects resembled conversation pieces, then largely a form of middle-class portraiture, though soon to be given new status when Johann Zoffany began to paint the royal family in about 1766. Given their solemn atmosphere however, and as it seems none of the figures are intended to be understood as portraits (even if models may be identified), the paintings can not be regarded as conversation pieces. The 20th-century art historian Ellis Waterhouse compares these two works to the \"genre serieux\" of contemporary French drama, as defined by Denis Diderot and Pierre Beaumarchais, a view endorsed by Egerton.  An anonymous review from the time called Wright \"a very great and uncommon genius in a peculiar way\".   The Orrery was painted without a commission, probably in the expectation that it would be bought by Washington Shirley, 5th Earl Ferrers, an amateur astronomer who had an orrery of his own, and with whom Wright's friend Peter Perez Burdett was staying while in Derbyshire. Figures thought to be portraits of Burdett and Ferrers feature in the painting, Burdett taking notes and Ferrers seated with a youth next to the orrery.Ferrers purchased the painting, which was exhibited in 1766, for \u00a3210, but the 6th Earl auctioned it off, and it is now in the Derby Museum and Art Gallery, where it is on permanent display, close to a working replica of a full-sized mechanical Grand Orrery.\n", "\nArtist: William Blake\nArtwork Name: The Ancient of Days\nArtwork Genre: illustration\nArtwork Media: etching,ink,paper,pen,watercolor\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-blake/the-ancient-of-days-1794\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Ancient of Days is a design by William Blake, originally published as the frontispiece to the 1794 work Europe a Prophecy.

The deistic view of God as a distant creator who played no role in daily affairs was anathema to Blake, who claimed to regularly experience visions of a spiritual nature. He contrasts his \"four-fold vision\" to the \"single vision\" of Newton, whose \"natural religion\" of scientific materialism he characterized as sterile.

Fantastic, spiritual art was popular in Britain from around 1770 to 1830, and during this time Blake often worked on unearthly, supernatural panels to amuse and amaze his friends.\r At 21.4\u00a0cm \u00d7 16.2\u00a0cm the work is a greatly reduced miniature portrait. Blake generally worked on a small scale; most of his illuminated pages, engravings and many of his paintings are only inches high. Although Ghost of a Flea is one of Blake's smallest works, it is monumental in its imagination. Its tiny scale achieves drama in contrasting the muscular bulk and apparent power of the creature against its incarnation in the panel as an insect.\r Blake first met John Varley in the autumn of 1818. Varley was 30 years younger than the artist, and has been described as a \"genial 17-stone bear of a man.\" A student of astrology and zodiacal physiognomy, Varley held a strong belief in the existence of spirits, but was frustrated by his inability to see them. Thus he was drawn to Blake, who claimed to have seen visions daily since when as a small child he had seen a tree \"filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars.\" The two would often gather late at night in Varley's house, and played a game in which Varley would attempt to summon the spirit of a historical or mythological person. On the appearance of the spirit, Blake would then attempt to sketch their likeness.\r According to Varley, the imagery of a Flea came to Blake during an 1819 s\u00e9ance. Varley described the scene:\r Blake's Victorian biographer Alexander Gilchrist (1828\u20131861) wrote that, three decades earlier in 1790, \"Blake, for the only time in his life, saw a ghost... Standing one evening at his garden-door in Lambeth, and chancing to look up, he saw a horrible grim figure, 'scaly, speckled, very awful,' stalking downstairs towards him. More frightened than ever before or after, he took to his heels, and ran out of the house.\"\r Although not directly stated by Gilchrist, there is a close connection between the ghost and the later The Head of the Ghost of a Flea.\r Blake often said that he was joined by invisible sitters as he drew them, including, he claimed, a number of angels, Voltaire, Moses and the Flea, who told him that \"fleas were inhabited by the souls of such men as were by nature blood thirsty to excess.\" In his obituary, it was stated that, \"The flea communicated to Mr. Blake what passed, as related to himself, at the Creation. 'It was first intended,' said he (the flea) 'to make me as big as a bullock; but then when it was considered from my construction, so armed\u2014and so powerful withal, that in proportion to my bulk, (mischievous as I now am) that I should have been a too mighty destroyer; it was determined to make me\u2014no bigger than I am.\"\n", "\nArtist: James Ward\nArtwork Name: An Overshot Mill in Wales (Aberdulais)\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/james-ward/an-overshot-mill-in-wales-aberdulais-1847\n\nWikipedia Article:\nAn Overshot Mill in Aberdulais, Wales is an 1847 oil on canvas painting by the British artist James Ward in the National Library of Wales.\r This painting shows the water mill located at the junction of the Dulais river and the Neath, near Aberdulais Falls.

His paintings are now considered among the most popular and valuable in British art.\r The National Gallery of Art holds this painting as one of its highlights:\r The painting was commissioned by the owner of Wivenhoe Park, Major General Francis Slater-Rebow, who was among the artist's first patrons, being a close friend of the artist's father, Golding Constable. Wivenhoe Park is 200 acres (81\u00a0ha) of parkland, purchased by the Rebow family before 1734. Slater-Rebow commissioned several paintings from Constable, including a portrait of the general's seven-year-old daughter in 1812. She also figures in this painting, in a donkey cart to the left. This painting, finished in September 1816, earned the artist enough money to allow him to marry his long-time love, Mary Bicknell. They married in October 1816.\r Constable's art is always penetrated by longing, melancholy and a yearning for the simple, natural life, for a bucolic, pastoral idyll, to rural subjects and aspects of life in the countryside, a \"golden age\" when people lived together in harmony with nature, a world on its way of disappearing when he painted his landscapes thanks to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. He was aware of the issue of urban growth, of urban life's unpleasantness- which he contrasted to life in the countryside. Constable's art was rather unconventional for his time, and he loved simple things, a natural landscape without the ruins, dramatic effects or exalted, often excessive feelings, like the ones displayed in the paintings of his contemporary, J. M. W. Turner. His landscapes are flooded by a silvery brilliant light in the water and air and in the sky - and are characterised by a special intensity that is such an important feature of this artist's works.\r Citations\r Bibliography\n", "\nArtist: John Constable\nArtwork Name: Flatford Mill\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-constable/flatford-mill-1817\n\nWikipedia Article:\nFlatford Mill (Scene on a Navigable River) is an oil painting by English artist John Constable, painted in 1816. It is Constable's largest exhibition canvas to be painted mainly outdoors, the first of his large \"six-foot\" paintings, and the first in the Stour series which later included The Hay Wain. It is owned and exhibited at the Tate Britain gallery in London.\r Flatford Mill (Scene on a Navigable River) is painted in oil on canvas. It depicts a working rural scene from Suffolk, as two lighter barges and their crew progress up the River Stour in Suffolk from Dedham Lock. Lighter barges were towed along the river by ropes attached to a horse, which had to be disconnected to allow the barges to be poled under Flatford bridge, which the barges are approaching. In the picture, a boy is disconnecting a rope and another sits astride a tow-horse. The rear scenery depicts the wider view of East Bergholt village, set under a towering trees and a dramatic, cloud-filled sky.\r Constable had adopted a routine of spending the winter in London and painting at East Bergholt in the summer. In 1811 he first visited Anglican bishop John Fisher and his family in Salisbury, but from 1809 onwards his childhood friendship with Maria Bicknell developed into a deep, mutual love. Their engagement in 1816 was opposed by Maria's grandfather, Dr. Rhudde, rector of East Bergholt, who considered the Constables his social inferiors and threatened Maria with disinheritance.\r Maria's father, Charles Bicknell, a solicitor, was reluctant to see Maria throw away this inheritance, and Maria herself pointed out that a penniless marriage would detract from any chances John had of making a career in painting. After the death of his parents in the same year, Constable inherited a fifth share in the family business. The couple's marriage in October 1816 at St Martin-in-the-Fields (with Fisher officiating), was followed by time at Fisher's vicarage and a honeymoon tour of the south coast, where the sea at Weymouth and Brighton stimulated Constable to develop new techniques of brilliant colour and vivacious brushwork.\r Before 1814, Constable produced his exhibition pictures in the studio, working from oil sketches and drawings. But that year he publicly declared his intention to make finished paintings from nature. The summers of 1816 and 1817 were the last which Constable spent any length of time at East Bergholt, and the last in which the artist painted directly from the scenery of his Suffolk childhood.\r Constable began the picture a few months before his marriage to Maria Bicknell, writing to her on 12 September 1816:\r Constable made several drawings and oil sketches of the subject from various angles. Although the final painting was executed largely on the spot, various details were added in the studio later: the boy and the horse; the timberwork in the foreground; the mooring-post on the left. It is known from later x-rays that Constable painted out a horse on the tow-path, and substituted the figures of the two boys.\r Exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1817 under the title Scene on a Navigable River, Constable repainted the tops of the trees and the entire sky afterwards. This was in time for the picture's second showing at the British Institution in January 1818, where it was given the title Flatford Mill.\n", "\nArtist: John Constable\nArtwork Name: The Hay Wain\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-constable/the-hay-wain-1821\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Hay Wain is a painting by John Constable, finished in 1821, which depicts a rural scene on the River Stour between the English counties of Suffolk and Essex. It hangs in the National Gallery in London and is regarded as \"Constable's most famous image\" and one of the greatest and most popular English paintings.\r Painted in oils on canvas, the work depicts as its central feature three horses pulling what in fact appears to be a wood wain or large farm cart across the river. Willy Lott's Cottage, also the subject of an eponymous painting by Constable, is visible on the far left. The scene takes place near Flatford Mill in Suffolk, though since the Stour forms the border of two counties, the left bank is in Suffolk and the landscape on the right bank is in Essex.\r The Hay Wain is one of a series of paintings by Constable called the \"six-footers\", large-scale canvasses which he painted for the annual summer exhibitions at the Royal Academy. As with all of the paintings in this series Constable produced a full-scale oil sketch for the work; this is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Constable originally exhibited the finished work with the title Landscape: Noon, suggesting that he envisaged it as belonging to the classical landscape tradition of representing the cycles of nature.\r Flatford Mill was owned by Constable's father. The house on the left side of the painting belonged to a neighbor, Willy Lott, a tenant farmer, who was said to have been born in the house and never to have left it for more than four days in his lifetime. Willy Lott's Cottage has survived to this day practically unaltered, but none of the trees in the painting exist today.\r Although The Hay Wain is revered today as one of the greatest British paintings, when it was originally exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821 (under the title Landscape: Noon), it failed to find a buyer.\r It was considerably better received in France where it was praised by Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault. The painting caused a sensation when it was exhibited with other works by Constable at the 1824 Paris Salon (it has been suggested that the inclusion of Constable's paintings in the exhibition was a tribute to G\u00e9ricault, who died early that year). In that exhibition, The Hay Wain was singled out for a gold medal awarded by Charles X of France, a cast of which is incorporated into the picture's frame. The works by Constable in the exhibition inspired a new generation of French painters, including Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix.\r Sold at the exhibition with three other Constables to the dealer John Arrowsmith, The Hay Wain was brought back to England by another dealer, D. T. White; he sold it to a Mr. Young who resided in Ryde on the Isle of Wight. It was there that the painting came to the attention of the collector Henry Vaughan and the painter Charles Robert Leslie. On the death of his friend Mr. Young, Vaughan bought the painting from the former's estate; in 1886 he presented it to the National Gallery in London, where it still hangs today. In his will Vaughan bequeathed the full-scale oil sketch for The Hay Wain, made with a palette knife, to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum).\n", "\nArtist: John Constable\nArtwork Name: The Lock\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-constable/the-lock-1824\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Lock is an oil painting by English artist John Constable, finished in 1824.

It was auctioned for \u00a322,441,250 at Christie's in London on 3 July 2012.\r The Lock is painted in oil on canvas. It depicts a working rural scene from Suffolk, as a figure struggles to open a canal gate at Dedham Lock near Flatford Mill in Suffolk to allow a lighter barge to progress on the River Stour. There is a distant view of Dedham church across the quintessentially English water meadows The scene is set under a towering tree and a dramatic, cloud-filled sky.\r The Lock is the fifth of six paintings that make up the Stour series of large-scale rural works, that Constable exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1819 and 1825. The painting is the only one of the series which remains in private hands, with the more famous The Hay Wain in the National Gallery, London.\r After its exhibition in 1824, The Morning Post commented: \"Mr Constable contributes a landscape composition which for depth, sparkling light, freshness and vigorous effect exceeds any of his works.\" Samuel William Reynolds offered to make a mezzotint print, but never completed it. His pupil David Lucas eventually prepared one from Constable's private copy of the painting (Foster version).\r On the opening day of the exhibition, James Morrison (1789\u20131857) an inn-keeper's son from Balham Hill, London, and Basildon Park, Berkshire, acquired the painting for 150 guineas, the only occasion in Constable's career when a painting sold on its first day of exhibition. Its ownership then progressed down through his family:\r On 14 November 1990 it was bought as lot No.128 for \u00a310,780,000 at Sotheby's auction in London, by Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza and his wife Carmen \"Tita\" Thyssen. This set a record for a British work of art, which it held until 2006 when a view of Venice by J. M. W. Turner, Constable's rival, sold for \u00a320.5m at Christie's in New York. From 1992, the couple placed the painting on loan to their museum, the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza in Madrid, Spain. It was part of the Baroness's personal collection rather than the main collection.\r In light of \"a lack of liquid funds\", the Baroness decided in 2011 to sell the painting. It was auctioned for \u00a322,441,250 at Christie's in London on 3 July 2012, following a low estimate of \u00a320million, making it the joint fourth on the list of most-expensive Old Masters. Museum trustee Sir Norman Rosenthal resigned in protest at the sale, saying that the decision to sell represented \".. a moral shame on the part of all those concerned, most especially on the part of Tita\"\r Constable made a copy of this painting, known as the Foster version, in 1825. This was the only copy of a painting from the Stour series he made, though later he commonly made copies of his most popular compositions, such as his views of Salisbury Cathedral. The Foster version remains in private hands, one of just three such major works by Constable, and was auctioned at Sotheby's London on the evening of 9 December 2015 on its low estimate at \u00a39,109,000.

It shows a man, manacled, on a stone bench and looking pensively or plaintively upward. Its subject matter, historical period, and mode of creation suggest the artist intended the painting as a statement against slavery. Until acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 2008, it had not been displayed to the public for 180 years.\r The three-quarter portrait shows a dark-skinned man in orange-red open collar clothing, sitting on a stone bench, against a muted background, with the sitter taking up most the frame. Large metallic manacles are visible around his wrists, which lie on his lap, and a heavy chain falls across the bench and out of the frame. The man is gazing up and to his left.\r At its original showing it was entitled, The Captive Slave, and the viewer is informed of the sitter's condition as a slave by the manacles and by his dark skin, which connects him to the African slave trade. His clothes suggest somewhat foreign origin but also prison garb. The features of the subject show the man as a recognizable individual person. The painting is described as a portrait but also a hybrid with genre painting, as the name of the character in the painting is unknown. His aspect is saintly or heroic, imploring, vulnerable, and somewhat passive in rest, which allowed the British viewer when the portrait was shown to safely sympathize or pity the subject and deplore his condition. While the portrait follows high art conventions for depicting the saintly or long suffering, portraits of individual slaves were rare in the European high art tradition.\r The artist, John Simpson, was a British portrait painter, who studied at the Royal Academies, and was a longtime assistant of the portraitist Thomas Lawrence. Today, Simpson is described as \"little known\". The painting was created on a used canvas that x-rays show had previously depicted a stately home and another portrait; this reuse suggests that the artist did not paint it on commission, which is how he made his living, but here he appears to have chosen the subject of his own volition. The portrait was displayed in London at the Royal Academy not once but twice, in 1827 and again in 1828; it was also displayed at an exhibition at the Liverpool Academy in 1828.\r In this period, Britain was debating whether to abolish slavery throughout its empire. The British slave trade had been outlawed in 1807, but abolition was still a pressing political question in the late 1820s. Against this background, the two London showings and the showing in Liverpool, \"a city synonymous with the slave trade, and whose merchants continued to prosper from [slavery]\" is seen as significant. The artist included lines of William Cowper' poetry in the first exhibition catalogue: \"Ah but! what wish can prosper or what prayer/for merchants rich in cargoes of despair\" (from the poem, Charity, 1784).

It was first exhibited at the British Institution in February 1821 and won a prize of \u00a3200 for the best picture. It was so popular that it needed to be protected from the crowds by a railing, and established Martin's fame. In the words of Martin's biographer William Feaver, he \"turned literary references to visual reality\". Martin published mezzotint engravings in 1826 and 1832. The original painting is now held in a private collection; two smaller contemporaneous \"sketches\" are held by the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, Connecticut and the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut.\r The Biblical episode depicted in the painting - Belshazzar's Feast - is described in the Book of Daniel. The Babylonian king Belshazzar is said to have defiled the sacred vessels of the enslaved Israelites by using them to serve wine at a banquet. The feast was then disturbed by the appearance of a divine hand which wrote a glowing inscription on a wall - the writing on the wall - which was interpreted by the prophet Daniel as a portent of Belshazzar's doom. Belshazzar was killed that night and Darius the Mede succeeded to his kingdom.\r The painting is the second piece in a trilogy of paintings by Martin on Mesopotamian themes, starting with his The Fall of Babylon in 1819, and completed with his The Fall of Ninevah in 1828. It was inspired by a conversation with the American artist Washington Allston and perhaps also by a poem by Thomas Smart Hughes.\r It shows a panoramic view of a cavernous banqueting room with columns to either side decorated with signs of the zodiac. The hall is filled with crowds of feasting Babylonians, and open to the sky, with the Hanging Gardens of Babylon above, and the Tower of Babel and a ziggurat visible in the background, lit by the moon revealed by a break in dark swirling clouds. The architecture is inspired by Egyptian, Babylonian and Indian styles. Dressed in black, Daniel stands at the centre of the foreground, interpreting the supernatural writing on the wall of the hall. Belshazzar recoils in astonishment and dread to his right, and others look on in shock and horror.\r Martin published an accompanying pamphlet with a key to help viewers to interpret the painting and identify the figures and structures. Although popular with the public, Martin's painting was not a critical success. There was appreciation of the magnificent architecture and emotional content, of the scale and bold colours of the work, but criticism of his painterly technique and particularly the execution of the figures. Charles Lamb called it vulgar and bombastic.\r Martin sold the painting to his former master, glass painter William Collins, for 1,000 guineas before the exhibition in 1821, and Collins made Martin agree not to reproduce the painting until Collins sold it. The Duke of Buckingham and Chandos offered Martin 800 guineas; disappointed, he commissioned Martin to paint The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum instead. Collins sent the painting on an extensive tour of Britain, and it was wildly successful. By 1826, the accompanying pamphlet had reached its 45th edition. Martin was preparing to publish an engraved version in 1826 when Collins sued under the agreement not to reproduce the painting. Martin successfully claimed that he was reproducing his preliminary sketches, not the finished work, and versions of his engraving were published in 1826, in 1832, and for his Illustrations of the Bible project in 1835\n", "\nArtist: John Martin\nArtwork Name: The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-martin/the-destruction-of-sodom-and-gomorrah-1852\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is a painting by the English painter John Martin from 1852.\r John Martin's painting, shows the biblical story of the destruction of the two cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, which was God's punishment for the two cities for people's immoral behavior. Only Lot and his daughters were saved. Lot's wife disobeyed God's instruction not to look back, and was turned into a pillar of salt.

It was commissioned as part of a series of three panels to hang in the Palace of Westminster in London. As one of the most popular paintings throughout the 19th century, it sold widely in reproductions in steel engraving, and was finally bought by companies to use in advertising. The painting had become something of a clich\u00e9 by the mid-20th century, as \"the ultimate biscuit tin image of Scotland: a bulky stag set against the violet hills and watery skies of an isolated wilderness\", according to the Sunday Herald.\r The stag has twelve points on his antlers, which in deer terminology makes him a \"royal stag\" but not a \"monarch stag\", for which sixteen points are needed.\r In 2017 the National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh launched a successful campaign to buy the painting for \u00a34 million, finally achieving the acquisition. The painting is now part of the collection, and is on display at the Scottish National Gallery in Room 12.\r Landseer was a member of the Royal Academy, a favourite of Queen Victoria, and had become famous for his paintings and drawings of animals. His later works include the sculptures of the lions at the foot of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square. From the 1840s, he produced a series of intricately observed studies of stags based on those he had seen on the trips he had been making to the Scottish Highlands since 1824. In 1850, Landseer received a national commission to paint three subjects connected with the chase for the Refreshment Rooms of the House of Lords, for which he produced Monarch of the Glen and two other paintings. Once they were completed the House of Commons refused to grant the \u00a3150 promised for the commission, and, as a result, the paintings were sold to private collectors. It has been claimed that the landscape setting shows Glen Affric.\r It was exhibited in London in 1851, 1874 and 1890. From the collection of William Denison, 1st Earl of Londesborough it passed in 1884 to Henry Eaton, 1st Baron Cheylesmore after whose death in 1891 it realized \u00a37,245 at his sale at Christie's in May 1892, where it was bought by Agnew's, who resold it to T. Barratt for \u00a38,000. In 1916 he resold it at Christie's for \u00a35,250. The price in 1892 was the highest made by a Landseer before the 1960s, with the exception of a rumoured price of \u00a310,000 in a private sale of The Otter Hunt in 1873, which would have then represented the highest price ever paid for a British painting.\r The painting was purchased in 1916 by Pears soap company and featured in their advertising. It was sold on to John Dewar & Sons distillery and became their trademark before similarly being used by Glenfiddich. The painting was then acquired as part of the purchase of Dewar's by Diageo. In 1997 Diageo sold Dewar's to Bacardi but this did not include ancillary assets.

The Courtship of Miles Standish is set in the year 1621 against the backdrop of a fierce Indian war and focuses on a love triangle among three Mayflower passengers: Miles Standish, Priscilla Mullins, and John Alden. Longfellow said that the story was true, but the historical evidence is inconclusive.  The poem was a literary counterpoint to Longfellow's earlier Evangeline (1847), the tragic tale of a woman whose lover disappears during the deportation of the Acadian people in 1755. Together, Evangeline and The Courtship of Miles Standish captured the bittersweet quality of America's colonial era. However, the plot of The Courtship of Miles Standish deliberately varies in emotional tone, unlike the steady tragedy of Longfellow's Evangeline. The Pilgrims grimly battle against disease and Indians, but are also obsessed with an eccentric love triangle, creating a curious mix of drama and comedy.  Bumbling, feuding roommates Miles Standish and John Alden vie for the affections of the beautiful Priscilla Mullins, who slyly tweaks the noses of her undiplomatic suitors.  The independent-minded woman utters the famous retort, \"Why don't you speak for yourself, John?\" The saga has a surprise ending, one full of optimism for the American future.  A debate persists as to whether the tale is fact or fiction. Main characters Miles Standish, John Alden, and Priscilla Mullins are based upon real Mayflower passengers. Longfellow was a descendant of John Alden and Priscilla Mullins through his mother Zilpah Wadsworth and he claimed that he was relating oral history. Skeptics dismiss his narrative as a folktale. At minimum, Longfellow used poetic license, condensing several years of events. Scholars have confirmed the cherished place of romantic love in Pilgrim culture, and have documented the Indian war described by Longfellow. Miles Standish and John Alden were likely roommates in Plymouth; Priscilla Mullins was the only single woman of marriageable age in the young colony at that time and did in fact marry Alden. Standish's first wife, Rose Handley, died aboard the Mayflower in January 1621. Two years later, Standish married a woman named Barbara in Plymouth in 1623. The Standish and Alden families both moved from Plymouth to adjacent Duxbury, Massachusetts in the late 1620s, where they lived in close proximity, intermarried, and remained close for several generations. Upon his death in 1656, Standish's widow, Barbara, appointed John Alden to take inventory of Standish's estate.  The first reference to the poem recorded in Longfellow's journal is dated December 29, 1857, where the project is referred to as \"Priscilla\". By March 1 the next year, it was renamed The Courtship of Miles Standish.  The ballad was very popular in nineteenth-century America. It was published in book form on October 16, 1858, and it sold 25,000 copies after two months. Reportedly, 10,000 copies were sold in London in a single day.  Standish is memorialized in a low relief sculpture of six characters from Longfellow's epic poems executed by Daniel Chester French and installed at Longfellow Park, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, located in front of Longfellow's former home, now a U.S. National Historic site maintained by the National Park Service.\n", "\nArtist: George Frederick Watts\nArtwork Name: Hope\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/george-frederick-watts/hope-1886\n\nWikipedia Article:\nHope is a Symbolist oil painting by the English painter George Frederic Watts, who completed the first two versions in 1886. Radically different from previous treatments of the subject, it shows a lone blindfolded female figure sitting on a globe, playing a lyre that has only a single string remaining. The background is almost blank, its only visible feature a single star. Watts intentionally used symbolism not traditionally associated with hope to make the painting's meaning ambiguous. While his use of colour in Hope was greatly admired, at the time of its exhibition many critics disliked the painting. Hope proved popular with the Aesthetic Movement, who considered beauty the primary purpose of art and were unconcerned by the ambiguity of its message. Reproductions in platinotype, and later cheap carbon prints, soon began to be sold.\r Although Watts received many offers to buy the painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works to the nation and felt it would be inappropriate not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.\r As cheap reproductions of Hope, and from 1908 high-quality prints, began to circulate in large quantities, it became a widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and an imagined story behind it. By this time Hope was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion. In 1938 the Tate Gallery ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.\r Despite the decline in Watts's popularity, Hope remained influential. Martin Luther King Jr. based a 1959 sermon, now known as Shattered Dreams, on the theme of the painting, as did Jeremiah Wright in Chicago in 1990. Among the congregation for the latter was the young Barack Obama, who was deeply moved. Obama took \"The Audacity of Hope\" as the theme of his 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address, and as the title of his 2006 book; he based his successful 2008 presidential campaign around the theme of \"Hope\".\r George Frederic Watts was born in London in 1817, the son of a musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823 and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Meanwhile, his father's strict evangelical Christianity led to both a deep knowledge of the Bible and a strong dislike of organised religion. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and six years later was proficient enough as an artist to earn a living as a portrait painter and cricket illustrator. Aged 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. In 1837 Watts was commissioned by Greek shipping magnate Alexander Constantine Ionides to copy a portrait of his father by Samuel Lane; Ionides preferred Watts's version to the original and immediately commissioned two more paintings from him, allowing Watts to devote himself full-time to painting.\n", "\nArtist: Richard Dadd\nArtwork Name: The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke\nArtwork Genre: literary painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/richard-dadd/the-fairy-feller-s-master-stroke-1864\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke is a painting by English artist Richard Dadd. It was begun in 1855 and worked on until 1864. Dadd painted it while incarcerated in the State Criminal Lunatic Asylum of Bethlem Royal Hospital, where he was confined after he murdered his father in 1843. It was commissioned by George Henry Haydon, who was head steward at Bethlem Royal Hospital at the time.\r Dadd had begun his career as a painter of fairy paintings before the onset of his mental illness. After he was committed, he was encouraged to resume painting. G. H. Haydon was impressed by Dadd's artistic efforts and asked for a fairy painting of his own. Dadd worked on the painting for nine years, paying microscopic attention to detail and using a layering technique to produce 3D-like results. Although it is generally regarded as his most important work, Dadd himself considered the painting to be unfinished (the background of the lower left corner is only sketched in).\r He signed the back of the canvas with the inscription: \"The Fairy-Feller's Master-Stroke, Painted for G. H. Haydon Esqre by Rd. Dadd quasi 1855\u201364\". According to Patricia Allderidge, 'quasi' \"may mean that it was set aside during that period or that it took a long time to start\". The end date, 1864, coincides with Dadd's transfer to Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire, the asylum where he spent the remaining 21 years of his life.\r In order to give context to his work, Dadd subsequently wrote a long poem by the name of Elimination of a Picture & its Subject\u2014called The Fellers' Master Stroke in which each of the characters appearing in the picture is given a name and purpose\u2014including myriad references to old English folklore and Shakespeare\u2014in an apparent attempt to show that the painting's unique composition was not merely a product of random, wild inspiration.\r The painting is in the Tate Britain collection. It was presented to the Tate by the war poet Siegfried Sassoon in memory of his friend and fellow officer Julian Dadd, a great-nephew of the artist, and of his two brothers who gave their lives in the First World War.\r The Queen song \"The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke\" from the album Queen II was born of Freddie Mercury's appreciation of the work; it makes direct reference to the painting's characters as detailed in Dadd's poem.\r Terry Pratchett's novel The Wee Free Men contains a scene inspired by the painting.\r The painting, the art of the insane, and Dadd are mentioned in the novel, Mortal Love, by Elizabeth Hand.\r The work is a central plot element in the novel The Witches of Chiswick by Robert Rankin.\r Neil Gaiman wrote a tribute to the painting for Intelligent Life (July/August 2013)\r The painting appears in Alex Bledsoe's Tufa novels.\r The painting is an attributed plot element in Mike Shevdon's The Road to Bedlam, Book II of his The Courts of the Feyre series.\r Former Gorky's Zygotic Mynci singer Euros Childs included an instrumental song titled \"The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke\" on his 2009 solo album, Son of Euro Child.\r Mark Chadbourn's \"The Fairy Feller's Master Stroke\", about a contemporary young man looking for meanings in the painting, won the British Fantasy Award for best short story in 2003.\n", "\nArtist: Dante Gabriel Rossetti\nArtwork Name: The Childhood of Mary Virgin\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/the-childhood-of-mary-virgin-1849\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Girlhood of Mary Virgin is an 1849 oil on canvas painting by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti, measuring 83.2 by 65.4 cm and now in the collection of Tate Britain, to which it was bequeathed in 1937 by Agnes Jekyll. It was his first completed oil painting and is signed \"Dante Gabriele Rossetti P.R.B. 1849\". He first exhibited it at the 'Free Exhibition' at the Hyde Park Corner Gallery.\r Rossetti began the work in summer 1848, working hard and aiming to have it completed for exhibition in March 1849. In November 1848 he mentioned his choice of subject in a letter to his father's friend, Charles Lyell of Kinnordy, stating that it would definitely appeal to members of a religious community. It was a common subject in medieval and renaissance art and usually shows Mary with a book on her lap as her mother, Anne, teaches her to read. But instead Rossetti shows Mary embroidering a lily (traditional symbol of Mary's purity) under Anne's guidance while her father, Joachim, prunes a vine in the background, referring to the coming of Christ (who calls himself \"the True Vine\" in John 15.1). The vine is shaped like a cross, prefiguring Christ's passion.\r Rossetti made several preliminary chalk studies in chalk and the Scottish poet and artist William Bell Scott saw the work in progress in Hunt's studio and remarked on young Rossetti's technique:\r The models were sourced from close to home - Anne was portrayed by Rossetti's mother Frances, his sister Christina Georgina modelled for Mary, and the family servant Williams for Joachim. The angel's face was originally based on the half-sister of Thomas Woolner (1825-1892), but in August 1849 Rossetti replaced her features with those of another girl, recommended to him by his fellow Pre-Raphaelite James Collinson (1825-1881).\r Rossetti wrote two sonnets to explain the painting's symbolism - the first was engraved at the bottom of the original frame, whilst the second was printed in the Free Exhibition catalogue. A crossed palm branch on the floor refers to Palm Sunday and Good Friday and the pale roses and thorn-shaped branches on the wall to Christ's passion and Mary's seven joys and seven sorrows. The oil lamp symbolises piety, three of the books are in colours symbolising the three cardinal virtues and the rose is another symbol of Mary (the 'rose without a thorn'). The Annunciation is prefigured by a dove, symbolising the Holy Spirit,\r It received a generally good reception and reviews at the Free Exhibition. It was bought for \u00a380 by Louisa, marchioness of Bath, wife of John Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath and a family friend of the Rossettis - Rossetti repainted Mary's dress and the angel's face before sending the work to her, whilst the payment for it funded a trip to Belgium and France by him and William Holman Hunt. It was exhibited again in 1850 in the Portland Gallery Exhibitions at the Royal Academy, where it received a less friendly reception. By 1864 it was owned by Lady Louise Fielding, who that year sent it back to Rossetti for repainting - he turned the angel's wings from white to deep pink and Mary's sleeves from yellow to brown. The original frame with its rounded upper corners was also replaced by a rectangular frame with both of Rossetti's sonnets on its base.\n", "\nArtist: Dante Gabriel Rossetti\nArtwork Name: Bocca Baciata\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/bocca-baciata-1859\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBocca Baciata (1859) is a painting by Dante Gabriel Rossetti which represents a turning point in his career. It was the first of his pictures of single female figures, and established the style that was later to become a signature of his work. The model was Fanny Cornforth, the principal inspiration for Rossetti's sensuous figures.  The title, meaning \"mouth that has been kissed\", refers to the sexual experience of the subject and is taken from the Italian proverb written on the back of the painting:  Rossetti, an accomplished translator of early Italian literature, probably knew the proverb from Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron  where it is used as the culmination of the tale of Alatiel: a beautiful Saracen princess who, despite having had sex on perhaps ten thousand occasions with eight separate lovers in the space of four years, successfully presents herself to the King of the Algarve as his virgin bride.  Rossetti explained in a letter to William Bell Scott that he was attempting to paint flesh more fully, and to \"avoid what I know to be a besetting fault of mine - & indeed rather common to PR painting - that of stipple in the flesh...Even among the old good painters, their portraits and simpler pictures are almost always their masterpieces for colour and execution; and I fancy if one kept this in view, one might have a better chance of learning to paint at last.\"  The painting may have been influenced by Millais's portrait of his sister-in-law Sophie Gray, completed two years earlier.\n", "\nArtist: Dante Gabriel Rossetti\nArtwork Name: The Beloved\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/the-beloved-1866\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Beloved (also The Bride) is an oil painting on canvas by English artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti, first painted in 1865 and currently housed at Tate Britain.\r This painting illustrates the Song of Solomon. Two passages from the Song of Solomon are inscribed on the picture's gilded frame:\r and\r The bride, caught in the action of moving back her veil, is attended by four virginal bridesmaids and an African page boy. All contrast strikingly with the red hair and pale skin of the bride: not just the African skin and features, but also the varying shades of brunette hair and dark caucasian skin tones of all four bridesmaids. It has been suggested that this colour contrast, carefully painted as a frame to the bride's features, was influenced by a controversial painting by \u00c9douard Manet, entitled Olympia (first exhibited in 1865). Rossetti made a visit to Manet while working on The Beloved, and the painting also owes much to the works of Titian.\r Rossetti arranged the bride in a head-dress which is distinctly recognisable as Peruvian, and in a Japanese gown. Again, this abundance of exotic fabric frames the face of the bride, dominant in the centre of the canvas, with its western-European features.

Monna Rosa's peacock background and blue and white Chinese porcelain are similar to the themes in The Peacock Room that Whistler later created for Leyland.\r Henry Currie Marillie describe the painting in 1904 as a \"small but pretty picture\" and a \"study in beautiful colour.\" Red and gold highlight the roses, Leyland's dress, jewellery, and hair, as well as the flower pot and peacock screen in the background.

It recalls Rossetti's collector's passion for oriental ware and even his penchant for translation \u2013 in this case translating a Chinese pot to an English painting.\r Monna Rosa was among the first of eighteen paintings Leyland commissioned from Rossetti, not counting unfulfilled commissions. Soon after acquiring the painting, they explored the idea of a Rossetti triptych, which was eventually formed with Mnemosyne, The Blessed Damozel, and Proserpine.

This work was painted at the start of Rossetti's affair with Jane Morris, who modelled for the picture. As he was to do with Beata Beatrix (1870), Rossetti chose a tale by Dante Aligheri (from Purgatorio) to illustrate his love for his model. The story tells of a woman whose husband imprisoned and later poisoned her: Rossetti wanted the world to believe the fantasy with which he was deluding himself - that William Morris kept Jane against her will. He continued this theme, as shown in Proserpine.  Rossetti not only drew Jane exhaustively, he also choreographed photographic sessions of her and used the photographs as preliminary sketches for drawings. Amongst other representations of her, Rossetti depicts Jane as Proserpine, Queen Guinevere and Desdemona - all of whom were at the mercy of men.  Jane appears disproportionately large in most of Rossetti's pictures. The background is immaterial as long as the viewer focuses on the beauty of her face. In Pia de' Tolomei her elongated neck seems almost dislocated, and the whiteness of her skin shines out, defying the viewer to pay attention to any other aspects of the painting. Miller's hair colour is misrepresented in the painting. Her natural colour was dark brown, yet Rossetti paints it with an auburn tinge - closer to Lizzie Siddal's hair colour than Miller's.

It depicts Beatrice Portinari from Dante Alighieri's poem La Vita Nuova at the moment of her death. The painting's title in English translates to 'Blessed Beatrice'. La Vita Nuova had been a story that Rossetti had found of interest from childhood and he had begun work translating it into English in 1845 and published it in his work, The Early Italian Poets.\r Rossetti modeled Beatrice after his deceased wife and frequent model, Elizabeth Siddal, who died in 1862. The painting was created from the numerous drawings that Rossetti had made of Siddal during their time together. The symbolism in the painting of a red dove, a messenger of love, relates back to Rossetti's love for Siddal with the white poppy representing laudanum and the means of her death. Several of Siddal's friends found the painting to bear little resemblance to the drawings of her\u2014the facial features were harder and the neck is out of proportion. Beata Beatrix is one of Rossetti's most recognized works and has made Siddal's name to be one that is frequently linked with Dante Alighieri's Beatrice.\r In an 1873 letter to his friend William Morris, Rossetti said he intended the painting \"not as a representation of the incident of the death of Beatrice, but as an ideal of the subject, symbolized by a trance or sudden spiritual transfiguration.\"\r This painting is on display in the Tate Britain. It was a gift in memory of Francis, Baron Mount-Temple by his wife, Georgiana in 1889.\r Rossetti was commissioned by William Graham to make a replica of Beata Beatrix. This oil replica, dated 1872, is almost the same size as the original but has a predella depicting Dante Alighieri and Beatrice meeting in paradise with a frame designed by Rossetti. It was given by bequest and on display at the Art Institute of Chicago.\r Several other replica works were made by Rossetti of Beata Beatrix\u2014a watercolor, a chalk drawing and another oil painting that was begun in 1877. This replica was still unfinished at the time of his death. His lifelong friend, Ford Madox Brown, completed it.

It depicts Jane Morris in the river landscape near Kelmscott Manor, with the manor in the left background and Kelmscott Church below the hill to the right.\r In May 1871, William Morris rented Kelmscott Manor, a 17th-century limestone manor house along the Thames near Kelmscott in Oxfordshire, to be a summer escape from London. Rossetti shared the lease, but the house soon became a retreat for Rossetti and Morris's wife Jane to have a long-lasting and complicated liaison. The two spent an idyllic summer there, with the Morris children, in 1871, while Morris himself travelled to Iceland. Rossetti made a version of Water Willow in coloured chalks at Kelmscott, and then painted the small oil \"to fit a beautiful old frame I have\" In the chalk study, Jane holds a pansy, symbol of love and remembrance, rather than the willow branches, a symbol of sorrow and longing, of the final painting.\r In 1877, facing financial difficulties, Rossetti sold the painting to \"a new buyer\", William Alfred Turner (1839\u20131886), a Manchester cotton spinner, who also purchased Proserpine at that time. Rossetti apologized to Jane Morris for selling the work, saying he was \"really mortally sorry to part with the Kelmscott picture\" but \"felt there was no alternative\".\r After Turner's death, the painting was sold at auction by Christie's on 28 April 1888 and was bought in by his executors. Water Willow was the first Pre-Raphaelite painting acquired by the American collector Samuel Bancroft, who purchased it in 1890. Bancroft later sent the painting back to England to be repaired by Charles Fairfax Murray. Murray asked and received Bancroft's permission to make a copy that he gave to Jane Morris, because \"she was to have had the picture, it being a great favourite of hers.\" The original was bequeathed to the Delaware Art Museum by Bancroft's descendants in 1935.\r The painting was exhibited in Manchester in 1882 and again in 1887, London in 1883, and Philadelphia in 1892.

It hangs in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.\r Rossetti had a lifelong interest in the Italian poet Dante Alighieri. The painting was inspired by Dante's poem La Vita Nuova. In this poem Dante dreams that he is led to the death-bed of Beatrice Portinari, who was the object of his unfulfilled love. Dante, in black, stands looking towards the dying Beatrice who is lying on a bed. Two female figures in green hold a canopy over her. An angel in red holds Dante's hand and leans forward to kiss Beatrice.\r In the painting, Rossetti creates a visionary world with complex symbols. The symbols include the green clothes of Beatrice's attendants, signifying hope; spring flowers in the foreground symbolising purity; and red doves for love.\r It is Rossetti's largest painting. The model for Beatrice was Jane Morris, the wife of William Morris. Annie Miller, who is thought to have been one of Rossetti's mistresses, posed as a grieving hand maiden. The Walker Art Gallery bought the painting directly from the artist in 1881 for \u00a31575 (equivalent to \u00a3150,000 in 2016). The acquisition was negotiated by Victorian novelist Hall Caine. In 1897 it was sent to Berlin to be photographed, but was then noted to be \"in a dirty condition\". Again in 1904 the painting was noted to be in \"a bad condition\" and it was considered that its condition had been worsened by its journey to and from Berlin. The painting was sent in 1908 to the National Gallery in London to be relined, that is, for a new canvas to the glued to the original. It was then returned to Liverpool. During the Second World War, it was removed from its stretcher, rolled and stored in the basement of the gallery. In 1941 the painting was moved, together with other large paintings from the gallery, to Ellesmere College in Shropshire. It was noted at this time that it had sustained some damage.

In 1923 it was acquired by the estate of Samuel Bancroft which donated it in 1935 to the Delaware Art Museum where it is now displayed.\r Like much of Rossetti's work of the 1860s and 1870s, Veronica Veronese was inspired by Venetian painting. It is believed to represent \u201cthe artistic soul in the act of creation.\u201d This theme is expounded by the fictitious quote inscribed on the frame of the painting. Though the quote is attributed on the frame to \"The Letters of Girolamo Ridolfi,\" critics believe that Algernon Charles Swinburne or Rossetti actually wrote it.\r The symbolism in the painting includes the uncaged bird, which may represent \"the marriage of the voices of nature and the soul\" and overt flower symbolism. The camomile in the bird cage may represent \u201cenergy in adversity,\u201d the primroses youth, and the daffodils reflection.\r Jane Morris lent the green dress in the picture. The violin was part of Rossetti's collection of musical instruments, and the fan also appeared in Monna Vanna.

Lady Lilith represents the body's beauty, according to Rossetti's sonnet inscribed on the frame. Sibylla Palmifera represents the soul's beauty, according to the Rossetti sonnet on its frame.\r A large 1867 replica of Lady Lilith, painted by Rossetti in watercolor, which shows the face of Cornforth, is now owned by New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. It has a verse from Goethe's Faust as translated by Shelley on a label attached by Rossetti to its frame:\r On 9 April 1866 Rossetti wrote to Frederick Leyland:\r Lady Lilith was commissioned by Leyland in early 1866 and delivered to him in early 1869 at a price of \u00a3472. 10 s. Two studies, dated to 1866, exist for the work, but two notebook sketches may be from an earlier date. The painting focuses on Lilith, but is meant to be a \"Modern Lilith\" rather than the mythological figure. She contemplates her own beauty in her hand-mirror. The painting is one of a series of Rossetti paintings of such \"mirror pictures.\" Other painters soon followed with their own mirror pictures with narcissistic female figures, but Lady Lilith has been considered \"the epitome\" of the type.\r Rossetti's assistant, Henry Treffry Dunn, states that the final part painted was the flowery background. He and G. P. Boyce gathered large baskets of white roses from John Ruskin's garden in Denmark Hill, and returned with them to Rossetti's house in Chelsea. Dunn is thought to have later recreated Rossetti's picture of Lady Lilith in coloured chalk.\r Sources disagree on whether Leyland or Rossetti initiated the repainting, but the major change was the substitution of Alexa Wilding's face for Cornforth's. The painting was returned to Rossetti in February 1872, and he completed the repainting on 2 December at Kelmscott Manor before returning it to Leyland. Alexa was born Alice Wilding and was about 27 years old at the time of the repainting. Rossetti paid her a retainer of \u00a31 per week for modelling. Wilding's face had earlier replaced the face in another painting Venus Verticordia. Despite Rossetti's record of serial liaisons with his models, there is little or no evidence of a romantic attachment between Wilding and Rossetti.\n", "\nArtist: Dante Gabriel Rossetti\nArtwork Name: Proserpine\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/proserpine-1874\n\nWikipedia Article:\nProserpine (also Proserpina) is an oil painting on canvas by English artist and poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti, painted in 1874 and currently housed at Tate Britain.\r In his Proserpine, the artist illustrates in his typical Pre-Raphaelite style the Roman goddess who lives in the underworld during Winter. Although Rossetti inscribed the date 1874 on the picture, he worked for seven years on eight separate canvases before he finished with it. His Proserpine, like his model Jane Morris, is an exquisitely beautiful woman, with delicate facial features, slender hands, and flawlessly pale skin set off by her thick raven hair. Rossetti painted it at a time when his mental health was extremely precarious and his love for Jane Morris was at its most obsessive.\r Rossetti wrote about Proserpine\r Unable to decide as a young man whether to concentrate on painting or poetry, his work is infused with his poetic imagination and an individual interpretation of literary sources. His accompanying sonnet to this work is a poem of longing: \"And still some heart unto some soul doth pine,\" (see sonnet below) carrying an inescapable allusion to his yearning to seduce Jane from her unhappy marriage with William Morris. Proserpine had been imprisoned in Pluto's underground realm for tasting the forbidden pomegranate. Jane, trapped by convention, was also tasting forbidden fruit. There is a deeper meaning in the painting as Rossetti stayed with Jane at Kelmscott Manor during the summer months each year and in winter she returned to stay with William Morris, thus paralleling Proserpine's freedom during summer.\r In Greek and Roman mythology, Proserpine daughter of Ceres, was carried off to the Underworld (Hades) by Pluto, who married her despite her love for Adonis. When Ceres begged Jupiter to return her daughter to Earth, he agreed, on condition that Proserpine had not eaten any fruits in Hades. As Proserpine had eaten six pomegranate seeds, it was decreed that she should remain in Hades for six months of the year and be allowed on Earth for the other six.\r The symbolism in Rossetti's painting poignantly indicates Proserpine's plight, as well as Jane Morris's plight, torn between her husband, the father of her two adored daughters, and her lover. The pomegranate draws the viewer's eye, the colour of its flesh matching the colour of Proserpine's full lips. The ivy behind her, as Rossetti stated, represents clinging memory and the passing of time; the shadow on the wall is her time in Hades, the patch of sunlight, her glimpse of earth. Her dress, like spilling water, suggests the turning of the tides, and the incense burner denotes the subject as an immortal. Proserpine's saddened eyes, which are the same cold blue color as most of the painting, indirectly stare at the other realm. Overall, dark hues characterise the color scheme of the piece.\r On the top right of the canvas \"Proserpina\" is inscribed by the artist, followed by his sonnet in Italian. The same sonnet in English is inscribed on the frame:\r The painting is signed and dated on a scroll at lower left: 'DANTE GABRIELE ROSSETTI RITRASSE NEL CAPODANNO DEL 1874' (in Italian) (Dante Gabriel Rossetti painted this at the beginning of 1874). The frame, designed by Rossetti, has roundels which resemble a section of a pomegranate, reflecting the sliced pomegranate in Proserpine's hand.\n", "\nArtist: Dante Gabriel Rossetti\nArtwork Name: A Sea Spell\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/a-sea-spell-1877\n\nWikipedia Article:\nA Sea\u2013Spell is an 1877 oil painting and accompanying 1869 sonnet by English artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti, depicting a siren playing an instrument to lure sailors. It is currently on display in the Harvard Art Museums in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\r The painting depicts a siren in human form playing a musical instrument \"in a thoughtful reverie\", surrounded by apples, apple blossoms, and a seagull. The instrument being played as been described as a harp and as \"somewhat related to the psaltery\"; according to an analysis published in the journal Music in Art, it is an unusually short Japanese koto, a traditional 13-stringed zither-like instrument.\r Rossetti's brother described the subject as \"a Siren, or Sea-Fairy, whose lute summons a sea-bird to listen, and whose song will prove fatal to some fascinated mariner.\"\r In 1873, Rossetti made a drawing of a sea-maiden playing an instrument, titled Ligeia Siren, as a preliminary study for A Sea\u2013Spell. He had begun work on the painting itself by 18 August 1875. His brother William Michael Rossetti wrote that Gabriel painted the work, along with another half-length figure painting called The Roman Widow, after his patron Frederick Richards Leyland \"suggested\" that he was interested in buying several such paintings. Leyland later denied making a commitment to do so.\r The model was Alexa Wilding, one of Rossetti's several muses. A Sea\u2013Spell was a companion to Veronica Veronese, for which Wilding also modeled. Rossetti was assisted by an unidentified naturalist in finding and positioning the stuffed seagull used in the painting, which led to some delay.\r Rossetti wrote a sonnet in 1869 as a \"double\" of the painting completed years later, as he did for several other works in the same period. The text of the poem is as follows:\r Jerome McGann wrote that the painting is a \"failure\", caused by Rossetti's excessive intellectualizing of his work; previous critics suggested, to the contrary, that the work is flawed due to Rossetti's \"slipshod\" execution.\r Scholar Helene E. Roberts wrote that the painting is one of a group of depictions of Rossetti's \"ideal woman\". She wrote that the iconic image of womanhood dominated Rossetti's \"dream world\", and that the painting is intended to evoke similar reveries in the viewer, citing its musical theme as a prompt for \"indolent musing\". She argued that, although the combination of daydreaming and womanhood in A Sea\u2013Spell could be pornographic, Rossetti encourages more spiritual responses, emphasizing the subject's face and making her exposed arms \"masculine, or at best matronly\".\r Lucien Agosta argued that the piece illustrates a theme in Rossetti's work of Art as independent of, and triumphant over, Nature. He noted that Rossetti, in a letter, had written that the subject's song was a \"magic lay\" and that the sonnet describes unnatural \"netherland gulf-whispers\", and that the siren's attraction of a bird to listen to her song inverts the relationship of Veronica Veronese, in which the musician is inspired by a bird.\r The painting was owned by Leyland, who may have acquired it from Rossetti, and sold through Christie's in 1892. It was owned by T. F. Wigley, David Croal Thomson, and William Hulme, Viscount Leverhulme, who sold it in 1926 through Anderson Galleries of New York, who sold it to another New York dealer, Scott & Fowles, from whom lawyer and art collector Grenville L. Winthrop purchased it in 1935. Winthrop donated the work to the Fogg Art Museum of his alma mater, Harvard University, in 1939.\n", "\nArtist: Dante Gabriel Rossetti\nArtwork Name: A Vision of Fiammetta\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/a-vision-of-fiammetta-1878\n\nWikipedia Article:\nA Vision of Fiammetta is an oil painting created by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, in the Pre-Raphaelite style, created in 1878.

The poem was first published in 1850 in the Pre-Raphaelite journal The Germ. Rossetti subsequently revised the poem twice and republished it in 1856, 1870 and 1873. \r The poem was partially inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"The Raven\", with its depiction of a lover grieving on Earth over the death of his loved one. Rossetti chose to represent the situation in reverse. The poem describes the damozel observing her lover from heaven, and her unfulfilled yearning for their reunion in heaven.\r The poem also was the inspiration for Claude Debussy's La Damoiselle \u00e9lue (1888), a cantata for two soloists, female choir, and orchestra.\r The first four stanzas of the poem are inscribed on the frame of the painting.\r The Blessed Damozel is the only one of Rossetti's paired pictures and poems in which the poem was completed first. Friends and patrons repeatedly urged Rossetti to illustrate his most famous poem, and he finally accepted a commission from William Graham in February 1871. After the work was completed Graham requested a predella, the lower part of the painting, on December 31, 1877. His total cost was \u00a31157. Alexa Wilding modelled the damozel in Paradise, Wilfred John Hawtrey modelled the child\u2013angel, and the probable model for the left\u2013hand angel was May Morris. Another, later version is in the Lady Lever Art Gallery.\r Frederick Richards Leyland commissioned eighteen paintings from Rossetti, not counting unfulfilled commissions. Soon after Leyland acquired his first Rossetti painting, he and Rossetti explored the idea of a Rossetti triptych, which was eventually formed with Mnemosyne, an 1879 replica of The Blessed Damozel painted by Rossetti himself, and Proserpine. Three additional Rossetti paintings were then hung in Leyland's drawing room, all of which Leyland called \"stunners.\"\r Several pieces of music were based on the poem, including those for orchestra by Debussy, Granville Bantock (1891), Edgar Bainton (1907), Ernest Farrar (1907); for piano by Arnold Bax (1906); for string quartet by Benjamin Burrows (1927); and a 1928 choral by Julius Harrison.

The work, which measures 158.7 centimetres (62.5\u00a0in) in height by 92.7 centimetres (36.5\u00a0in) wide, was undertaken in 1880 and depicts Jane Morris posed in a seated position on the bough of a sycamore tree. A small stem of honeysuckle is in her hand, a token of love in the Victorian era, that may be an indication of the secret affair the artist was immersed in with her at the time. The artwork was left to the Victoria and Albert Museum by Constantine Alexander Ionides in 1900.\r During 1878 Rossetti completed a chalk sketch of Morris, his secret lover, whom he had met at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in 1857. She was the model for several of his well-known paintings, including Proserpine. The drawing was displayed above the mantlepiece in Rossetti's studio. Initially the painting was to be called Monna Primavera, or Vanna Primavera, possibly inspired by La Vita Nuova, a narrative that captivated Rossetti and was the basis for earlier pieces of his works of art. Rossetti was also a poet and penned sonnets to accompany several of his paintings; the last composition in his series entitled Sonnets for Pictures is associated with this painting. The sonnet reads:\r Rossetti had not initially been fully satisfied with the painting and he made several revisions to it. He wrote to Morris apologising for copying the feet of another woman to the picture. An earlier painting of Morris, entitled The Salutation of Beatrice, had similarly used a different model's hands in the final version.\r Morris is posed in seated position on the bough of a sycamore tree. A small stem of honeysuckle is in her hand, a token of love in the Victorian era and may be an indication of the secret affair the artist was immersed in with her at the time. Unusually for Rossetti work during this time \u2013 this is one of his last paintings \u2013 the model is pictured full length. The painting is signed \"D. Rossetti 1880\" on the lower right.\r The scene is a representation of a young woman in a green silk dress, shaded by the arabesque of the winged sycamore tree's leaves. Above her head and around her the tree branches are depicted almost embracing her, or as if she was emerging from the tree itself, almost as a dryad, or tree nymph. She is portrayed clad all in green, her dress is a romantic wide and loose silk robe, flowing in graceful folds down, blending in with the tree's leaves, that connects the subject and its surroundings visually. She is immersed in her day dreams, turning her gaze downwards, away, towards something unseen or perhaps only perceived by her. The depiction of the young, elegant woman in her shelter surrounded by the branches, is adding to the secretive feeling of the painting, maybe indicating the furtiveness of the affair or a clandestine meeting place. In the shelter it is dark, but around her shoulder there is light, light blue compartments against a dark green background, signalling that it is daytime.\n", "\nArtist: Dante Gabriel Rossetti\nArtwork Name: Mnemosyne\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/mnemosyne-1881\n\nWikipedia Article:\nMnemosyne, also titled Lamp of Memory and Ricordanza, is an oil painting by Dante Gabriel Rossetti begun in 1875 or early 1876 and completed in 1881. Jane Morris was the model, and Frederick Richards Leyland bought the painting in 1881 and displayed it in his drawing room with five other Rossetti \"stunners.\" At about the same time Rossetti, a founder of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, was painting Astarte Syriaca, a larger painting completed in 1877 with Morris in a very similar pose.\r Mnemosyne began as an oil study for Astarte Syriaca, for which Jane Morris sat over the winter of 1875\u20131876, but Rossetti later worked it up as an image of Mnemosyne, the Greek personification of Memory. Rossetti wrote to his mother about the two paintings on 29 April 1876:\r A month later Rossetti was considering ordering a frame for the painting and selling it to Clarence Fry. Fry declined and in July 1876 Leyland advanced Rossetti 300 pounds for the painting, although he was concerned that the painting was too large for his drawing room. Rossetti did further work on the painting in 1879 and adjusted the frame in 1880, before delivering it to Leyland in 1881. It was one of Rossetti's last completed canvases.\r Inscribed on the picture's frame is:\r Frederick Richards Leyland bought the painting from Rossetti in 1881.

Mary Magdalene was the only figure from the Bible that Sandys ever painted. Having sharp features reminiscent of Lizzie Siddal (though the model is unknown), Mary is depicted in front of a patterned forest-green damask. She holds an alabaster ointment cup, a traditional attribute which associates her with the unnamed sinful woman who anointed Jesus' feet in Luke 7:37. Like other Pre-Raphaelite painters, Frederick Sandys gave Magdalene a sensual look.   Dante Rossetti accused Sandys of plagiarism, because of the resemblance to his Mary Magdalene Leaving the House of Feasting, but when Rossetti came to paint Magdalene some twenty years later, it was his painting that resembled Sandys.  Mary Magdalene was acquired in 1894 by Samuel Bancroft, the most important American collector of Pre-Raphaelite art, whose family donated his collection to the Delaware Art Museum in 1935.

The painting was originally titled Orlando.\r The painting depicts a curate and his fianc\u00e9e in a woodland setting.\r The title refers to middle class social conventions of the time, in particular the fact that the parents of a girl engaged to a poorly paid curate would typically not allow the marriage until he had secured a more remunerative position \u2013 i.e. within the church hierarchy. The girl is depicted looking at her own name (Amy) carved, some while ago, into the trunk of the tree by her fianc\u00e9 as an expression of his love. The carving, however, is about to be covered by rambling ivy growing up the trunk; ethereal youthful passion is becoming lost to worldly capitalist demands. It can be said that this symbolism reflects the stark realities of late 1850s and 1860s Victorian England, which certainly is the observation made by English historian A. N. Wilson. In his book The Victorians (London: Arrow Books, 2003), Wilson makes the following observation and analysis of the significance of The Long Engagement:\r It depicts an emotional predicament stemming directly from an economic situation. The prosperity which had created the vast bourgeoisie with its gradations from lower to upper middle class had also created a code. You could not marry, and maintain the position in society to which you aspired, until you had a certain amount of money in the bank. (p.\u00a0260)\r Hughes had finished an earlier painting, April Love, of a similar theme.

The painting has been reproduced many times and is considered an iconic representation of the battle itself, and of heroism more generally.\r Butler was inspired to paint the charge as a response to the aesthetic paintings that she saw - and intensely disliked - on a visit to the Grosvenor Gallery. She had developed a reputation for her military pictures after the favourable reception of her earlier painting The Roll Call of 1874, on a subject from the Crimean War, and her 1879 painting Remnants of an Army, on the 1842 retreat from Kabul.\r Although Butler had never observed a battle, she was permitted to watch her husband's regiment during training manoeuvres, positioning herself in front of charging horses in order to observe their movement. In reality however, it appears that the Scots Greys did not start the charge at a gallop, due to the broken ground, and instead advanced at a quick walk. The horses which dominate the picture are the heavy grey mounts used by the regiment throughout its history until mechanisation. The title comes from the battle cry of the soldiers - the Greys called \"Now, my boys, Scotland forever!\" as they charged.\r The painting was exhibited at the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly in 1881. Tzar Nicholas II of Russia and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany both received copies and later during the First World War both the British and the Germans used the image in their propaganda material, with the Scots Greys transformed into Prussian cavalry by the Germans.\r In 1888 Colonel Thomas Walter Harding donated the painting to Leeds Art Gallery. It was used as an inspiration for the depiction of the same charge in the film Waterloo.\n", "\nArtist: John William Waterhouse\nArtwork Name: Sleep and His Half Brother Death\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-william-waterhouse/sleep-and-his-half-brother-death-1874\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSleep and his Half-brother Death is a painting by John William Waterhouse completed in 1874.\r Waterhouse's first Royal Academy exhibit (submitted from his father's house at 1 Scarsdale Villas), it was painted after both his younger brothers died of tuberculosis.\r The painting itself is a reference to the Greek gods Hypnos (sleep) and Thanatos (death) who, in the Greek mythology, were brothers.

It is currently housed at Tate Britain.\r A very daring composition, this is one of Waterhouse's most unusual, and consequently most striking, oil paintings. The corpse is dramatically foreshortened, and the snow contrasts with Eulalia\u2019s naked flesh \u2013 the 12-year-old girl seems singularly out of place for a Waterhouse picture. His choice of configuration \u2013 situating the corpse across the front and leaving so much of the central canvas unoccupied \u2013 was risky but it worked: by placing all the background figures in the distance, he concentrated the viewer's gaze on the naked body. The nudity was also groundbreaking for Waterhouse \u2013 and something that could have laid him open to criticism \u2013 but his sensitive handling of the subject, the youth of the saint, and the historical context of the painting allowed him to escape the critics' pen. The eye is also led to the murdered girl by the angle of the Roman guard's spear, pointing to the ropes that had bound her to the stake.\r According to legend, the snow was believed to have been sent by God as a shroud to cover the saint's nakedness; and the dove, seen flying upwards near the crowd of mourners, indicative of Eulalia's soul flying up to Heaven, was said to have flown out of her mouth.\n", "\nArtist: John William Waterhouse\nArtwork Name: The Magic Circle\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-william-waterhouse/the-magic-circle-1886\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Magic Circle is an oil painting in the Pre-Raphaelite style, created in 1886 by John William Waterhouse. The painting depicts a witch or sorceress drawing a fiery magic circle on the earth to create a ritual space.\r The Magic Circle was shown at the Royal Academy in 1886, and, after Consulting the Oracle and St. Eulalia, was Waterhouse's third exhibit with a supernatural theme in as many years. The painting was well received at its exhibition, and was purchased for \u00a3650 the same year by the Tate Gallery, through the Chantrey Bequest. The painting was extremely successful with the critics and public alike.\r In a style typical of Waterhouse, the main character is a lone, female figure, placed centrally on the canvas. The surrounding landscape is hazy, as though it is not quite real, and the background figures are only discernible on close inspection, deliberately ensuring the witch is the only image of importance.\r Waterhouse paid careful attention to the angles employed in this work, balancing the circle the figure is drawing around herself by the use of a triangle \u2013 her straight arm, extended by the straight stick, held out at 25 degrees to her erect body. The witch's power is emphasised by the determined face, by her exclusion of the ravens and frog \u2013 popular symbols representing magic \u2013 and by her command over the smoke pillar. Instead of billowing outwards or being affected by the wind, it remains in a straight line. A live snake ouroboros loops around the woman's neck.\r The Magic Circle is similar in composition to Waterhouse's later picture, Miranda (1916), also a woman associated with magic. The witch wears a similar dress to Miranda and her face can also only be seen in profile. Unlike Frederick Sandys' portrayals of sorceresses, such as his Medea (1868) or Morgan le Fay (1864), Waterhouse chose to make his witch's face intent and intriguing, as opposed to malevolent.\r Miracles, magic and the power of prophecy are common themes in Waterhouse's art. More specifically, the notion of woman as enchantress is one that recurs in images such as Circe Offering the Cup to Ulysees (1891, Oldham Art Gallery) and Hylas and the Nymphs (1896, Manchester City Art Gallery). His oeuvre also includes a number of middle-eastern subjects, in which he drew on the work of contemporary artists such as J.F Lewis (1805\u201376) and Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836\u20131912), rather than on actual experience. This is one of Waterhouse's earlier works, and reflects his fascination with the exotic.\n", "\nArtist: John William Waterhouse\nArtwork Name: The Lady of Shalott\nArtwork Genre: literary painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-william-waterhouse/the-lady-of-shalott-1888\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Lady of Shalott is a painting of 1888 by the English painter John William Waterhouse. It is a representation of the ending of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's 1832 poem of the same name. Waterhouse painted three different versions of this character, in 1888, 1894 and 1915. It is one of his most famous works, which adopted much of the style of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, though Waterhouse was painting several decades after the Brotherhood split up during his early childhood.\r The Lady of Shalott was donated to the public by Sir Henry Tate in 1894, and is usually on display in Tate Britain, London, in room 1840.\r The Lady of Shalott is one of John William Waterhouse's most famous works, an 1888 oil-on-canvas painting of a scene from Tennyson's poem in which the poet describes the plight of a young woman, loosely based on the figure of Elaine of Astolat from medieval Arthurian legend, who yearned with an unrequited love for the knight Sir Lancelot, isolated under an undisclosed curse in a tower near King Arthur's Camelot. Waterhouse painted three different versions of this character, in 1888, 1894 and 1915.\r The painting has the precisely painted detail and bright colours associated with the Pre-Raphaelites. The Lady of Shalott pictures the Lady, who is the main character in Tennyson's poem, also titled The Lady of Shalott (1842), who is facing her destiny. The Lady has made her way to this small canoe with a few of her belongings. She had been confined to her quarters, not allowed to go outside or even look outdoors. \"A curse is on her if she stay\", wrote Tennyson. In the poem, a curse had been put on the Lady, but she defies the rules of the curse to see if she could live outside of her confinement. This is the moment that is pictured in Waterhouse's painting, as the Lady is leaving to face her destiny. She is pictured sitting on a tapestry, which showcases Waterhouse\u2019s strong attention to detail.\r Initially it simply appears to be a painting of a woman in a canoe-like boat, but the painting is filled with significant detail that amplifies the meaning. The Lady has a lantern at the front of her boat; in the poem by Tennyson and reflected in Waterhouse's image it will soon be dark. Also, with a closer look, we can see a crucifix positioned near the front of the bow, and the Lady is gazing right over it. Next to the crucifix are three candles. Candles were a representation of life \u2013 two of the candles are already blown out, signifying that her death is soon to come. Aside from the metaphoric details, this painting is valued for Waterhouse's realistic painting abilities. Her dress is stark white against the much darker hues of the background. Waterhouse's close attention to detail and colour, accentuation of the beauty of nature, realist quality, and his interpretation of a vulnerable, yearning woman are further representative of his artistic skill.\r The Lady of Shalott was donated to the public by Sir Henry Tate in 1894.\n", "\nArtist: John William Waterhouse\nArtwork Name: Circe Offering the Cup to Ulysses\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-william-waterhouse/circe-offering-the-cup-to-ulysses-1891\n\nWikipedia Article:\nCirce Offering the Cup to Ulysses is an oil painting in the Pre-Raphaelite style by John William Waterhouse that was created in 1891.\r The painting depicts a scene from the Odyssey where the sorceress Circe offers Odysseus (called Ulysses by the Romans) a cup containing a potion with which she seeks to bring him under her spell as she has his crew.

The painting depicts a moment from the Greek and Roman legend of the tragic youth Hylas, based on accounts by Ovid and other ancient writers, in which the enraptured Hylas is abducted by Naiads (female water nymphs) while seeking drinking water. The painting has been interpreted as a metaphor for dangerous female sexuality, and warning against nymphomania.\r Hylas was the son of King Theiodamas of the Dryopians. After Hercules killed Hylas's father, Hylas became a companion of Hercules and later his lover. They both became Argonauts, accompanying Jason in his quest on his ship Argo in seeking the Golden Fleece. During the journey, Hylas was sent to find fresh water. He found a pond occupied by Naiads, and they lured Hylas into the water and he disappeared.\r The painting measures 98.2 by 163.3 centimetres (38.7\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a064.3\u00a0in). It depicts Hylas, a male youth in classical garb, wearing a blue tunic with a red sash, and bearing a wide-necked water jar. He is bending down beside a pond in a glade of lush green foliage, reaching out towards seven young women, the water nymphs, who are emerging from the pond among the leaves and flowers of Nymphaeaceae (water lilies), including an early depiction of the yellow waterlily, Nuphar lutea). The nymphs are naked, their alabaster skin luminous in the dark but clear water, with yellow and white flowers in their auburn hair. They have very similar physical features, perhaps based on just two models.\r Hylas is being enticed to enter the water, from which he will not return. One of the nymph holds his wrist and elbow, a second plucks at his tunic, and a third holds out some pearls in the palm of her hand. The face of Hylas in profile is shadowed and barely visible, but the faces of the nymphs are clearly visible as they gaze upon him. The scene is depicted from a slightly elevated position, looking down at the water like Hylas, so no sky is visible.\r Some of Waterhouse's preparatory sketches are in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.\r Hylas was a recurrent theme for British artists in the 19th and early 20th centuries, with examples by William Etty (1833) and Henrietta Rae (1910), and an earlier example by Waterhouse himself (1893). Waterhouse also painted other tragic youths from Greek legend, such as Narcissus (1903) (at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool)A poem \"Hercules and Hylas\" was published by Francis Burdett Thomas Coutts-Nevill in 1896.\r The painting was acquired from the artist by the Manchester Art Gallery in 1896.

He painted over 200 works, mainly in the genres of classical mythology, and of historical or literary subjects. One of his common themes is the femme fatale, the woman who ensnares a man.\r Echo and Narcissus is in the genre of classical mythology. In Ovid's version of the myth, Narcissus was the son of the river god Cephissus and the nymph Liriope. His parents were told that he would live to an old age if he did not look at himself. He rejected all the nymphs and women who fell in love with him. One of these was the nymph Echo, who was so upset by her rejection that she withdrew from life and wasted away until all that was left was a whisper.

The painting was commissioned by the War Artists' Advisory Committee (WAAC), and is now part of the Imperial War Museum's art collection. The painting brought instant fame to Loftus, and has been likened to the American figure of \"Rosie the Riveter\".\r The War Artists' Advisory Committee (WAAC) commissioned the British painter Laura Knight to paint a portrait to bolster female recruitment to the ordnance factories as the Ministry of Supply were concerned at the level of disaffection and absenteeism among women in the factories. The resulting painting, made in the autumn of 1942, is one of the largest oil paintings in the entire WAAC collection and the largest single figure portrait it acquired throughout the war. It was painted in the Royal Ordnance Factory in Newport, South Wales, and shows a young woman, Ruby Loftus, performing a highly skilled piece of work on an industrial lathe. The component being worked is the breech ring of a double-barrelled, anti-aircraft gun designed to fire twenty rounds per minute. Any lack of precision in forming the breech ring could result in the gun being destroyed when fired. In peace-time this task would only be performed by a man with eight or nine years' experience but the 21-year-old Loftus mastered the technique after only a year or two of training.\r Knight was initially offered 75 guineas for the commission, which she regarded as quite low for the effort and trouble involved in creating the work, and asked that the fee be raised to \"100 guineas and expenses...which is infinitely lower than I should ask for any other work than that connected with the war\". Her request was granted. Knight stayed in Newport to paint the picture, and over four weeks painted Loftus at work on her lathe.\r The painting was first shown on 30 April 1943 at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. The next day it was reproduced in eight British newspapers. A British Paramount News newsreel film, shot two days before the painting's unveiling and featuring the painting, Knight and Loftus, was shown in Britain's cinemas. Loftus was suddenly famous; she was interviewed on the BBC and her picture appeared in newspapers all over Britain. The painting was also reproduced in a poster version by WAAC.\r The success of the painting led to further industrial commissions for Knight throughout the 1940s. In 1945 she painted Switch Works at Ellison Switchgear in Birmingham. This was followed by paintings of operations at the Dow Mac concrete railway-sleeper works and at the Skefko ball bearing factory.\r Loftus married Lance Corporal John Green in September 1943, and took her husband's surname. After the war, she was offered an opportunity to take an engineering course, but decided against it and emigrated to Canada with her husband, eventually settling in Winfield, British Columbia. Loftus was later diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. In British Columbia, she worked as an apple packer, in a post office, and as a correspondent for a local newspaper. Loftus travelled to London to see her portrait in the Imperial War Museum in May 1962, where she was accompanied by Laura Knight. Loftus's husband died in 2003, and she died in June 2004 at the age of 83.\n", "\nArtist: Francis Bacon\nArtwork Name: Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion\nArtwork Genre: figurative\nArtwork Media: board,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/three-studies-for-figures-at-the-base-of-a-crucifixion-1944\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion is a 1944 triptych painted by the Irish-born British artist Francis Bacon. The canvasses are based on the Eumenides\u2014or Furies\u2014of Aeschylus's Oresteia, and depict three writhing anthropomorphic creatures set against a flat burnt orange background. It was executed in oil paint and pastel on Sundeala fibre board and completed within two weeks. The triptych summarises themes explored in Bacon's previous work, including his examination of Picasso's biomorphs and his interpretations of the Crucifixion and the Greek Furies. Bacon did not realise his original intention to paint a large crucifixion scene and place the figures at the foot of the cross.  The Three Studies are generally considered Bacon's first mature piece; he regarded his works before the triptych as irrelevant, and throughout his life tried to suppress their appearance on the art market. When the painting was first exhibited in 1945 it caused a sensation and established him as one of the foremost post-war painters. Remarking on the cultural significance of Three Studies, the critic John Russell observed in 1971 that \"there was painting in England before the Three Studies, and painting after them, and no one\u00a0... can confuse the two\".  As an artist, Francis Bacon was a late starter. He painted sporadically and without commitment during the late 1920s and early 1930s, when he worked as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs. He later admitted that his career was delayed because he had spent so long looking for a subject that would sustain his interest. He began to paint images based on the Crucifixion in 1933, when his then-patron Eric Hall commissioned a series of three paintings based on the subject. These abstract figurations contain formal elements typical of their time, including diaphanous forms, flat backgrounds, and surrealist props such as flowers and umbrellas. The art critic Wieland Schmied noted that while the early works are \"aesthetically pleasing\", they lack \"a sense of urgency or inner necessity; they are beautiful, but lifeless\". The sentiment is echoed by Hugh Davies, who wrote that Bacon's 1933 paintings \"suggest an artist concentrating more on formal than on expressive concerns\". Bacon admitted that his early works were not successful; they were merely decorative and lacking in substance. He was often harshly self-critical during this period, and would abandon or destroy canvasses before they were completed. He abandoned the Crucifixion theme, then largely withdrew from painting in frustration, instead immersing himself in love affairs, drinking and gambling.  When he returned to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career\u2014three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, \"I was in a bad mood of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing. I think perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer.\" The painting was executed in a ground-floor flat at 7 Cromwell Place, South Kensington in London. A large back room in the building had been converted into a billiard room by its previous occupant, artist John Everett Millais. It was Bacon's studio by day; at night, abetted by Eric Hall and Bacon's childhood nanny Jessie Lightfoot, it functioned as an illicit casino.\n", "\nArtist: Francis Bacon\nArtwork Name: Head IV\nArtwork Genre: figurative\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/head-iv-1949\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  Head VI is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Irish-born figurative artist Francis Bacon, the last of six panels making up his \"1949 Head\" series. It shows a bust view of a single figure, modeled on Diego Vel\u00e1zquez's Portrait of Innocent X. Bacon applies forceful, expressive brush strokes, and places the figure within a glass cage structure, behind curtain-like drapery. This gives the effect of a man trapped and suffocated by his surroundings, screaming into an airless void.  Head VI was the first of Bacon's paintings to reference Vel\u00e1zquez, whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of \"screaming popes\", a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving individual works. Head VI contains many motifs that were to reappear in Bacon's work. The hanging object, which may be a light switch or curtain tassel, can be found even in his late paintings. The geometric cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985\u201386 masterpiece Study for a Self-Portrait\u2014Triptych.  Head VI was first exhibited in November 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London, in a showing organised by one of the artist's early champions, Erica Brausen. At the time, Bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist, best known for his 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, which made him the enfant terrible of British art. Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics; John Russell, later Bacon's biographer, at the time dismissed it as a cross between \"an alligator shorn of its jaws and an accountant in pince-nez who has come to a bad end\". In 1989 Lawrence Gowing wrote that the \"shock of the picture, when it was seen with a whole series of heads\u00a0... was indescribable. It was everything unpardonable. The paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche and iconoclasm was indeed one of Bacon's most original strokes.\" Art critic and curator David Sylvester described it as a seminal piece from Bacon's unusually productive 1949\u201350 period, and one of Bacon's finest popes.  Bacon's output is characterised by sequences of images. He told Sylvester that his imagination was stimulated by sequences and that \"images breed other images in me\". His series were not always planned or painted in sequence; sometimes paintings are grouped for convenience but vary in execution and tone. The idea for the head series came after he returned penniless, late in 1948, from a stay in Tangier. In the previous three years he had been unable to find a voice; the last surviving canvas from this period is his Painting (1946). Although he continued to paint, he was a ruthless self-critic, given to slashing canvases with blades, and no works survive from between 1947 and the winter of 1948. Gallerist Erica Brausen offered Bacon the opportunity of a solo show for the opening of her new Hanover Gallery. He agreed, but had nothing in reserve to hang. In following years, Brausen became perhaps the most important of Bacon's early champions; she arranged this showing\u2014his debut solo exhibition\u2014publicised him widely and organised viewings for international buyers.\n", "\nArtist: Francis Bacon\nArtwork Name: Three Figures in a Room\nArtwork Genre: figurative\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/three-figures-in-a-room-1964\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThree Figures in a Room is a 1964 oil-on-canvas triptych painting by British artist Francis Bacon. Each panel measures 198\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0147 centimetres (78\u00a0\u00d7\u00a058\u00a0in) and shows a separate view of his lover George Dyer, whom Bacon first met in 1963. It is the first of Bacon's works to feature Dyer, a model to whom he returned to repeatedly in his paintings. The work has been described as Bacon's first secular triptych.\r Bacon had been painting triptychs since his in 1944 break-through Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion. Three Figures continues the theme of Bacon studying a single subject from different angles. Although painted on three separate canvases, each image occupies the same space, marked by a brown elliptical floor and yellowish walls which continue across the panels. The presence of a single model three times in the same space defies narrative explanation.\r Dyer is depicted in three different positions, all twisted and contorted. Bacon uses large and vigorous brushstrokes to create distinctive splashes of colour. In the left panel, a naked Dyer sits on a toilet facing away from the viewer; he rests on a massive black bed or chair in the centre panel; and he is sitting contorted on a pedestal chair in the right panel. The creased back of the left figure may be inspired by Edgar Degas's drawing After the Bath, Woman drying herself, and also possibly by the Belvedere Torso. Art critic David Sylvester has suggested that the centre and right figures may be inspired by Michelangelo's sculptures in the Medici Chapel, and draws parallels with the three figures in Henri Matisse's Bathers with a Turtle.\r The work was bought by the French state in 1968 and has been part of the collection of the Centre Georges Pompidou since 1976.\n", "\nArtist: Francis Bacon\nArtwork Name: Three Studies of Lucian Freud\nArtwork Genre: sketch and study\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/three-studies-of-lucian-freud-1969\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThree Studies of Lucian Freud is a 1969 oil-on-canvas triptych by the Irish-born British painter Francis Bacon, depicting artist Lucian Freud. It was sold in November 2013 for US$142.4 million, which at the time was the highest price attained at auction for a work of art when not factoring in inflation. That record was surpassed in May 2015 by Version O of Picasso's Les Femmes d'Alger series.\r Bacon and Freud were friends but artistic rivals. Introduced in 1945 by artist Graham Sutherland, they swiftly became close friends who met frequently. The two artists painted each other several times, starting in 1951, when Freud first sat for Bacon. Two full-length triptychs of Freud by Bacon resulted. Three Studies of Lucian Freud is the later of the two; the first one, created in 1966, has not been seen since 1992. They form part of a series of large triptych portraits of Bacon's friends painted in the 1960s; other subjects include Isabel Rawsthorne, Muriel Belcher and his partner George Dyer. Bacon and Freud's friendship ended after an argument in the mid-1970s.\r All three panels, in Bacon's typical abstract, distorted, isolated style, show Freud sitting on a cane-bottomed wooden chair within a cage, on a curved mottled-brown surface with a solid orange background. Behind each figure is a headboard of a bed, originating in a set of photographs of Freud by John Deakin which Bacon used as a reference. Michael Peppiatt writes \"Trapped here in a series of Baconian cages, a contorted Freud hovers from panel to panel like a coiled spring about to shoot out of the flat, airless picture plane.\" The central panel portrays the figure face on, in a pose similar to that Bacon used for George Dyer, his lover. Brett Gorvy of Christie's considers the work to represent \"a marriage of the incredibly important people in Bacon's life.\" The three canvases of the triptych are the same size and are each individually framed. The colouring is brighter than is typical of Bacon's works.\r Francis Outred of Christie's describes the 1969 triptych as \"a true masterpiece\" and \"an undeniable icon of 20th Century art\" which \"marks Bacon and Freud's relationship, paying tribute to the creative and emotional kinship between the two artists.\" Art historian Ben Street describes the work as \"not an A-grade Bacon.\" It was among Bacon's favourites of his works.\r The triptych was painted in 1969 at the Royal College of Art in London, where Bacon had a large enough studio to work on three adjacent canvases simultaneously. It was first exhibited in 1970 at the Galleria d'Arte Galatea in Turin, and then was included in a retrospective at the Grand Palais in Paris and the Kunsthalle D\u00fcsseldorf in 1971\u201372. The three panels of the triptych were sold separately in the mid-1970s. Bacon was unhappy that the panels had been split up, writing on a photograph of the left-hand panel that it was \"meaningless unless it is united with the other two panels.\" The panels were held by different collectors until the late 1980s, when one of the original purchasers, a collector from Rome named in some sources as Francesco De Simone Niquesa, reassembled the work. The reassembled triptych was exhibited in the US, at the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut in 1999, but the entire work was not exhibited in the UK until October 2013.\n", "\nArtist: Francis Bacon\nArtwork Name: Triptych, May\u2013June 1973\nArtwork Genre: figurative\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/triptych-may-june-1973\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  Triptych, May\u2013June 1973 is a triptych completed in 1973 by the Irish-born artist Francis Bacon (1909\u20131992).

The triptych is a portrait of the moments before Dyer's death from an overdose of pills in their hotel room. Bacon was haunted and preoccupied by Dyer's loss for the remaining years of his life and painted many works based on both the actual suicide and the events of its aftermath. He admitted to friends that he never fully recovered, describing the 1973 triptych as an exorcism of his feelings of loss and guilt.

The work was painted in the fall of 1912, possibly on the Mississagi River. It depicts an area desolate and damaged due to flooding via damming. It was purchased by the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto in 1937 and has remained in the collection ever since. It was produced near the beginning of Thomson's short art career, just as he was beginning a transition from commercial art into full-time painting.  In 1912 after Thomson's initial experience of visiting Algonquin Park, he and his colleague William Broadhead went on a two-month expedition up the Spanish River and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today Mississagi Provincial Park). Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his original style of painting began to be apparent around this time. Much of his artwork from this trip, mainly oil sketches and photographs, has been lost due to two canoe spills experienced during the trip, the first spill being on Green Lake in a rain squall and the second in a series of rapids.  Thomson's art director while at Grip Ltd., Albert Robson, identified Drowned Land as being painted on the Mississagi Forest Reserve canoe trip. Art historian David Silcox has suggested that it was perhaps painted on Lake Scugog or near Owen Sound. It was painted with oil on paper, which was further embossed with canvas texture, all mounted on plywood. A similar support was used for View Over a Lake: Shore with Houses.  The painting came right as Thomson was transitioning from commercial art into fine art and indicates his innate talent. It is similar to a sketch from the previous year, Near Owen Sound, in terms of colour, drawing and texture. On display is a \"camera-like precision\" and his incredible attention to detail in capturing scenes. Indeed, David Silcox has speculated that Drowned Land as well as other paintings may have been completed with a photograph as a memory aid given their \"uncanny precision.\" The painting is especially notable for its skill of composition and precision, especially when compared with some of Thomson's other work from this period, such as The Canoe and Old Lumber Dam, Algonquin Park. These early sketches show how he had not yet established his own form of expression, being particularly dark and dreary compared to his later work. The subject of desolation was uncommon for the time, having not been seen in Canadian painting since the works of topographers in the early-nineteenth century.  The painting, like others from this period, depicts ideal fishing territory that Thomson likely would have enjoyed. Many of his paintings were overt in their depictions of the lumber industry, including dams, pointers, alligators and drives, the presence of industry being on his mind from early on. Drowned Land however is more subtle as it does not directly display any logging equipment. Instead, it presents the damage caused by logging operations and flooding due to damming. A hopeful recovering growth is apparent in the distance behind the skeleton of trees in the foreground.\n", "\nArtist: Tom Thomson\nArtwork Name: The Jack Pine\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/the-jack-pine-1917\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Jack Pine is a well-known oil painting by Canadian artist Tom Thomson. A representation of the most broadly distributed pine species in Canada, it is considered an iconic image of the country's landscape, and is one of the country's most widely recognized and reproduced artworks.\r The painting was completed in 1917, the year of Thomson's death. It is a roughly square canvas that measures 127.9\u00a0\u00d7 139.8 cm. It has been in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa since 1918.\r Beginning in 1913, Thomson annually stayed in Algonquin Park from the spring until the autumn, often working as a guide while also fishing and painting for his own pleasure. In 1916, he also worked in the Park as a fire ranger. It was there, on Grand Lake with the hills near Carcajou Bay in the background, that Thomson made the oil sketch in 1916 that he would use for the final painting in 1917. There are numerous other paintings by Thomson with compositions similar to that of The Jack Pine: in fact, the majority of Thomson's canvasses depict the far side of a shore. These include Northern Lake (1912\u201313), his first; Pine Island, Georgian Bay (1914\u201316; pictured); and more famously, The West Wind (1917), another painting of iconic status.\r The painting depicts a jack pine as a decorative and abstracted pattern, its shapes boldly simplified against the sunset. This stylization demonstrates Thomson's command of decorative effects, developed during his years as a graphic designer, and with the strong colour and value contrasts, creates the picture's symbolic resonance. The pine, its branches bowed and placed to the right of centre, extends nearly the full length of the canvas, and is cropped at the top. It rises from a rocky foreground; the hardy jack pine often takes root on shores hostile to other trees, its sparsely leaved branches forming eccentric shapes. It is silhouetted against water and sky, with the canvas bisected by the far shore.\r The final canvas differs markedly from Thomson's spring 1916 sketch. He made the tree appear larger by lowering the hills on the far side of the lake. The weather had been stormy when Thomson made the sketch and the dark, rolling clouds were echoed in the heavy, swirling brushwork of the sky and the slate grey lake. In the final painting, Thomson has swapped the storm clouds for a clear twilight sky. The sky and lake are now highly stylized, painted in long horizontal brushstrokes that show, along with its nearly square format, the influence of Thomson's colleague Lawren Harris.\r Thomson began with a vermilion red undertone, which he likely chose to avoid mixing the complementary colours red and green. The red was allowed to show through in parts of the tree, foreground landscape, and hills, making the colour \"[seem] to vibrate\".\r Yet the focal point of the painting is not in the foreground, but at the distant shore\u2014the patch of snow just below the centre of the canvas. Dennis Reid, who wrote a booklet on the painting for the National Gallery, points out an almost circular shape made by the foreground elements that encompass the focal point. The circle is formed from the large curving branches of the tree, the sloping left foreground, and the smaller tree at right. Reid writes that this near-circle \"exists in space more like a ball, and as we peer through that ball to the opposite shore, for an instant we're inside our eye.\"\n", "\nArtist: Tom Thomson\nArtwork Name: The West Wind\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/the-west-wind-1917\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe West Wind is a painting by Canadian artist Tom Thomson. An iconic image, the pine at its centre has been described as growing \"in the national ethos as our one and only tree in a country of trees\". It was the artist's final painting, and according to some art historians was unfinished at the time of his sudden death by drowning in 1917.\r Thomson based The West Wind on an earlier, slightly different sketch he produced in 1916 while working as a park ranger in Algonquin Park. In the finished canvas Thomson moved the pine further to the right, replaced a less defined foreground plane with strongly patterned rock shapes, and removed a dead tree limb from the ground. The location of the subject is uncertain; Thomson's friend Winifred Trainor believed the site represented was Cedar Lake, though Grand Lake, Algonquin Park has also been proposed as the setting. Some locals believe the location to be on Kawawaymog Lake.\r As in his iconic The Jack Pine, Thomson began the painting with an undercoat of vermilion that he allowed to show through in various places to contrast with the greens, to lend the work a feeling of \"vibration\" and movement. The pine dominates the composition without obscuring the view into the distance, and is successful as both specific representation and abstract design.\r Though not imposing in scale, it is a graceful arabesque decoration, \"a magnified bonsai\". Thomson's background in design lent his composition an art-nouveau sensibility, for example, \"in the way a single tree stands silhouetted against water or the sky like a symbol of romantic solitude\". An earlier reviewer noticed the same effect in it and The Jack Pine: \"[these] two best-known canvases... are essentially Art Nouveau designs in the flat, the principal motif in each case being a tree drawn in great sinuous curves... Such pictures, are, however, saved from complete stylization by the use of uncompromisingly native subject-matter and of Canadian colours, the glowing colours of autumn.\"\r According to Trainor, Thomson was not satisfied with the picture, fearing that the flat abstract shapes of the foreground rocks and trees were inconsistent with the atmospheric conception of the background. However, for Thomson's colleague Arthur Lismer, the trees in The West Wind were symbolic of the national character, models of resolve against the elements. Thomson biographer and curator Joan Murray, while initially disliking the painting, wrote that it \"is a powerful canvas; resonating with its message of weather and wind, it expressed the divine as some of us imagine it in Canada. This is the sort of tree that would stand at the gates of heaven to open the doors of the kingdom.\"\r The Canadian Club of Toronto donated The West Wind to the recently opened Art Gallery of Toronto (now the Art Gallery of Ontario). Librarian George Locke, a club member, announced the donation in a speech, praising Thomson's accomplishments: \"Thomson needs no tablet to commemorate his achievements ... He has left us work that expresses our national life \u2013 the forces of the great natural surroundings of this young land.\"\n", "\nArtist: Joan Miro\nArtwork Name: Naked Woman Climbing a Staircase\nArtwork Genre: nude painting (nu)\nArtwork Media: paper,pencil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro/naked-woman-climbing-a-staircase-1937\n\nWikipedia Article:\nNaked Woman Climbing a Staircase (originally in French Femme nue montant l'escalier) is a drawing done with pencil and charcoal on card made by Joan Mir\u00f3 in 1937. It is part of the permanent collection of the Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3 in Barcelona.\r Mir\u00f3 created Naked Woman Climbing a Staircase during the Spanish Civil War. He was living in Paris when he started to attend life drawing classes at the school of the Grande Chaumiere. Mir\u00f3 returned to constructing the human figure to represent the drama that was then taking place in Catalonia. This feeling can be made out in the shapes used to draw this tortured nude woman climbing a staircase. Other works of this period include Still Life with Old Shoe and Aidez l'Espagne.\r According to the Joan Mir\u00f3 Foundation, \"Mir\u00f3's despondency brought about by the moral tragedy of the war can be seen in the violent metamorphosis of the figure, in her heavy limbs and in the effort involved in climbing.\" At the top right is a kind of window or box where light rays can be seen entering the room. The woman is using her right arm to try to grab a ladder \u2013 this was a symbol that Mir\u00f3 used in several of his works to represent evasion or escape. The external genitals of the woman are similar to those of the woman in Man and Woman in Front of a Pile of Excrement as they are exaggerated in size. This work is said to be related to Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, made by Marcel Duchamp, although here the woman is ascending. The distortion and effort of the figure are interpreted as mirroring the Spanish Civil War. Interestingly Duchamp's painting was not wholly original; it alluded to the earlier photographs by Eadweard Muybridge which were amongst the first to record animal locomotion. Mir\u00f3 first saw this work by Duchamp in 1912, during the Cubist art exhibition held at the Dalmau Gallery (Galeries Dalmau) in Barcelona.\r Muybridge's idea of a woman on a staircase caught the imagination of not only Duchamp and Mir\u00f3 but also Mir\u00f3's contemporary Salvador Dal\u00ed who created a homage to Duchamp's painting. His model was also shown ascending the stairs like Mir\u00f3's subject.\r The exhibition L'escala de l'evasi\u00f3 that opened in October 2011 was supported by access to Wikipedia using QRpedia codes that allowed access to visitors in Catalan, English and several other languages.\n", "\nArtist: Joan Miro\nArtwork Name: Woman and Bird\nArtwork Genre: sculpture\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro/woman-and-bird-1983\n\nWikipedia Article:\nDona i Ocell ([\u02c8d\u0254.n\u0259 i u\u02c8se\u028e], \"Woman and Bird\") is a 22-metre high sculpture by Joan Mir\u00f3 located in the Parc Joan Mir\u00f3 in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The sculpture was covered in tiles by the artist's collaborator Joan Gardy Artigas. The sculpture is part of an artwork trilogy commissioned from Mir\u00f3 to welcome visitors to Barcelona.\r The concrete structure was formally opened in 1982 or 1983 (sources vary) and it was one of Joan Mir\u00f3's last large sculptures which he constructed with the help of his friend and collaborator Joan Gardy Artigas. Mir\u00f3 was not able to attend the opening as he was too ill and he died less than a year later.\r It was Mir\u00f3's design but Artigas was responsible for adding the tiles as he had done for Mir\u00f3's earlier mural in Ludwigshafen, Germany. Dona i Ocell was part a publicly commissioned trilogy that was intended to welcome visitors to Barcelona as they arrived by the sea, from the air or in this case by land. Car passengers that arrive in Barcelona can see the strong colours of the tiles which are indicative of Mir\u00f3's style. This work was the last of the three sculptures that welcomed Barcelona's tourists. The first was at the airport and it was commissioned in 1968. The intermediate work was a large mosaic in La Rambla in Barcelona.\r The work uses some of Mir\u00f3's recurring themes of women and birds. In Catalan the word for a \"bird\" (ocell) can be used as slang for penis. This might be reflected in the phallic shape of the main form which has a hole through the glans. The sculpture is decorated in primary colours and it has a vulva shaped split down the side of the shaft which is lined with blackish tiles. The idea for the sculpture is not new and examples of placing vulva on a model penis and a hole in the glans have been found on Roman sculpture from the second or third century.\r The park where the sculpture is installed covers four blocks of the Barcelona road grid near the Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya. The park is a popular area to relax.

Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century and one of the best in the Spanish language, he was awarded the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature. He pursued a self-directed education that resulted in his leaving law school for a career in journalism. From early on, he showed no inhibitions in his criticism of Colombian and foreign politics. In 1958, he married Mercedes Barcha; they had two sons, Rodrigo and Gonzalo.\r Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez started as a journalist, and wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best known for his novels, such as One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), The Autumn of the Patriarch (1975), and Love in the Time of Cholera (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style known as magic realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in the fictional village of Macondo (mainly inspired by his birthplace, Aracataca), and most of them explore the theme of solitude.\r Upon Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s death in April 2014, Juan Manuel Santos, the President of Colombia, called him \"the greatest Colombian who ever lived.\"\r Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was born on 6 March 1927 in Aracataca, Colombia, to Gabriel Eligio Garc\u00eda and Luisa Santiaga M\u00e1rquez Iguar\u00e1n. Soon after Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was born, his father became a pharmacist and moved, with his wife, to Barranquilla, leaving young Gabriel in Aracataca. He was raised by his maternal grandparents, Do\u00f1a Tranquilina Iguar\u00e1n and Colonel Nicol\u00e1s Ricardo M\u00e1rquez Mej\u00eda. In December 1936, his father took him and his brother to Sinc\u00e9, while in March 1937, his grandfather died; the family then moved first (back) to Barranquilla and then on to Sucre, where his father started up a pharmacy.\r When his parents fell in love, their relationship met with resistance from Luisa Santiaga M\u00e1rquez's father, the Colonel. Gabriel Eligio Garc\u00eda was not the man the Colonel had envisioned winning the heart of his daughter: he (Gabriel Eligio) was a Conservative, and had the reputation of being a womanizer. Gabriel Eligio wooed Luisa with violin serenades, love poems, countless letters, and even telephone messages after her father sent her away with the intention of separating the young couple. Her parents tried everything to get rid of the man, but he kept coming back, and it was obvious their daughter was committed to him. Her family finally capitulated and gave her permission to marry him (The tragicomic story of their courtship would later be adapted and recast as Love in the Time of Cholera.)\r Since Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's parents were more or less strangers to him for the first few years of his life, his grandparents influenced his early development very strongly. His grandfather, whom he called \"Papalelo\", was a Liberal veteran of the Thousand Days War. The Colonel was considered a hero by Colombian Liberals and was highly respected. He was well known for his refusal to remain silent about the banana massacres that took place the year after Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was born. The Colonel, whom Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez described as his \"umbilical cord with history and reality,\" was also an excellent storyteller. He taught Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez lessons from the dictionary, took him to the circus each year, and was the first to introduce his grandson to ice\u2014a \"miracle\" found at the United Fruit Company store. He would also occasionally tell his young grandson \"You can't imagine how much a dead man weighs\", reminding him that there was no greater burden than to have killed a man, a lesson that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez would later integrate into his novels.\n", "\nArtist: Alejandro Cabeza\nArtwork Name: Marcos Ana\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/alejandro-cabeza/cesar-vallejo-mendoza\n\nWikipedia Article:\nFernando Macarro Castillo (20 January 1920 in Alconada \u2013 24 November 2016 in Madrid), better known by his pseudonym Marcos Ana, was a Spanish poet and is considered by numerous sources Spain's longest serving political prisoner.

During the civil war, he served as a medical aid in the Republican army. After the war he was imprisoned for six years. After being released he wrote Story of a Stairway in 1949. This work presented a graphic picture of Spain after the Civil War and won the Lope de Vega Prize, establishing Vallejo as one of the foremost authors in Spain. While other authors left Spain to escape Franco's censorship, Vallejo stayed in Spain and used symbolism to criticize the government. In 1971, he was elected to the Royal Spanish Academy. In 1994 he was awarded the Gold Medal of Merit in Fine Arts and the Gold Medal of the Society of Authors of Spain.\r A common theme in his work is Spain's problems during and after Franco.

Completed during Xu's stay in Singapore, the painting was exhibited numerous times before its disappearance from public view in 1954. It re-emerged in 2007 and was sold for HK$72 million (US$9.2 million) in an auction on 7 April 2007 in Hong Kong, then setting a record for the highest price ever paid for a Chinese painting at an auction.\r In October 1939, during his stay in Singapore, Xu Beihong was inspired by a street drama performance titled Put Down Your Whip by actress Wang Ying, a friend of the artist. Written by Chen Liting based on a play by Tian Han, the drama depicts a girl and her father who escaped from the Japanese-occupied Northeast China and performed in the streets for a living. They sang about the hardship under the Japanese occupation and inspired their listeners to support the anti-Japanese war. Deeply moved by the drama, Xu spent ten days painting a life-size portrait of Wang with her audience in the background.

This tribute to human senses is made using repouss\u00e9 and chasing technique, and is composed of welded sheets of metal.  Inspired by human senses and crossmodal perception, Kristek executed this sculpture in one of his typical techniques \u2013 from welded sheets of metal that he formed using repouss\u00e9 and chasing technique.   The piece depicts five human senses that conjoin in a face-like shape and resemble a growing plant. The hand is open. Kristek\u2019s artistic life was permeated by experiments with perception. He meant some of his performances, e. g. Promenade with a Neurotic Fox (1975), as studies of perception and behaviour of crowd. Later, Kristek\u2019s ideas evolved in his theory that various types of stimuli entangle and excite a holographic image in the mind of the spectator. He called it  holographic perception.   The sculptural piece was commissioned by Beatrix und Erich Matthees (the Lechstadt Hausbau company) and donated to the Neues Stadtmuseum.  In November 1992, the sculpture was inaugurated in the museum\u2019s garden as an introduction to Kristek\u2019s solo retrospective exhibition in the Neues Stadtmuseum starting on 12 December.

Kristek started it in 2007 to protest against the addictions to new technologies. He asked the audience to give up their mobile phones and use them to create an assemblage.   The first action was held in the city of Znojmo. The spectators sewed the mobile phones directly on to the artist wearing a jacket with a train (the jacket then became the basis for new assemblage).   The second happening took place in public area \u2013 on the pavement of Mariahilfer Stra\u00dfe in Vienna in 2007. Kristek who likes to remove the barriers between art and reality, deliberately got with his action in the way of passers-by to pull them out of their stereotype and to force them adopt an attitude. The artist dipped the balerina\u2019s pointe shoes into the paint and let her dance on a blank canvas. The pointe shoes also became part of the assemblage afterwards. Then he invited school pupils and passers-by to help to create the new assemblage, to paint and sew more mobile phones on to it. Art and life merged in the avant-garde sense.  The assemblage travelled to an exhibition at the Barockschlo\u00df Riegersburg, today Schloss Ruegers (2007). The artist continued to travel with his mission to other states. With each happening interaction the assemblage changed its shape.  In 2008, the happening series continued in the Neues Stadtmuseum, Landsberg am Lech. It was part of the retrospective exhibition of the works by Lubo Kristek titled Third Eye of Distant Communication.  The following happening took place in a Polish city of Sucha Beskidzka  in 2010. According to Kristek, the relationship of contemporary society to the mobile telephone bears the traits of a cult or even a pathological dependency. Therefore he places this \u201cmodern god\u201d on the altar (with the inscription Rest in Peace) and lets a giant triple-breasted angel to drill it through. The participants of the happening actively contribute to the act of sacrificing the mobile phones.  Requiem for Mobile Telephones belongs to Kristek\u2019s critical assemblages as well as Soundproof Aesthetic of Luxuriety (1976) that reveals the traps of consume approach and In the Prematurely Cloned Age of One Planet (2003) that questiones the ethics of current medical science. \n", "\nArtist: Lubo Kristek\nArtwork Name: Kristek House\nArtwork Genre: architecture,sculpture\nArtwork Media: assemblage\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/lubo-kristek/kristek-house-2017\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  Kristek House (Czech: Kristk\u016fv d\u016fm) is a building on the corner of Ti\u0161novsk\u00e1 and Tr\u00e1vn\u00edky Streets in Brno, Czech Republic that was transformed into a monumental assemblage by the Czech sculptor, painter and action artist Lubo Kristek. The house-assemblage is dedicated to the myth of Sisyphus.  The surrealist Lubo Kristek was born in Brno and lived on Ti\u0161novsk\u00e1 Street during his childhood. In 1968, he emigrated to West Germany and made study trips to many other countries. In 2015, after his lifelong journey, he returned to \"his\" street. Kristek's return led him to conceive the idea of filming the story of Sisyphus. In 2015\u20132017, he consequently transformed his own house into a monumental assemblage showing the cycle Sisyphiade or Boulder in Time and into a film set to be able to show various perspectives of this assemblage.  Kristek was inspired by Albert Camus and his Myth of Sisyphus, but even more by the ideas of George Voskovec recorded on the LP Relativn\u011b Vzato. Kristek met Voskovec in the 1970s during his exhibition tour in the USA.   Voskovec concentrates on the thoughts going through Sisyphus's mind during his descent from the top of the hill to its foot to find the boulder again. He is absolutely free in these moments, he has no \"boulder\". Lubo Kristek developed this concept and added the flow of time. Sisyphus circulates on the clock attached to the minute hand.  The clockwork was designed and constructed especially for this purpose by the Elekon company (Vy\u0161kov), a specialist in public clocks. The system provides exact time and incorporates a changeover to winter time.  Another nook of Kristek House is dedicated to a train from Kristek's childhood, the former Brno-Ti\u0161nov railway line (in Czech: Ti\u0161novka). In his mind it never stopped existing, so he felt a need to visualise it with the help of art. The railway line is painted on the fa\u00e7ade and incorporated into one of the artist's important symbols \u2013 the heavenly highway. This symbol can be found already in his painting The Heavenly Highway of Aunt Fr\u00e4nzi (1974) that is today part of the collection of Neues Stadtmuseum in Landsberg am Lech. Two free birds that have just hatched (reminder of ab ovo \u2013 from the beginning, the egg) fly above the highway.   Two golden hands rise from the corner of the house and reach for the heavens. The hands also protect the living tree and together represent the central symbol of the monumental assemblage.  In Kristek's assemblages from the 1960s, for example in Expecting (1969), the existential nature is apparent as well as the concerns about survival of humanity. His works from the 1970s, for example the assemblage Soundproof Aesthetic of Luxuriety (1976), point out to the hidden traps in modern society. In 1980s, Kristek created his assemblages in landscape from found material, often cast out by the sea, as in Barbed Wire of Christ (1983) and Sea Horse (1986). He incorporates waste to his later works, as in assemblage On the Landfill of Ages (1994) and some of his assemblages, as Requiem for Mobile Telephones (2007), originated in happening, in which he ritually destroyed the achievement of modern era \u2013 mobile telephone \u2013 as a protest against the addiction on modern technologies. In the monumental assemblage Kristek House, he incorporates the motifs of house, home and privacy into the work of art and relates to nature. The artist treats the house as a living being that is constantly changing. \n", "\nArtist: Theodore Chasseriau\nArtwork Name: Self-Portrait in a Redingote\nArtwork Genre: portrait,self-portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-chasseriau/self-portrait-in-a-redingote-1835\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSelf-Portrait, or Portrait of the Artist in a Redingote, is an 1835 oil-on-canvas painting by French romantic artist Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau, which was painted when the artist was 16.

The portrait is a frank portrayal of Chass\u00e9riau's unattractive features, much commented upon during his life: Alice Ozy, later his mistress, referred to him as \"the monkey\". By comparison, a self-portrait of 1838, also in the Louvre, appears more idealized.\n", "\nArtist: Theodore Chasseriau\nArtwork Name: The Toilette of Esther\nArtwork Genre: nude painting (nu)\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-chasseriau/the-toilette-of-esther-1841\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Toilette of Esther or Esther Preparing to be Presented to King Ahasuerus, is an 1841 oil-on-canvas painting by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau. The painting depicts a moment from the scriptural Book of Esther, when Esther prepared to meet King Ahasuerus, ruler of Persia, who subsequently took her as his wife. The painting is in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. Vincent Pomar\u00e8de of the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon has described it as \"one of the most famous (paintings) in the Louvre\".\r The subject derives from the Book of Esther (2:8-9, 15), in which King Ahasuerus, having renounced his wife Vashti, seeks a new queen. Esther, a woman of great beauty, finds favor with Hegai, the eunuch responsible for preparing women for presentation to the king. Upon seeing Esther, Ahasuerus chooses her as his wife. She later reveals that she is Jewish, and intercedes with the king in order to spare the lives of the empire's Jews.\r While choosing a biblical theme as a subject, it is likely that Chass\u00e9riau drew upon more recent literary sources for inspiration. The play Esther, produced by Jean Racine in 1689, offers a more chaste version of Esther's seduction, while describing the artifice employed by her rivals for the king's attention. The exoticism of the painting is closer to an 1817 poem by Alfred de Vigny entitled Le Bain d'une dame romaine, which includes the description:\r and is reminiscent also of Les Orientales by Victor Hugo:\r The episode had rarely been painted before. Only two previous versions are known: a 17th-century painting by Aert de Gelder, and an 18th-century work by Jean-Francois de Troy. Given the dearth of pictorial illustrations of the story, Chass\u00e9riau would have looked to paintings of women at their toilette, including depictions of Venus, of which there were more numerous examples.\r Esther is shown seated at the center of the canvas, arms above her head as she arranges her blond coiffure. Preparing to offer herself for the king's approval, she holds a pose that is \"profoundly erotic in its pictorial treatment\". She is nude to the waist except for a necklace and bracelets on her arms; her legs are swathed in white- and rose-colored garments. At the left a servant woman dressed in rich blue brings accessories, and at the right Hegai, clad in bright red, offers a jewel box. Esther acknowledges neither of them, staring out of the picture to the left. Behind them is a landscape of trees and sky.\r Several preparatory studies exist. Two drawings in the Louvre evidence an initially circular composition, a tondo like The Turkish Bath that Chass\u00e9riau's teacher Ingres would paint in 1862. Such experiments underscore Chass\u00e9riau's desire to find original motifs, as he wrote alongside a drawing at the time: \"....Put...the history...of the world in a new way...allowing one to see these beautiful things once again by presenting them in a fresh manner. May 1841. For my painting Esther preparing her toilette\". The lush accessories and overall coloring owe something to Chass\u00e9riau's admiration for Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix.\r Art historians have long noted Chass\u00e9riau's affection for his sisters, and their subconscious influence on the female figures in his art. Perhaps drawing on the recollection of Chass\u00e9riau's mistress Cl\u00e9mence Monnerot, who said \"Ad\u00e8le has superb arms; they appear everywhere\", Jean-Louis Vaudoyer believed that the beauty of the artist's older sister could be found in Esther's \"muscular, almost masculine, arms\".\n", "\nArtist: Theodore Chasseriau\nArtwork Name: The Two Sisters (of the artist)\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-chasseriau/the-two-sisters-1843\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Two Sisters is an 1843 oil painting on canvas by the French romantic artist Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.

It shows a scene from the biblical entombment of Christ, and was probably completed between 1440 and 1455 as a wing panel for a large hinged polyptych altarpiece. The now-lost altarpiece is thought to have contained a central crucifixion scene flanked by four wing panel works half its height \u2013 two on either side \u2013 depicting scenes from the Life of Christ. The smaller panels would have been paired in a format similar to Bouts' 1464\u201367 Altar of the Holy Sacrament. The larger work was probably commissioned for export to Italy, possibly to a Venetian patron whose identity is lost. The Entombment was first recorded in a mid-19th century Milan inventory and has been in the National Gallery, London since its purchase on the gallery's behalf by Charles Lock Eastlake in 1861.\r The painting is an austere but affecting portrayal of sorrow and grief. It shows four female and three male mourners grieving over the body of Christ. They are, from left to right, Nicodemus, Mary Salome, Mary of Clopas, Mary, the mother of Jesus, John the Evangelist, Mary Magdalene and Joseph of Arimathea.\r It is one of the few surviving 15th-century paintings created using glue-size, an extremely fragile medium lacking durability. The Entombment is in relatively poor condition compared to panel paintings of similar age. Its colours are now far duller than when it was painted; they would, however, always have appeared as less intense and brilliant than those of comparable oil or tempera paintings on panel. The painting is covered by accumulated layers of grey dirt and cannot be cleaned without damaging the surface and removing large amounts of pigment as its glue-size medium is water-soluble. A strip at the top has been less affected than the rest because it was protected by a frame.\r The Entombment shows Christ's body, wrapped in a white linen shroud and still wearing a crown of thorns, as it is lowered into a deep stone tomb. He is attended by seven mourners dressed in contemporary clothing. Among the group of mourners standing at Christ's side, the three female figures are shown with downcast eyes while the two men look directly at Christ; these gazes are reversed with the couple kneeling at his feet. The background contains a wide landscape with a winding pathway and a broad river before a more distant vista of trees and hills. Bouts is considered an innovative painter of landscapes, even in his portrait work where they are included as distant views seen through open windows. The vista in The Entombment is regarded as one of his finest, and is typically composed of distant brown and green hills against a blue sky.\r The Pharisee Nicodemus supports Christ as he is lowered, and can be identified by his similarity to Simon the Pharisee in another canvas attributed to Bouts, Christ in the House of Simon. The Virgin wears a white headdress and a dark blue dress with a yellowish mantle, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid to let go of her dead son.

All of the orthogonals in this composition display an understanding of linear perspective. The lines lead to a single vanishing point in the center of the mantelpiece above Christ's head, though outside the room, the small side room has its own vanishing point, and neither it nor the vanishing point of the main room falls on the horizon of the landscape seen through the windows.\r Dieric Bouts was not a native of Leuven. He moved there from Haarlem and his Last Supper was the first Flemish panel painting of its kind. In this central panel, Bouts has introduced the idea of a group portrait around a table, a theme known to council members in Haarlem. Christ is depicted larger than life in the role of a priest performing the consecration of the Eucharistic host from the Catholic Mass. The men around him are shown a half-size smaller, and probably are accurate portraits of prominent members of the confraternity. Bouts was not the only artist traveling between Haarlem and Leuven. While he was working on this triptych, the church was still being built and the architect Antoon I Keldermans was the same man hired by the Haarlem parish.\r Bouts main contribution to Flemish painting was his introduction of everyday details in the main panel such as the houses on the other side of the market square that can be seen through the windows, and the servants dressed in modern clothing beyond the central scene around the table. Although once identified as the artist himself and his two sons, these servants are most likely more portraits of the confraternity's members responsible for commissioning the altarpiece. This painting was copied by Aelbrecht Bouts, who disregarded the architectural elements through the windows, because by that time the church and the town square had changed. Leuven had built a new town hall, for which Dieric also made a large panel as an allegory of justice.\r The work was documented by Leuven archivist Edward van Even in 1870 and lent to his friend James Weale for his 1902 Exhibition of Flemish Primitives in Bruges.\r The Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament has four additional panels, two on each side. Because these were taken to the museums in Berlin and Munich in the 19th century, the reconstruction of the original altarpiece has been difficult. Today it is thought that the panel with Abraham and Melchizedek is above the Passover Feast on the left wing, while the Gathering of the Manna is above Elijiah and the Angel on the right wing. All of these are typological precursors to the Last Supper in the central panel.\r The church has two paintings by Bouts on display, the Last Supper (1464-1468) and the Martyrdom of St Erasmus (1465). The Nazis seized The Last Supper in 1942. Panels from the painting had been sold legitimately to German museums in the 1800s, and Germany was forced to return all the panels as part of the required reparations of the Versailles Treaty after World War\u00a0I. The chancel and ambulatory were turned into a museum in 1998, where visitors can view a collection of sculptures, paintings and metalwork.\n", "\nArtist: Hieronymus Bosch\nArtwork Name: The Concert in the Egg\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/the-concert-in-the-egg-1480\n\nWikipedia Article:\nConcert in the Egg is a painting formerly considered to be a copy of a lost work by Hieronymus Bosch, and which is currently considered to be based on one of his drawings. Max Jakob Friedl\u00e4nder called it 'an old copy', without specifying another work it was copied from.\r The group of singers form the \"yolk\" of the egg, which symbolizes \"fool\" as in \"yokel\". The eel resembles a form of beer (ale). The scene is reminiscent of the similar Ship of Fools. One of the singers is so intent on his song (pointing towards the book) that he doesn't notice that he is being robbed by the lute player.\r Modern attribution of the painting (to an as yet anonymous follower of Bosch) was based on an analysis of the music in the open book, which shows notes by Thomas Crecquillon from 1549. The work was bought in 1890 for 400 francs by the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille from Morhange, a parisian art dealer.

The left and right panels measure 167.7 x 60\u00a0cm and the center panel measures 164 x 127\u00a0cm. It is not to be confused with either a fragmented piece of art by Bosch under the same title (now at Munich), or another full painting by Bosch, possibly by a painter in his workshop.\r The left panel shows the Garden of Eden, at the top God is shown seated in Heaven while the Rebel Angels are cast out of Heaven and transformed into insects. At the foot of the panel, God creates Eve from the rib of Adam. In the midground Eve is tempted by the Serpent, while the couple are finally seen being chased by the Angel into the dark forest, in the central panel where Jesus judges the souls while surrounded by the Saints. The right panel shows a hellscape, where the wicked are punished.\r The oldest mention of the painting is in a 1659 inventory of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria's collection, as by \"Hieronimo Bosz\". In the late 18th century, the work was acquired by count Lambert-Spritzenstein, from whom it later went to the current location. In the 17th-18th centuries, the triptych has been widely repainted and has lost part of the colors.\r Some art historians identified this work as that acquired by Philip I of Castile in 1504, while others deny this. Dendrochronologic analysis proved that the painting was executed not before 1482 There is copy of the work, attributed to Lucas Cranach the Elder, in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie of Berlin.\r The painting's composition has similarities with the Haywain Triptych or the Garden of Earthly Delights: both also show the Garden of Eden in the left panel and the Hell at right. The central panel depicts a Last Judgement, in a more obscure atmosphere than the Hell one.\r Like in other contemporary Flemish triptychs, the shutters are externally painted in grisaille, depicting two saints.

In the upper section Bosch portrayed God sitting on his throne, surrounded by a luminous halo. Around him is a cloudy sky, with angels fighting rebellious angels who are turning into devils as they fall.\r Below are, reading from the bottom, God creating Eve from Adam's rib, with Adam sleeping at her feet; the Serpent tempting Eve and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; and, finally, Adam and Eve expelled from the Garden by an angel, who holds a sword, into a dark forest.\n", "\nArtist: Hieronymus Bosch\nArtwork Name: Crucifixion with a Donor\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/crucifixion-with-a-donor-1485\n\nWikipedia Article:\nCrucifixion With a Donor is a painting by Hieronymus Bosch believed to be painted between 1480 and 1485.

Since 1898 its authenticity has been questioned several times. In 2015 the Bosch Research Conservation Project claimed it to be by a follower, but scholars at the Prado, where the painting hangs, dismissed this argument. The painting is oil on wooden panels and is presented in a series of circular images.\r Four small circles, detailing the four last things \u2014 Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell \u2014 surround a larger circle in which the seven deadly sins are depicted: wrath at the bottom, then (proceeding clockwise) envy, greed, gluttony, sloth, extravagance (later replaced with lust), and pride, using scenes from life rather than allegorical representations of the sins.\r At the centre of the large circle, which is said to represent the eye of God, is a \"pupil\" in which Christ can be seen emerging from his tomb. Below this image is the Latin inscription Cave cave d[omi]ns videt (\"Beware, Beware, The Lord Sees\").\r Above and below the central image are inscription in Latin of Deuteronomy 32:28\u201329, containing the lines \"For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them\", above, and \"O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!\" below.\r In 1560, Felipe de Guevara wrote about a pupil of Bosch, an unnamed discipulo (pupil), who was as good as his master and even signed his works with his master's name. Immediately after this, and without starting a new paragraph, Guevara refers to the painting of the Seven Deadly Sins as characteristic of his style. This led some scholars, as early as Dollmayr (1898) and most vocally Stechow (1966), to ascribe the work to this pupil.\r Most experts have argued since, however, that given the highly ambiguous nature of the passage, Guevara had probably returned to a description of the works of Bosch himself. Furthermore, the accuracy and authority of Guevara is suspect: when in 1570 Guevara's heirs sold a copy of The Haywain Triptych to Phillip II of Spain, it was made clear that Guevara had regarded that work as the original painted by Bosch himself, whilst nowadays it is known that his was a copy (displayed in El Escorial), of the original hanging in Prado. Phillip II of Spain himself purchased the work (prior to 1560, probably from a monastery art sale) in the belief that The Seven Deadly Sins was a Bosch original, and he always regarded it as such. It was his favourite Bosch painting and it hung in his own bedroom in El Escorial. When he donated the painting to El Escorial in 1574, it was cataloged as being a Bosch original; Silva Maroto argued that it is hard to believe that Guevara would question the authorship of Phillip's favourite Bosch in an ambiguous manuscript that remained unpublished until 1788.\r The alleged poor quality of the drawing had led to the incorrect belief it dates from Bosch's early period. The attribution to the discipulo was revived in the catalogue of the 2001 Bosch exhibition in Rotterdam, by Vermet and Vandenbroeck, who also suggested that several of the costumes suggest a much later date, around 1500, so that the awkward drawing and execution cannot be attributed to youthful imperfection. They also noted that the painting is not on oak, adding to their doubts about the attribution to Bosch.\n", "\nArtist: Hieronymus Bosch\nArtwork Name: Last Judgement\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/last-judgement\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Last Judgment is a triptych of disputed authorship, either by Hieronymus Bosch, his workshop, or a collaboration between artist and workshop.

As for most of Bosch's works, dating has been long disputed, dates having varied from 1490\u20131500 to 1495\u20131505. However, dendochronologic analysis has proved that it has been painted not after 1482.\r St. Jerome was a frequent subject of 15th century European art, depicted in his studio or during his penitence in the desert. Bosch for this picture adopted the latter iconography, although his saint is prone instead of kneeling. He is praying with a crucifix in his arms, also an unusual gesture of communion with Christ.\r Jerome lies on a rock located under a kind of shell-like cave. He is surrounded by his traditional symbols (the lion - although in this case it has a smaller size than usual - the galero, the Bible), but Bosch, as common in his works, also added some bizarre elements, such as the bony pig or the spherical shell emerging from the pool .

The surviving painting is a fragment of a triptych that was cut into several parts. The Ship of Fools was painted on one of the wings of the altarpiece, and is about two thirds of its original length. The bottom third of the panel belongs to Yale University Art Gallery and is exhibited under the title Allegory of Gluttony. The wing on the other side, which has more or less retained its full length, is the Death and the Miser, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.. The two panels together would have represented the two extremes of prodigality and miserliness, condemning and caricaturing both.\r Dendrochronological study has dated the wood to 1491, and it is tempting to see the painting as a response to Sebastian Brant's Das Narrenschiff or even the illustrations of the first edition of 1493. Another possible source for the ship allegory is the 14th-century Le P\u00e8lerinage de l'\u00c2me by Guillaume de Deguileville , which was printed in Dutch in 1486 (shortly after William Caxton printed it as The Pylgremage of the Sowle in 1483).\r A Drawing of the Ship of Fools\u00a0(nl), also in the Louvre, appears to be a later copy.\r Dendrochronological studies by Peter Klein have radically altered the provenance of some paintings, for instance the Escorial Crowning with Thorns panel can only have been painted after 1525 and so is not a Bosch original. The same goes for the Rotterdam Marriage feast at Cana panel which can only have been painted after 1553. It has also become clear that the Rotterdam Pedlar tondo, the Paris Ship of Fools panel and the Washington Death of a Miser panel have been painted on wood from the same tree.\r The two to eight years between the felling of the tree and its use as a painting substrate allows The Ship of Fools to be a direct satire of a frontispiece of Sebastian Brant's book.\n", "\nArtist: Hieronymus Bosch\nArtwork Name: Saint Christopher\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/saint-christopher\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSt. Christopher Carrying the Christ Child is a painting by Hieronymus Bosch, dating to between 1490 and 1500.

It is in the Gallerie dell'Accademia, in Venice, Italy.\r This painting is part of a polyptych of four panels entitled Visions of the Hereafter. The others are Terrestrial Paradise, Fall of the Damned into Hell and Hell.\r The most intriguing element of this painting is the large tunnel at the top of the panel. It appears from the perspective of looking through a straw and into the heavenly beyond. As Stephen Hitchens writes, it could also be described as a \u201cfunnel of goodness and light [as] a source of variety and surprise capturing the visionary and ecstatic union with God.\u201d The three dimensional tunnel gives the viewer a peek of the \u201cwhite light\u201d from Heaven with three figures waiting at the end for the blessed. The near side of the tunnel has one angel carrying a human soul towards the pearly gates. The viewer can differentiate the two figures because one has a white robe with wings and the other is naked, thus a soul and an angel. Both have their hands in prayer formation.\r Right beneath the tunnel, there is an array of angels helping blessed human souls towards salvation. In the lower parts of the panel there are two angels per one soul, suggesting that some humans need more help than others. As it gets closer to the top of the panel, there is a one to one ratio of angel and soul. This might symbolize that the human souls that are pulled from Earth\u2019s gravity and towards the tunnel become lighter in weight. The angels have their hands either on the human body carrying it upwards or near the body simply guiding it where to go. All the figures in the painting are looking upwards towards the tunnel.\r All the characters have similar facial features because the physical aspect of the humans and angels are more idealized and not individualized. The figures are not meant to look like specific individual people. The style of the hair is also quite idealized; the angels have long wavy hair and the souls have short hair. None of the human souls have organs to help differentiate whether they are male or female. This could be a form of symbolism which shows that there are no genders in Heaven. This could be implying that all human souls are no longer differentiated by sexual organs and everyone is the same. The angels have a multitude of different colored robes and wings, such as subtle reds, blues, and greens.\r The painting as a whole is very dimly lit which contrasts with the white brightness at the end of the tunnel. The light at the end of the tunnel is not the light that lights up the bottom of the painting, which is most likely the earthly realm. The extreme darkness directly around the tunnel indicates that the heavenly light has nothing to do with the light coming from below. The areas outside the tunnel are dark and gray. The light actually becomes darker as it moves upwards then when it reaches the tunnel there is a sudden eruption of light. Coincidentally, this painting of the funnel has been known to look very similar to people who have had near-death experiences. During the fifteenth-century, the entrance to paradise was depicted as a funnel which appeared in many miniatures. The shape of the radiant funnel actually has some resemblance to contemporary zodiac diagrams but Bosch transforms it into a shining corridor through which the blessed approach God.\n", "\nArtist: Hieronymus Bosch\nArtwork Name: St. Liberata Triptych\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/st-liberata-triptych-1504\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Crucifixion of St Julia is a triptych by the Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch. Like many Bosch paintings, the date of this work was long disputed, until dendochronologic analysis assigned it to around 1497. It is housed at the Palazzo Ducale in Venice.\r According to some historians, Bosch could have painted this work during a short trip to northern Italy, although it is more likely that it was a commission from an Italian trader or diplomat active in the Flanders.\r The earliest mention of the triptych comes from the 1771 treatise Della pittura veneziana, as located in the Palazzo Ducale's \"Sala dell'Eccelso Tribunale\". In 1893 it was moved by the Austrians to Vienna, where it remained until 1919 when it was returned to Venice. The work has been damaged by a fire, although its attribution to Bosch has never been disputed.\r The central panel depicts the crucifixion of a saint usually identified with Saint Julia of Corsica (sometimes with Saint Wilgefortis). In a depiction related to Christ's crucifixion, the centrally themed woman is in an elevated position against the sky, balanced by a large crowd gathered at the foot of the cross, including executioners and common people. A typical element is the fainting man supported by his neighbors.\r The sides show two cities: at right, a port characterized by fanciful domed buildings and several sunken ships; at left is city on fire, occupied by demons.

In 1838 it was removed by the Austrian authorities, then ruling Venice, to the Imperial Gallery of Vienna in Austria, from which, in 1893, it went to the Kunsthistorisches Museum. In 1919 it was returned to Venice.\r The work has been badly damaged, perhaps by a fire: in particular in the central part, the sky, the landscape and the head of St. Jerome have been repainted. The date of 1493 has been confirmed by dendochronologic analysis.\r Each of the three panels portrays a different Christian anchorite saint. In the center is Saint Jerome, kneeling in the desert and praying at a crucifix on a stick. The setting is an altar resembling a sculpted Roman sarcophagus, located within a ruined oratory. The reliefs depicts scenes connected to the redemption theme, such as Judith and Holophernes (symbolizing the victory of the soul, or Mary killing the devil), a knight and a unicorn, symbol of virginity. In the lower part is a man diving into a beehive and covering himself with honey, perhaps an allusion to carnal love or to alchemic mercury. This detail is depicted in a drawing housed in the Albertina in Vienna. All around are symbols of evil, scattered in a desert and dark landscape and surrounded by a sinister vegetation. They include, at left, a column with an idolater adoring the atmospheric phenomena, skeletons, monstrous animals fighting each other and dried bush. At right are instead Jerome's traditional symbols, the red cardinal's hat and the lion, identifiable with the bony animal drinking at the pool.\r The left panel portrays St. Anthony the Abbot in a nocturnal landscape. The village in fire is perhaps an allegory of the ergotism plague, or of the saint's alleged capability to quench fires. The saint is collecting the marshy water of a pool with a jar, surrounded by demonic visions such as the naked woman appearing behind a tent in company of several devils. Under her, a devil-fish is pouring wine from a jar, while around it are deformed crickets portrayed in grotesque postures: one is reading a missal, one has a prolonged beak and a peacock tail, while another is composed by a nun head with feet, which carries a little owl and its nest above.\r The right panel shows Saint Giles, who is praying in a grotto; this houses a roll which, according to the Golden Legend, contained all the names of those to be saved thanks to his intercession. The saint has been shot by an arrow, originally destined to the fawn at his feet. The landscape, the less dark of the triptych, is dominated by a sharp rock.\r The scientists at The Bosch Research and Conservation Project investigated all the technical aspects of this triptych. Bosch employed the usual pigments of the Renaissance period, such as azurite, lead-tin-yellow, vermilion and ochres omitting the expensive natural ultramarine.\n", "\nArtist: Hieronymus Bosch\nArtwork Name: Christ Carrying the Cross\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/christ-carrying-the-cross-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nChrist Carrying the Cross is a painting by Hieronymus Bosch.

The work tells the story of the mental and spiritual torments endured by Saint Anthony the Great (Anthony Abbot), one of the most prominent of the Desert Fathers of Egypt in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries. The Temptation of St. Anthony was a popular subject in Medieval and Renaissance art. In common with many of Bosch's works, the triptych contains much fantastic imagery. The painting hangs in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga in Lisbon.  According to some historians, the work could be one of the three Temptations recorded in the inventory of Philip II of Spain sent to the Escorial in 1574. However, it is now considered more likely that the triptych was that bought by the Portuguese humanist Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is between 1523 and 1545. In fact, the painting was documented as part of the collections in the Royal Palace of Lisbon in the mid-19th century, and in 1911 King Manuel II donated it to its current museum.  Although the painting has usually been attributed to the period 1490\u20131500, dendochronologic analysis has assigned it to around 1501.  Like many of Bosch's paintings, The Temptation of St. Anthony was the subject of a number of copies. Another version of the central panel is found in MASP in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, while a copy by a follower of Bosch can be found in the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, and another version in the Prado Museum in Madrid. A third copy (once believed to be the original but now identified by Larry Silver, an art historian at the University of Pennsylvania, as a 16th-century copy) is owned by the Barnes Foundation, near Philadelphia, USA.  The Temptation of St. Anthony is an  oil painting on three wooden panels, having the form of a triptych, the two outer panels being hinged shutters to the central section.  The centre panel measures 131.5 by 119\u00a0cm, and the wings measure 131.5 by 53\u00a0cm.  The work tells symbolically the story of the mental and spiritual torments endured by St. Anthony Abbott throughout his life. The sources for the subjects were Athanasius of Alexandria's Life of St. Anthony, which had been popularized in Flanders by Pieter van Os, and Jacopo da Varazze's Golden Legend.  The left panel portrays the legendary flight and the fall of St. Anthony. In the sky, the saint is brought down by a host of demons. Below, is the saint's grotto (or a brothel), carved within a hill in the shape of a man on all fours, whose backside forms the entrance. An impious procession is directed towards the latter, led by a demon wearing holy vestments and by a deer. In the foreground is a tired-out Anthony, supported after the fall by a monk and a layman; the latter has been traditionally identified as Bosch himself.  Under the bridge which crosses an icy lake are three figures, one of which is a monk reading a letter. Also on the lake is a demon bird with skates: its beak holds a cartouche with the word \"fat\". This could be a reference to the simony scandal.\n", "\nArtist: Hieronymus Bosch\nArtwork Name: Christ Carrying the Cross\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/the-carrying-of-the-cross-1480\n\nWikipedia Article:\nChrist Carrying the Cross is a painting attributed to a follower of Hieronymus Bosch. It was painted in the early 16th century, presumably between 1500 and 1535.  The work is housed in the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent, Belgium.  The work was bought by the Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent in 1902, and was restored in 1956\u20131957. As for all Bosch related works, the dating is uncertain, although most art historians assigned it to his late career. The catalog of the Bosch exhibition held in Rotterdam in 2001 assigned it 1510\u20131535, attributing the execution to an imitator. According to one of the authors, Bernard Vermet, it is not as typical for Bosch is generally accepted and he finds it hard to believe that it was painted by the same painter as the Christ Crowned with Thorns (Bosch, London) in National Gallery in London. Moreover the colours remind him of the manierists of the 1530' and he relates the work to the Triptych of the Passion in Valencia and the Christ before Pilate in Princeton, works that were definitely painted after the death of Bosch. Since then the rejection has been accepted by Stephan Fischer and disputed by Fritz Koreny In October 2015 the Bosch Research and Conservation Project, that is doing technical research on most of Bosch's paintings since 2007, confirmed they reject the attribution to Bosch as well and consider it to be made by a follower. The museum's director was quoted on the same occasion as stating that if it was not by Bosch, then by a genius even greater than Bosch.  The work depicts Jesus carrying the cross above a dark background, surrounded by numerous heads, most of which are characterized with grotesque faces. There are a total of eighteen portraits, plus one on Veronica's veil. Jesus has a woeful expression, his closed eyes and the head reclinate.  In the bottom right corner is the impenitent thief, who sneers against three men who are mocking him. The penitent thief is at top right: he is portrayed with a very pale skin, while being confessed by a horribly ugly monk.  The bottom left corner houses Veronica with the holy shroud, her eyes half-open and the face looking back. Finally, at the top left is Simon of Cyrene, his face upside upturned.  There are two further versions of the subject by Bosch: a previous one from around 1498, now at the Royal Palace of Madrid, and another in the Kunsthistorisches Museum of Vienna from around 1500.\n", "\nArtist: Hieronymus Bosch\nArtwork Name: The Garden of\u00a0Earthly Delights\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/the-garden-of-earthly-delights-1515-7\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Garden of Earthly Delights is the modern title given to a triptych oil painting on oak panel painted by the Early Netherlandish master Hieronymus Bosch, housed in the Museo del Prado in Madrid since 1939. It dates from between 1490 and 1510, when Bosch was between 40 and 60\u00a0years old.\r As so little is known of Bosch's life or intentions, interpretations of his intent have ranged from an admonition of worldly fleshy indulgence, to a dire warning on the perils of life's temptations, to an evocation of ultimate sexual joy. The intricacy of its symbolism, particularly that of the central panel, has led to a wide range of scholarly interpretations over the centuries. Twentieth-century art historians are divided as to whether the triptych's central panel is a moral warning or a panorama of paradise lost. Peter S. Beagle describes it as an \"erotic derangement that turns us all into voyeurs, a place filled with the intoxicating air of perfect liberty\".\r Bosch painted three large triptychs (the others are The Last Judgment of c. 1482 and The Haywain Triptych of c. 1516) that can be read from left to right and in which each panel was essential to the meaning of the whole. Each of these three works presents distinct yet linked themes addressing history and faith. Triptychs from this period were generally intended to be read sequentially, the left and right panels often portraying Eden and the Last Judgment respectively, while the main subject was contained in the center piece. It is not known whether \"The Garden\" was intended as an altarpiece, but the general view is that the extreme subject matter of the inner center and right panels make it unlikely that it was intended to function in a church or monastery, but was instead commissioned by a lay patron.\r When the triptych's wings are closed, the design of the outer panels becomes visible. Rendered in a green\u2013gray grisaille, these panels lack colour, probably because most Netherlandish triptychs were thus painted, but possibly indicating that the painting reflects a time before the creation of the sun and moon, which were formed, according to Christian theology, to \"give light to the earth\". It was common for the outer panels of Netherlandish altarpieces to be in grisaille, such that their blandness highlighted the splendid colour inside.\r The outer panels are generally thought to depict the creation of the world, showing greenery beginning to clothe the still-pristine Earth. God, wearing a crown similar to a papal tiara (a common convention in Netherlandish painting), is visible as a tiny figure at the upper left. Bosch shows God as the father sitting with a Bible on his lap, creating the Earth in a passive manner by divine fiat. Above him is inscribed a quote from Psalm 33 reading \"Ipse dixit, et facta sunt: ipse mand\u0101vit, et cre\u0101ta sunt\"\u2014For he spake and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. The Earth is encapsulated in a transparent sphere recalling the traditional depiction of the created world as a crystal sphere held by God or Christ. It hangs suspended in the cosmos, which is shown as an impermeable darkness, whose only other inhabitant is God himself.\n", "\nArtist: Hieronymus Bosch\nArtwork Name: The Haywain Triptych (detail)\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/not_detected_195349\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Haywain Triptych is a panel painting by Hieronymus Bosch, currently housed in the Museo del Prado, Madrid, Spain. A date of around 1516 has been established by means of dendrochronological research. The central panel, signed \"Jheronimus Bosch\", measures 135 by 200 centimeters and the wings measure 147 \u00d7 66\u00a0cm. The outside shutters feature a version of Bosch's The Wayfarer.\r The painting was part of a group of six acquired by king Philip II of Spain in 1570, and shipped to El Escorial four years later. It was later sold to the Marquis of Salamanca, and divided into three paintings. In 1848, the central panel was bought by Isabella II of Spain and brought to Aranjuez, the right one was returned to Escorial and the left went to the Prado. The triptych was finally recomposed in 1914 in the latter museum. A copy exists at the Escorial.\r The exterior of the shutters, like most contemporary Netherlandish triptychs, were also painted, although in this case Bosch used full colors instead of the usual grisaille. When closed, they form a single scene depicting a wayfarer. Around him is a series of miniatures including the robbery of another wayfarer and a hanged man. The man uses a stick to repel a dog.\r According to the most recent interpretations, this figure may represent the man who follows his road in spite of the temptation of sins (such as lust, perhaps symbolized by the two dancing shepherds) and the evil acts occurring around him.\r The Haywain triptych follows a similar narrative to The Garden of Earthly Delights. The left panel shows God giving form to Eve. Unlike the Garden, though, a narrative sequence flows through the panel in different scenes. At the top, the rebel angels are cast out of Heaven while God sits enthroned, the angels turning into insects as they break through the clouds. Below this, God creates Eve from the rib of Adam. Next, Adam and Eve find the serpent and the tree; the serpent offers them an apple. Finally, at the lowest part of the panel, the angel forces the two out of the Garden of Eden. Adam speaks with the angel; Eve, in a melancholic pose, looks ahead to the right.\r The central panel features a large wagon of hay surrounded by a multitude of fools engaged in a variety of sins, quite apart from the sins of lust which dominates the Garden of Earthly Delights. In the center panel Bosch shows Christ in the sky, not paralleled in the Garden. An angel on top of the wagon looks to the sky, praying, but none of the other figures see Christ looking down on the world. The rightward bow of the figures around the wagon provides the force for the viewer\u2019s eye to move with them on their journey and the cart is drawn by infernal beings which drag everyone to Hell, depicted on the right panel.\r The forward kinetic motion of the participants moves the viewer from present-day sin into unadulterated torture in the realms of Hell. The procession on the left side of this panel bends back into the middle ground, but the right side figures continue in a straight line with the wagon, a more evident progress into damnation.\n", "\nArtist: Hieronymus Bosch\nArtwork Name: Death and the Miser\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/death-and-the-miser-1516\n\nWikipedia Article:\nDeath and the Miser is a Hieronymus Bosch painting. It is currently in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The painting is the inside of the right panel of a divided triptych. The other existing portions of the triptych are The Ship of Fools and Allegory of Gluttony and Lust, while The Wayfarer was painted on the external right panel.\r Death and the Miser belongs to the tradition of the memento mori, works that remind the viewer of the inevitability of death. The painting shows the influence of popular 15th-century handbooks on the art of dying (Ars moriendi), intended to help Christians choose Christ over sinful pleasures. As Death looms, the miser, unable to resist worldly temptations, reaches for the bag of gold offered by a demon, even while an angel points to a crucifix from which a slender beam of light descends.\r There are references in the painting to dichotomous modes of life. A crucifix is set on the only (small) window of the room. A thin ray of light is directed down to the bottom of the large room, which is darkened. A demon holding an ember lurks over the dying man, waiting for his hour. Death is dressed in flowing robes.\r In the foreground, Bosch possibly depicts the miser as he was previously, in full health, storing gold in his money chest (which abounds with demons) while clutching his rosary. Symbols of worldly power such as a helmet, sword and shield allude to earthly follies \u2014 and hint at the station held by this man during his life, though his final struggle is one he must undergo naked, without arms or armor. The depiction of such still-life objects to symbolize earthly vanity, transience or decay would become a genre in itself among 17th-century Flemish artists.\r Whether or not the miser, in his last moments, will embrace the salvation offered by Christ or cling to his worldly riches, is left uncertain.\r Bosch's familiarity with the visual tradition of the Ars Moriendi can be seen in the top left roundel depicting the death of a sinner in The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things. There are several points of similarity, such as the figure of Death and the juxtaposition of an angel and devil at the headboard.\n", "\nArtist: Hieronymus Bosch\nArtwork Name: Adoration of the Child\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/adoration-of-the-child\n\nWikipedia Article:\nAdoration of the Child is a painting by Hieronymus Bosch portraying Mary and the Christ Child.

It shows the artist twice; once in bust form looking at the viewer as if to say \"Behold the wonders of Rome!\" and again as an artist sketching the Colisseum. Heemskerck painted it upon his arrival in Italy whereupon it came into the collection of Anton Perrenot de Granvella (d. 1586). Unlike what the arrangement would have the observer believe, this was not painted 'en plein air' because all paintings were created in the studio until well into the 18th-century.\r The image of the Colisseum has been identified with an undated sketch currently in Berlin that itself was a model for Pieter Jansz. Saenredam for his 1631 painting. Saenredam is known to have had in his possession many sketches by Heemskerck that he used as models. A description of the sketches of ruins that Heemskerck made while in Rome was documented by Karel van Mander in his Schilder-boeck, who mentioned the patronage of a Cardinal (presumably Cardinal Granvelle).

A large painting, it depicts a peasant market scene, with an abundance of meats and other foods. In the background, it shows a scene from the biblical theme of the flight into Egypt, where the Virgin Mary is seen stopped on the road, giving alms to the poor. Thus, although the painting seems to be at first sight an ordinary still life concentrating on foodstuffs, it is rich with symbolism; it in fact hides a symbolic religious meaning, and embodies a visual metaphor encouraging spiritual life. Aertsen made a name for himself during the 1550s painting scenes from everyday life in a naturalistic manner.\r Pieter Aertsen was a masterful still-life painter from Amsterdam, who worked for many years in Antwerp. He was a representative of the 16th-century Northern Renaissance style, more specifically Northern Mannerism, a new era for painting in the Netherlands and the German countries characterised by precise observation and naturalism that gave the art of painting impulses of realism. Many Northern artists travelled to Italy to study, where they were influenced by the innovations of the Italian Renaissance and in turn influenced the Italian Renaissance painters with techniques such as the newly developed technique of oil painting.\r Aertsen is regarded as one of the founders of the still life painting. His style was particularly new: he mixed characteristics of the still life and the genre painting in his works, which, like A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms, are seen as pioneers in the still life genre that grew out of details of paintings containing figure subjects. His compositions in the Flemish tradition were remarkably original, like this painting of a meat stall, with a large, life-size still life in the foreground and three smaller scenes appearing through openings in the background.\r Since the Protestants rejected the tradition of Catholic arts, many of Aertsen's paintings were destroyed by the iconoclasts, especially his altarpieces, some of which were chopped into pieces. Only the parts of the paintings containing the less religious details were spared. Thus, the era of religious paintings declined in the Protestant countries. Aertsen painted A Meat Stall a few years before he moved to Amsterdam from Antwerpen.\r The artwork of A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms consists of a large painting on panel in oil, depicting a profusion of foodstuffs in a highly realistic style, while the narrative is hidden in the background, seen through the stall windows and openings. Aertsen's paintings were often made in an \"inverted still life\" style in which the still-life aspects were in the foreground and the narrative aspects in the background. The viewer's senses are distracted by the rich display of various foods\u00a0\u2013 plates in the foreground, meats, ham, lard, smoked fish, pigs' legs and head, bread, butter, milk, cheese and hanging pretzels (in the left corner)\u00a0\u2013 that has been spread out in front of the viewer, and the figure subject is overwhelmed by the still-life composition. The various meats, including sausages, beef, fish, fowl and pork, are arranged on wooden tables, using baskets, pots and plates. A barrel and some wickerwork chairs serve as containers for the food items as well.\n", "\nArtist: Hendrick Terbrugghen\nArtwork Name: St. Sebastian Tended by Irene and her Maid\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hendrick-terbrugghen/st-sebastian-tended-by-irene-and-her-maid-1625\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Sebastian Tended by Irene is an oil-on-canvas painting by Hendrick ter Brugghen dated to 1625. Now in the Allen Memorial Art Museum of Oberlin, Ohio, the piece depicts the Roman Catholic subject of Saint Sebastian being saved by Irene of Rome and her maid following his attempted martyrdom by the Roman authorities. An exemplary piece of the Italianate Baroque tendency in Dutch Golden Age painting, the painting employs dramatic uses of light and skillful chiaroscuro to depict its religious subject, evidence of influence from Caravaggio and Ter Brugghen's fellow Utrecht Caravaggisti.\r It was described by Seymour Slive as ter Brugghen's \"masterpiece\": \"the large, full, forms of the group have been knit together into a magnificent design, and what could have been hard and sculptural is remarkably softened by the soft, silvery light which plays over Sebastian's half-dead, olive-grey body as well as the reds, creamy whites, and plum colours worn by the women who tend the saint\".\r The piece is recorded in the collection of Pieter Eris in Amsterdam during the 1660s. Its full provenance remains speculation; perhaps it was intended for a charitable institution where the sick were cared for, such as those with the plague which became prevalent in the Netherlands around the 1600s. Others supposed it was intended for a hidden church or private chapel, and then later reached the art market. It has also been suggested that the painting was commissioned by a schutterij (militia company) though this idea has generally been dismissed. It seems most likely to have been commissioned by Catholics, as the subject is virtually specific to Counter-Reformation art, though Ter Brugghen was himself Protestant. The painting eventually found its way to a Frederick Mont, from whom the painting was purchased by Oberlin College in 1953. The piece has been exhibited in the Washington, D.C.\u2019s National Gallery of Art, Utrecht\u2019s Centraal Museum and New York\u2019s The Metropolitan Museum of Art.\r Saint Sebastian Tended by Irene was a mainly 17th-century subject, though found in predella scenes as early as the 15th century. It was painted by Georges de La Tour, Trophime Bigot (four times), Jusepe de Ribera, and others. It may have been a deliberate attempt by the Church to get away from the usual single nude treatment of the subject, which is already recorded in Vasari as sometimes arousing inappropriate thoughts among female churchgoers. The Baroque artists usually treated it as a nocturnal chiaroscuro scene, illuminated by a single candle, torch or lantern, in the style fashionable in the first half of the 17th century, and typically set it in an interior, after Sebastian has been carried away. Ter Brugghen's outside setting and choice of the earlier moment are unusual, though shared by the treatment of the subject by Dirck van Baburen.\r This painting depicts Sebastian, slumped in pain as he is tended to by Saint Irene and her maid. According to the traditional story, the Emperor Diocletian, in the Diocletianic Persecution, has the soldier Sebastian shot by archers as punishment for his treason. Looking for his body to bury, Irene found Saint Sebastian tied to a tree and miraculously alive, then nursed him back to health. Rather than painting the scene of Sebastian being shot with arrows, in the midst of his attempted execution, Ter Brugghen chooses to show the moments afterwards where Irene and her maid untie him from the tree. Some attribute this narrative shift to the emergence of the plague within Utrecht in the 1600s: several artists desiring a subject saved from agony, turn to painting the rescue of the Catholicism's personification of suffering. Ter Brugghen\u2019s depicts Sebastian with a sickly green pallor, his limp body lying in suffering and resembling much of the diseased or dead one would encounter in Utrecht at the time.\n", "\nArtist: Pieter Codde\nArtwork Name: The Meagre Company\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-codde/the-meagre-company-1637\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Meagre Company, or The company of Captain Reinier Reael and Lieutenant Cornelis Michielsz Blaeuw, refers to the only militia group portrait, or schutterstuk, painted by Frans Hals outside of Haarlem, and today is in the collection of the Amsterdam Museum, on loan to the Rijksmuseum, where it is considered one of its main attractions of the Honor Gallery. Hals was unhappy about commuting to Amsterdam to work on the painting and, unlike his previous group portraits, was unable to deliver it on time. The sitters contracted Pieter Codde to finish the work.\r Hals was originally contracted in 1633, after the favorable reception of his previous militia group portrait, The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1633, in which all ensigns are holding flags and all officers are holding their weapons. The sergeants were shown, holding halberds to differentiate them from officers with spontoons. Hals seems to have initially intended an Amsterdam version of the same painting, beginning on the left with a smiling flag bearer wearing a flamboyant cut-sleeve jacket with lace and holding a flag in the color of his sash. Though it is impossible to tell on which side of the canvas Hals began painting, the light falls onto the figures from the left in the \"standard\" Hals tradition and this is also where the most important figures are situated within the painting. Since each sitter paid for his own portrait, it is presumed that Hals began with the most important sitters in order to \"sell\" canvas room to other paying officers. Whether or not Hals did in fact start on the left or drew a sketch of the entire group at once, the flag bearer on the left in this painting has been painted in a remarkably flamboyant way from the tip of his hat to the toe of his boots. This was possibly to prove to the decision makers in Amsterdam that Hals was capable of painting a schutterstuk in the \"Amsterdam style\", which included the entire figure. In Haarlem, the civic guards were traditionally portrayed in the kniestuk style of being \"cut off at the knee\" in three-quarter length portraits.\r The flag bearer is Nicolaes van Bambeeck. Seated next to him are Captain Reael, with hat and commander's staff, and Lieutenant Cornelis Michielsz Blaeuw, balding and holding a spontoon. The further to the right, however, the less the two paintings resemble each other. In 1636 Hals was called to Amsterdam to finish the painting, but he refused, offering to receive the sitters in his Haarlem studio with assurances that they would not need to sit very long. His offer was refused and Codde was hired to finish the piece. Because the men are thinner than the men portrayed in other, later, Amsterdam schutterstukken hanging near this painting, the piece was later nicknamed the \"meagre company\". Besides the ensign and the seated men, the names of the other officers are unknown today.\r The impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh was inspired by the painting, which he saw when he paid a visit to the Night Watch in the newly opened Rijksmuseum in 1885. He sent an enthusiastic letter about it to his brother Theo:\n", "\nArtist: Rembrandt\nArtwork Name: The Stoning Of St. Stephen\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/the-stoning-of-st-stephen-1625\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Stoning of Saint Stephen is the first signed painting by Dutch artist Rembrandt, painted in 1625 at the age of 19.

This young deacon in the Christian community of Jerusalem was sentenced to death by stoning. The painting was influenced by the art of Caravaggio and Adam Elsheimer. It represents the moment when Stephen was stoned outside the city by his many tormentors (about twenty characters), and he utters his last words to Christ as the light around him shows that the heavens are open.\r The painting is divided into two distinct zones with a diagonal creating an effect of chiaroscuro: on the left, a man on horseback is in the shadow, and on the right, Stephen and his persecutors are in the light. Saul of Tarsus can be seen seated in the background holding in his lap the coats of the stoners. Some inaccuracies in the drawing can be seen.

The work depicts the Raising of Lazarus as told in the Gospel of John, Chapter 11. It is in the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\r The painting shows the moment Lazarus re-awakens from death and rises from his tomb as Christ calls him. Lazarus is in the darker half of the painting while the figures at left are far more illuminated than he. Mary and those assembled look on in amazement as Lazarus comes to life. The painting depicts a parable of spiritual life, the miracle of the hardened sinner receiving first grace (sorrow for sins committed in order to seek penitence and redemption).  Rembrandt used chiaroscuro (contrasts of light and dark) in this painting, with the dark interior of the burial cave and the limited torchlight focusing the attention of the viewer and giving the figures impact. This is one of relatively few religious subjects from the New Testament that Rembrandt painted, though there are many such prints.\r Rembrandt painted The Raising of Lazarus early in his career, while he was still in Leiden, and not long after his apprenticeship under Pieter Lastman, whose influence is clear. Rembrandt made two etchings on the same subject but with differing compositions, one in approximately 1632 and another in 1642 (see gallery below). The 1632 etching shows a different point of view while the 1642 etching shows different figures in the cave. The 1642 etching also depicts Christ as more of a healer, rather than the enchanter of this work. (Sister Wendy Beckett opines that Jesus is portrayed in this work as a weary magician rather than a triumphant savior.) The subject of this painting may draw on an undated Jan Lievens etching of the same name. Lievens and Rembrandt were friends and probably worked together. The composition of the painting may derive from a drawing by Rembrandt from the same time as the Burial of Christ. Rembrandt would most closely imitate Raising of Lazarus with his 1635/1639 painting The Resurrection. The placement of the figures is similar and a study of drawings indicates that the latter was developed from the former.\r Raising of Lazarus was owned by Rembrandt for most of his life; it was sold in his bankruptcy sale in 1656. It was inventoried as being hung in Rembrandt\u2019s anteroom. The painting passed through various owners in Europe until it was bought by Howard F. Ahmanson, Sr. in 1959 and then donated to the LA County Museum of Art.\n", "\nArtist: Rembrandt\nArtwork Name: Andromeda\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: board,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/andromeda\n\nWikipedia Article:\nAndromeda Chained to the Rocks (1630) is a 34 x 25 oil on panel painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Rembrandt. It is now in the Mauritshuis, The Hague, Netherlands. Andromeda represents Rembrandt's first full length mythological female nude history painting and is taken from a story in Ovid's Metamorphoses.\r In Metamorphoses, Andromeda (mythology) is the daughter of an Ethiopian king and queen, Cepheus and Cassiopeia. Cassiopeia was very boastful about her beauty, and asserted that she was more beautiful than Juno, the queen of the gods and the Nereids. Insulted by Cassiopeia's assertions, Neptune sent a sea monster to the Ethiopian coast. Neptune then could only be appeased upon the sacrifice of Andromeda, the kings beautiful virgin daughter, to the sea monster. Andromeda was chained naked to rocks by the coast, awaiting the sea monster. Perseus, passing by, had noticed the beautiful girl and made a deal with her parents that he would save her, should he be allowed to have her hand in marriage. The king and queen agree and Andromeda was spared.\r This painting depicts a classic example of the damsel in distress. In this theme a beautiful young woman is placed in a perilous situation, usually involving a monster or being trapped in captivity. The damsel can then only be rescued by a hero, whom of which she usually ends up marrying. In this painting, Andromeda has a distressed look on her face as she is completely shackled and unable to move. Although Perseus does not make an appearance in this painting, in similar works we can see Perseus being portrayed in a heroic and graceful light, shown through the use of warm colors and heroic poses.\r Many artists such as Titian have depicted this story by showing Andromeda, her rescuer Perseus, and the sea monster all in the same composition. Her beauty as described in her source material can be seen in some of these other works, along with Perseus' role as her rescuer. In this work, Rembrandt shies away from classical conventions by showing her not as a glamorous beauty but as a frightened naturalistic looking girl. No other figure is included, but her alarmed look out of the picture space to the right creates narrative tension. The painting is an example of Rembrandt's rejection of idealized beauty. Since he did not believe true beauty existed naturally, he painted women as he saw them; naturally imperfect and flawed.\r Rembrandt's subsequent nude mythological paintings from this period Diana Bathing and Dana\u00eb show his evolving portrayal of the nude.\n", "\nArtist: Rembrandt\nArtwork Name: Philosopher in Meditation\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: board,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/philosopher-in-meditation-1632\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPhilosopher in Meditation (Bredius 431) is the traditional title of an oil painting in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris, that has long been attributed to the 17th-century Dutch artist Rembrandt.\r It is signed \"RHL-van Rijn\" and dated 1632, at the time of Rembrandt's move from Leiden to Amsterdam. Recent scholarship suggests that the painting depicts \"Tobit and Anna waiting for their son Tobias\" instead. This interpretation appears in the first known source, an auction catalogue from 1738 (see \"Subject matter\").\r The painting appeared in Paris around the middle of the 18th century and made the rounds of aristocratic collections before being acquired for the royal collections housed in the Louvre Palace. The presumed subject matter, the finely graded chiaroscuro treatment and intricate composition were widely appreciated in France and the painting is mentioned in the writings of many 19th- and 20th-century literary figures, including George Sand, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, Jules Michelet, Marcel Proust, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Gaston Bachelard, Paul Claudel, and Aldous Huxley.\r The popularity of the painting may be measured by its presence on the internet, where it is often used as an emblem of philosophy, or interpreted along esoteric or occult lines.\r Painted in oils on an oak panel measuring about 11 x 13 in. (28 x 34\u00a0cm), the painting depicts in slightly accelerated perspective two figures in a partially vaulted interior that is dominated by a wooden spiral staircase. The architecture includes stone, brick and wood, with arched elements (window, vault, doors) that create an impression of monumentality. On the pre-iconographic level, this is one of the most \"graphic\" works painted by Rembrandt, in the sense that it contains many straight, curved, circular, and radiating lines: from the lines of the flagstones to those of the window, the bricks, the wainscotting, and of course the staircase. As in the staircase and the basketwork tray at the center of the composition, the curved lines can be said to organize the straight lines. The first figure is that of an old man seated at a table in front of a window, his head bowed and his hands folded in his lap. The second figure is that of an old woman tending a fire in an open hearth. A third figure\u2014a woman standing in the stairs carrying a basket and turned to the spectator\u2014is visible in 18th- and 19th-century engraved reproductions of the painting, but virtually invisible in the painting's present state. As it is, the overall painting is quite dark due to the aging of the varnish.\r The panel is signed \"RHL-van Rijn 163_\" at the bottom and left of the center, at a vertical from the figure of the old man. The signature is traced in light pigment on a dark background and is quite difficult to make out. The last digit is a tiny blob of paint, the form and placing of which would tally with a \"0,\" \"1\" or \"2.\" The type of signature\u2014monogram plus patronymic\u2014would argue for 1632, for the artist used this type of signature only in this year. This does not mean that the picture was painted in that year or even in Amsterdam, to which Rembrandt had moved in late 1631. In any case, this type of signature is so rare in Rembrandt's oeuvre and date-specific that it argues for authenticity.\n", "\nArtist: Rembrandt\nArtwork Name: The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/the-anatomy-lesson-of-dr-nicolaes-tulp-1632\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp is a 1632 oil painting on canvas by Rembrandt housed in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague, the Netherlands. The painting is regarded as one of Rembrandt's early masterpieces.\r In the work, Dr. Nicolaes Tulp is pictured explaining the musculature of the arm to medical professionals. Some of the spectators are various doctors who paid commissions to be included in the painting. The painting is signed in the top-left hand corner Rembrandt. f[ecit] 1632. This may be the first instance of Rembrandt signing a painting with his forename (in its original form) as opposed to the monogramme RHL (Rembrandt Harmenszoon of Leiden), and is thus a sign of his growing artistic confidence.\r The event can be dated to 31 January 1632: the Amsterdam Guild of Surgeons, of which Tulp was official City Anatomist, permitted only one public dissection a year, and the body would have to be that of an executed criminal.\r Anatomy lessons were a social event in the 17th century, taking place in lecture rooms that were actual theatres, with students, colleagues and the general public being permitted to attend on payment of an entrance fee. The spectators are appropriately dressed for this social occasion. It is thought that the uppermost (not holding the paper) and farthest left figures were added to the picture later.\r Every five to ten years, the Surgeon's Guild would commission a portrait by a leading portraitist of the period; Rembrandt was commissioned for this task when he was 26 years old, and newly arrived in Amsterdam. It was his first major commission in Amsterdam. Each of the men included in the portrait would have paid a certain amount of money to be included in the work, and the more central figures (in this case, Dr. Tulp) probably paid more, even twice as much. Rembrandt's anatomical portrait radically altered the conventions of the genre, by including a full length corpse in the center of the image (using Christ-like iconography) and creating not just a portrait but a dramatic Mise-en-sc\u00e8ne. Rembrandt's image is a fiction; in a typical anatomy lesson, the surgeon would begin by opening the chest cavity and thorax because the internal organs there decay most rapidly.\r One person is missing: the Preparator, whose task was to prepare the body for the lesson. In the 17th century an important scientist such as Dr. Tulp would not be involved in menial and bloody work like dissection, and such tasks would be left to others. It is for this reason that the picture shows no cutting instruments. Instead we see in the lower right corner an enormous open textbook on anatomy, possibly the 1543 De humani corporis fabrica (Fabric of the Human Body) by Andreas Vesalius.\r The corpse is that of the criminal Aris Kindt (alias of Adriaan Adriaanszoon), who was convicted for armed robbery and sentenced to death by hanging. He was executed earlier on the same day of the scene. The face of the corpse is partially shaded, a suggestion of umbra mortis (shadow of death), a technique that Rembrandt was to use frequently.\n", "\nArtist: Rembrandt\nArtwork Name: The Rape of Europe\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/the-rape-of-europe\n\nWikipedia Article:\nRembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn's The Abduction of Europa (1632) is one of his rare mythological subject paintings.  The piece is oil on canvas and now located in the J. Paul Getty Museum.  The inspiration for the painting is Ovid's Metamorphoses, part of which tells the tale of Zeus's seduction and capture of Europa.  The painting shows a coastal scene with Europa being carried away in rough waters by a bull while her friends remain on shore with expressions of horror.  Rembrandt combined his knowledge of classical literature with the interests of the patron in order to create this allegorical work.  The use of an ancient myth to impart a contemporary thought and his portrayal of the scene using the High Baroque style are two strong aspects of the work.  The Abduction of Europa is Rembrandt's reinterpretation of the story, placed in a more contemporary setting.  He developed an interest in the classical world early in his life while in Amsterdam.   Rembrandt moved to Amsterdam in 2018  Jacques Specx, of the Dutch East India Company, commissioned Rembrandt to complete The Abduction of Europa.   Specx had established a trading center in Japan in 1609, served as the Governor of Batavia (former name of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital), and later returned to Holland in 1633.   The painting certainly was in Specx's possession, along with five other portrait pieces, which Rembrandt was popularly known for completing.  The subject and its allegorical meaning can be attributed to the patron, the artist, and a Belgian art biographer, Karel van Mander, whose theories entertained Rembdrant.   Van Mander's book Het schilder-boeck released a second edition in 1618.  The book was produced in Amsterdam and included details about many Netherlands painters.  Rembrandt surely would have read this book, both because of its importance and its location, and familiarized himself with van Mander's theories and interpretations of Ovid's myths.   Van Mander commented on Europa's abduction, with a European spin to it.  Ovid's account of the abduction of Europa is found in Book II 833-75 of Metamorphoses.   Europa is a princess of Tyre, who is playing with her court on the coast when a beautiful bull appears.  Europa mounts the bull, which quickly whisks her away into the ocean.  When Europa and her friends notice the bull retreating further into the sea without coming back, the bull transforms into Zeus and carries her to Mount Olympus on the island of Crete.   Rembrandt's painting is set just as Europa is whisked away, as seen by the bull and young lady in the ocean in the painting.   Art historians, like Mari\u00ebt Westermann and Gary Schwartz interpret the painting as a reference to Specx' career.  The painting includes details from Ovid's story that strengthen the location of the tale as well as tie it to Specx' life.  The African driver and non-European coach in the shadows to the right allude to the exotic Phoenician coast.  There is a port in the background, a reference to the busy port of the Tyre.  Karel van Mander looked for an applicable meaning to the work that constructed a moral concept to the classical literature.  He quoted an unnamed ancient source that stated that the abducted princess was representative of \"the human soul, borne by the body through the troubled sea of this world\".   Van Mander theorized that the bull, which is Zeus in the classical tale, is really the name of a ship that bore Europa from her eastern home of Tyre to the western continent that adopts her name.\n", "\nArtist: Rembrandt\nArtwork Name: The Storm on the Sea of Galilee\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: board,canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/christ-in-the-storm-1633\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Storm on the Sea of Galilee is a painting from 1633 by the Dutch Golden Age painter Rembrandt van Rijn that was in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of Boston, Massachusetts, United States, prior to being stolen in 1990.

It is now in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence, where the most recent restoration by Daniele Rossi revealed a signature previously hidden under old varnish.\r The Rembrandt Research Project and other modern scholars now doubt that it is by Rembrandt at all, although it might be an unfinished Rembrandt portrait taken over by another artist. Even more unlikely is that is a Rembrandt self-portrait, simply on the low level of resemblance of the face to the many certain examples. It used to be dated to about 1634, on the grounds of the age of the subject, if a self-portrait, and the lack of the moustache that Rembrandt usually has for most of the 1630s. Seen in terms of Rembrandt's style alone, about 1639-40 seems more likely.\r As in many of Rembrandt's actual self-portraits, the subject wears fanciful dress that suggests the 16th rather than the 17th century.

It was exhibited in Florence as a Rembrandt self-portrait in 1724, and so described in the published illustrated catalogue of the Gerini collection in 1759. In the Palazzo Gerini an allegory of the arts in fresco by Giuseppe Zocchi (1711\u201367) shows the personification of \"Painting\" looking at the catalogue, held by two putti, open to the page illustrating this painting. The highly unusual rendition in fresco of a reproductive print shows the prestige the painting had.

The painting is Rembrandt's attempt to establish himself as a painter of large, baroque history paintings.\r The story of Belshazzar and the writing on the wall originates in the Old Testament Book of Daniel. The Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar looted the Temple in Jerusalem and has stolen the sacred artefacts such as golden cups. His son Belshazzar used these cups for a great feast where the hand of God appeared and wrote the inscription on the wall prophesying the downfall of Belshazzar's reign.\r The inscription on the wall is an interesting element in this painting. Rembrandt lived in the Jewish Quarter of Amsterdam and \"derived the form of Hebrew inscription from a book by his friend, the learned Rabbi and printer, Menasseh ben Israel, yet mistranscribed one of the characters and arranged them in columns, rather than right to left, as Hebrew is written.\" This last detail is essential as it relates to the question of why Belshazzar and his advisers were not able to decipher the inscription and had to send for Daniel to help them with it. The biblical story does not identify the language of the cryptic message, but it is generally assumed to be Aramaic, which, like Hebrew, is written in right-to-left rows, and not in right-to-left columns as in the painting. Although there is no accepted explanation why the Babylonian priests were unable to decipher the writing, the point of this unconventional arrangement \u2013 reading the text in the painting in the conventional row-wise left-to-right order results in a garbled message \u2013 may be to suggest why the text proved incomprehensible to the Babylonian wise men; indeed, this explanation is in accordance with the opinion of the amora Shmuel, which is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin, 22 a, among various dissenting views. However, it seems unlikely that Rembrandt would have known this, as there is no evidence to suggest he was proficient in the Talmud.\r In 1834 two brothers, Frederick and Henry Worseldine were charged with having stolen the painting. Frederick,was found guilty and transported to Tasmania for life. Henry was cleared, but followed his brother a few years later. Also of note their father, John, having left their mother some time after 1841 took up with a women by the name of Martha who after his death in 1848 was murdered by her new husband William Sheward who was hanged in Norwich the case caused some notoriety. <Morning Advertiser 12 September 1834 https://search.findmypast.co.uk/bna/viewarticle?id=bl%2f0001427%2f18340912%2f020><The old bailey online- Worseldine https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/search.jsp?form=_divs&kwparse=and&_divs_fulltext=WORSELDINE&ref=&_divs_div0Type_div1Type=&submit.x=50&submit.y=-16>\r Rembrandt's handling of painting materials and his painting technique in Belshazzar's Feast are both exceptional and do not compare to any of his other works.

The Rape of Ganymede. If the picture (for the present description is taken from a print) be really by Rembrandt, his intention must have been to burlesque the mythological subject above stated, for he has represented the beautiful Ganymede as a great lubberly child, with a blubbering grimace of countenance, sprawling, with extended arms, in the talons and beak of the eagle Jupiter. The bird has seized him by his unclassical raiments, the weight of his fat body has drawn his clothes up to his shoulders, and left his lower extremities in a state of nudity, and is thus bearing him through the murky air to Olympus. Engraved by A. Cardon. 6 ft. 3 in. by 2 ft. 8 in.\u2014C. Now in the Dresden Gallery.\"\r The answer to this puzzle lies in the preliminary sketch for this painting, where Rembrandt has even sketched the child defecating instead of urinating, with what appear to be two horrified parents raising their arms below. The painting has done away with these figures and keeps the lower portion of the earthly world in utter darkness and despair, while the eagle is taking the child (against its will) towards the light. Rembrandt's depiction of the reluctant Ganymede should be seen not in the Renaissance context of the homo-erotic catamite theme, but in a relatively new Protestant Baroque interpretation of Ganymede as a beloved child \"abducted from life too soon\". In the 1670s the painter Nicolaes Maes even made a whole series of paintings of Ganymedes that are considered deathbed portraits of children.\n", "\nArtist: Rembrandt\nArtwork Name: The Blinding of Samson\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/the-blinding-of-samson-1636\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Blinding of Samson is a 1636 painting by Rembrandt, now in the St\u00e4del.

The identity of the subject of the painting is unclear, and has given rise to several different interpretations. The view that the figure's dress is clearly Polish is not universally held and it may have been a self-portrait.\r The painting has changed owners several times, and its past owners have included Catherine II the Great and Andrew Mellon. It is currently located at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\r The portrait represents a man, estimated by some to be 45\u00a0years of age, standing turned to the viewer's right, looking at the viewer with a commanding expression. In his uplifted right hand he holds a baton with a golden cap. He has a thick moustache and wears a high fur cap on which there is a golden chain with precious stones and a coat of arms in the center. From his ear a large pear-shaped pearl hangs from a golden pendant earring. He wears a reddish-brown mantle with a broad fur collar and, over it, a heavy gold chain from which the order of three horse tails, set in rich pendants, hangs on his right shoulder. A full light from the left falls on the right side of his face. The background is brownish-grey.\r The painting was created by Rembrandt in 1637. It was not given an official title. The current one is the most recent, widely accepted one. Prior and alternate names include Portrait of a Slav Prince, Portrait d'un Turc, and Man in Russian Costume. Its authenticity was supported by an analysis of the panel's wood, which showed that it was cut from a tree felled around 1635 that was also used in the painter's River Landscape with Ruins (1650). The painting underwent restoration in 1985 and has been X-rayed.\r The painting's first owner or owners are not clear, but it might have been owned by a certain Harman van Swole. It was purchased in 1768 by Catherine II the Great and held in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. It was purchased by Andrew Mellon in 1931, and given by the Mellon Trust to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1937. The painting was one of a number of artworks that Mellon had purchased from the Hermitage during the 1930s. He denied having made these purchases for several years, since the US was in a major depression \u2014 which would have made the acquisitions seem extravagant \u2014 and at odds with the Soviet government. The works were kept for some time in a non-public section of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\r This work was labeled by some art critics as a tronie, a painting with an exaggerated facial expression or a stock character in costume. For instance, Melissa Percival notes that in this particular painting the viewer may notice an extravagant fur cape, lopsided hat, tufted mustache, and similar paraphernalia, all giving \"an impression that the painting should not be taken too seriously\".\n", "\nArtist: Rembrandt\nArtwork Name: The Stone Bridge\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/the-stone-bridge\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Stone Bridge is a 1637 landscape painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Rembrandt in the collection of the Rijksmuseum.\r This painting was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1915, who wrote: \"939.

In this case specific influences in the pose have long been recognised from Raphael's Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione (now Louvre) and Titian's A Man with a Quilted Sleeve (in 2017 called Portrait of Gerolamo?

It is in the collection of the Amsterdam Museum but is prominently displayed in the Rijksmuseum as the best known painting in its collection. The Night Watch is one of the most famous Dutch Golden Age paintings.\r The painting is famous for three things: its colossal size (363\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a0437\u00a0cm (11.91\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a014.34\u00a0ft)), the dramatic use of light and shadow (tenebrism) and the perception of motion in what would have traditionally been a static military group portrait. The painting was completed in 1642, at the peak of the Dutch Golden Age. It depicts the eponymous company moving out, led by Captain Frans Banning Cocq (dressed in black, with a red sash) and his lieutenant, Willem van Ruytenburch (dressed in yellow, with a white sash). With effective use of sunlight and shade, Rembrandt leads the eye to the three most important characters among the crowd: the two gentlemen in the centre (from whom the painting gets its original title), and the woman in the centre-left background carrying a chicken. Behind them, the company's colours are carried by the ensign, Jan Visscher Cornelissen. The figures are almost life-size.\r Rembrandt has displayed the traditional emblem of the arquebusiers in a natural way, with the woman in the background carrying the main symbols. She is a kind of mascot herself; the claws of a dead chicken on her belt represent the clauweniers (arquebusiers), the pistol behind the chicken represents clover and she is holding the militia's goblet. The man in front of her is wearing a helmet with an oak leaf, a traditional motif of the arquebusiers. The dead chicken is also meant to represent a defeated adversary. The colour yellow is often associated with victory.\r For much of its existence, the painting was coated with a dark varnish, which gave the incorrect impression that it depicted a night scene, leading to the name by which it is now commonly known. This varnish was removed only in the 1940s.\r In 1715, upon its removal from the Kloveniersdoelen to the Amsterdam Town Hall, the painting was trimmed on all four sides. This was done, presumably, to fit the painting between two columns and was a common practice before the 19th century. This alteration resulted in the loss of two characters on the left side of the painting, the top of the arch, the balustrade, and the edge of the step. This balustrade and step were key visual tools used by Rembrandt to give the painting a forward motion. A 17th-century copy of the painting by Gerrit Lundens at the National Gallery, London shows the original composition.\r The painting was commissioned (around 1639) by Captain Banning Cocq and seventeen members of his Kloveniers (civic militia guards). Eighteen names appear on a shield, painted circa 1715, in the centre right background, as the hired drummer was added to the painting for free. A total of 34 characters appear in the painting. Rembrandt was paid 1,600 guilders for the painting (each person paid one hundred), a large sum at the time. This was one of a series of seven similar paintings of the militiamen (Dutch: Schuttersstuk) commissioned during that time from various artists.\n", "\nArtist: Rembrandt\nArtwork Name: Danae\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/danae-1643\n\nWikipedia Article:\nDana\u00eb is a 1636 painting by the Dutch artist Rembrandt.

It is a life-sized depiction of the character Dana\u00eb from Greek mythology, the mother of Perseus. She is presumably depicted as welcoming Zeus, who impregnated her in the form of a shower of gold. Given that this is one of Rembrandt's most magnificent paintings, it is not out of the question that he cherished it, but it also may have been difficult to sell because of its eight-by-ten-foot size. Although the artist's wife Saskia was the original model for Dana\u00eb, Rembrandt later changed the figure's face to that of his mistress Geertje Dircx.\r On June 15, 1985 Rembrandt's painting was attacked by Bronius Maigys\u00a0(lt), a Soviet Lithuanian national later judged insane; he threw sulfuric acid on the canvas and cut it twice with his knife. The entire central part of the composition was turned into a mixture of spots with a conglomerate of splashes and areas of dripping paint. The worst damage was to the face and hair of Dana\u00eb, her right arm, and legs.\r The process of restoring the painting began the same day. Following consultations with chemists, art restorers began washing the surface of the painting with water; they kept the painting in the vertical position, and sprayed water at the painting to prevent further degradation of the painting.\r The restoration of the painting was accomplished between 1985 and 1997 by staff of the State Hermitage's Laboratory of Expert Restoration of Easel Paintings: Ye.

In this scene, a few Jews, mainly Scribes and Pharisees, tried to catch Jesus condoning disobedience to the Jewish Law, knowing that Jesus pitied wrong-doers. To do this, they produced a woman who had been caught taking part in adultery. Then, they said \"Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery.

In contrast, the Jews are \"in the dark\" and appear lower. Symbolically, Jesus's height represents his moral superiority over those who attempted to trick him.\r The painting was investigated by the scientists of the National Gallery London.

Categorized as a work by Rembrandt for many years, doubts were expressed as to its provenance in 1984 by a Dutch curators' commission specifically created to investigate Rembrandt works of questionable authenticity.  They made their remarks whilst viewing the painting in West Berlin.  In November 1985, Berlin-based art expert Jan Kelch announced that important details in the painting's style did not match the style of Rembrandt's known works, and that the painting was probably painted in 1650 by one of Rembrandt's students.  \"It is not a fake,\" Kelch averred.  \"It remains a great masterful work.\"  The Man with the Golden Helmet is an example of Dutch Golden Age painting and is now in the collection of the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin.

It is now in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie in Berlin.\r There are multiple versions of Rembrandt's Head of Christ which compose an international collection of paintings in the possession of a number of different cultural institutions and individuals. These similar heads in varying poses were possibly created as devotional objects. Today about a dozen are known, but only this one is considered by the RRP to be by the master's hand. This one came into the collection via a bequest by Herr and Frau Martin Bromberg of Hamburg.\r This painting was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1914, who wrote; \"158. HEAD OF CHRIST.

This has variously been interpreted as the man of sound, methodical science deferring to Art, or as the wealthy and famous philosopher, wearing the jeweled belt given to him by Alexander the Great, envying the life of the poor blind bard. It has also been suggested that this is Rembrandt's commentary on the power of portraiture.\r The interpretation of methodical science deferring to art is discussed at length in Rembrandt's Aristotle and Other Rembrandt Studies. The author notes that Aristotle's right hand (traditionally the favored hand), which rests on the bust of Homer, is both higher and painted in lighter shades than the left hand on the gold chain given to him by Alexander.\r The exact subject being portrayed in this portrait has been challenged in the book by Simon Schama titled Rembrandt's Eyes, applying the scholarship of Paul Crenshaw. Schama presents a substantial argument that it was the famous ancient Greek painter Apelles who is depicted in contemplation by Rembrandt and not Aristotle.\r It was purchased in 1961 for $2.3 million by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, USA. At the time this was the highest amount ever paid for any picture at public or private sale. During the renovation of the Rembrandt wing of the Metropolitan Museum, the painting was retitled in November 2013 as Aristotle with a Bust of Homer.\r The painting forms the central theme of Joseph Heller's 1988 novel Picture This.\n", "\nArtist: Rembrandt\nArtwork Name: Bathsheba at Her Bath (Bathsheba Holding King David's Letter)\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/bathsheba-bathing-1654\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBathsheba at Her Bath (or Bathsheba with King David's Letter) is an oil painting by the Dutch artist Rembrandt (1606\u20131669) finished in 1654.\r A depiction that is both sensual and empathetic, it shows a moment from the Old Testament story in which King David sees Bathsheba bathing and, entranced, seduces and impregnates her. In order to marry Bathsheba and conceal his sin, David sends her husband into battle and orders his generals to abandon him, leaving him to certain death.\r While the scene of David spying on Bathsheba had been painted by earlier artists, Rembrandt's depiction differs in its tight pictorial focus and erotic vitality, achieved through broad, thick brushstrokes and vibrant coloration.\r The painting hangs in The Louvre; it is one of 583 works donated by Dr. Louis La Caze in 1869. For Kenneth Clark, the canvas is \"Rembrandt's greatest painting of the nude\". Its insight into Bathsheba's moral dilemma has been described as \"one of the great achievements of western painting.\"\r The Second Book of Samuel (11:2-4) gives the account of King David who saw a woman bathing from his palace roof. When he asked after her, he was told that she was Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam and wife of Uriah the Hittite. David had his messengers retrieve her, and after they slept together she became pregnant with his child. David was able to marry Bathsheba by sending Uriah into battle where he was killed.\r Prior to Bathsheba at Her Bath, the standard treatment had been to show Bathsheba bathing out of doors\u2014thus accounting for her visibility to David\u2014and accompanied by maidservants. A tower could usually be seen in the distance, and perhaps a small figure of David, sometimes accompanied by his two courtiers. Such was the design Rembrandt's earlier The Toilet of Bathsheba, dated 1643. By eliminating David, his messengers and most of the traditional narrative elements from the picture\u2014the only anecdotal references included are the letter from David (not actually mentioned in Samuel) and the presence of an attendant drying her foot\u2014Rembrandt's presentation of Bathsheba is both intimate and monumental. As a result, the moralistic theme of previous treatments of the subject is replaced by a direct eroticism in which the viewer supplants David as voyeur.\r The work is painted as life sized and in a shallow space, with Bathsheba dominating the composition as she had in no other earlier version of the scene. It is not known whether Rembrandt painted Bathsheba for his own reasons, or to satisfy a commission. Presumably in response to Rembrandt's painting, his ex-pupil and close associate Willem Drost painted Bathsheba with David's Letter the same year, which is also in the Louvre.\r Apart from the lack of anecdotal devices, the painting is unusual in other ways. Bathsheba is presented in a space that is difficult to read. The dark background is suggestive of night, while a massive column implies a large architectural structure. Behind her lies a passage of richly painted drapery composed of browns and ochers that impart a golden warmth. Around her rests a thickly painted background of white chemise; set against this her naked flesh stands out for its solid form and the sumptuous application of paint. The paint used to describe her figure is richly nuanced, its broad brushstrokes and strong highlights impart a vibrant tactile quality to the body, rendering her presence palpable.\n", "\nArtist: Rembrandt\nArtwork Name: The Polish Rider\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/the-polish-rider-1655\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Polish Rider is a seventeenth-century painting, usually dated to the 1650s, of a young man traveling on horseback through a murky landscape, now in The Frick Collection in New York. When the painting was sold by Zdzis\u0142aw Tarnowski\u00a0(pl) to Henry Frick in 1910, there was consensus that the work was by the Dutch painter Rembrandt. This attribution has since been contested, though this remains a minority view.\r There has also been debate over whether the painting was intended as a portrait of a particular person, living or historical, and if so of whom, or if not, what it was intended to represent. Both the quality of the painting and its slight air of mystery are commonly recognized, though parts of the background are very sketchily painted or unfinished.\r The first western scholar to discuss the painting was Wilhelm von Bode who in his History of Dutch Painting (1883) stated that it was a Rembrandt dating from his \"late\" period, that is, 1654. Somewhat later, Abraham Bredius examined the picture quite closely and had no doubts that its author was Rembrandt. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Alfred von Wurzbach suggested that Rembrandt's student Aert de Gelder might have been the author, but his opinion was generally disregarded. Throughout most of the twentieth century, there was general agreement that the painting was indeed by Rembrandt and even Julius S. Held, who at one time questioned its Polish connection, never doubted Rembrandt's authorship. However, in 1984, Josua Bruyn, then a member of the Rembrandt Research Project (RRP) tentatively suggested that certain characteristics of the work of Willem Drost, another student of Rembrandt, could be observed in the painting. Though the mysterious and somewhat solemn expression on the Rider's brilliantly painted face point to Rembrandt,The Polish Rider is unlike Rembrandt's other work in certain other ways. In particular, Rembrandt rarely worked on equestrian paintings, the only other known equestrian portrait in Rembrandt's work being the Portrait of Frederick Rihel, 1663 (National Gallery, London).\r But Bruyn's remained a minority opinion, the suggestion of Drost's authorship is now generally rejected, and the Frick itself never changed its own attribution, the label still reading \"Rembrandt\" and not \"attributed to\" or \"school of\". More recent opinion has shifted even more decisively in favor of the Frick, with Simon Schama in his 1999 book Rembrandt's Eyes, and scholar Ernst van de Wetering, chair of the Rembrandt Project (Melbourne Symposium, 1997), both arguing for attribution to the master. Those few scholars who still question Rembrandt's authorship feel that the execution is uneven, and favour different attributions for different parts of the work. A 1998 study published by the RRP concluded that another artist's hand, besides that of Rembrandt, was involved in the work. Rembrandt may have started the painting in the 1650s, but perhaps he left it unfinished and it may have been completed by someone else.\r The idealised, inscrutable character has encouraged various theories about its subject, if the picture is a portrait. Candidates have included an ancestor of the Polish-Lithuanian Oginski family Marcjan Aleksander Ogi\u0144ski, as asserted by the 18th-century owners of the painting and the Polish theologian, Jonasz Szlichtyng. Others believe that the outfit of the rider, the weapons and even the breed of horse are all Polish. Dutch equestrian portraits were infrequent in the 17th century and traditionally showed a fashionably dressed rider on a well-bred, spirited horse, as in Rembrandt's Frederick Rihel.\n", "\nArtist: Rembrandt\nArtwork Name: The Carcass of an Ox (Slaughtered Ox)\nArtwork Genre: still life\nArtwork Media: board,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/the-carcass-of-an-ox-slaughtered-ox-1655\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSlaughtered Ox, also known as Flayed Ox, Side of Beef, or Carcass of Beef, is a 1655 oil on beech panel still life painting by Rembrandt. It has been in the collection of the Louvre in Paris since 1857. A similar painting is in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, possibly by Rembrandt himself but probably by one of his pupils, perhaps Fabritius. Other similar, paintings attributed to Rembrandt or his circle, are held by museums in Budapest and Philadelphia.\r The work follows in a tradition of artworks showing butchery, for example Pieter Aertsen's A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms (1551) and Annibale Carracci's Butcher's Shop (c.1583), and perhaps more specifically Joachim Beuckelaer's Slaughtered Pig (1563) or . Rembrandt made a drawing of a similar scene c.1635. Another, pre-1655, painting of a slaughtered ox (the example in Edinburgh, now attributed to Rembrandt's circle but formerly to Rembrandt) was perhaps inspired by a lost earlier work by Rembrandt himself. In northern Europe, the month of November was traditionally the season slaughtering livestock in northern Europe, before winter made feed difficult to find.\r The still life painting measures 95.5 by 68.8 centimetres (37.6\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a027.1\u00a0in), and is signed and dated \"Rembrandt f. 1655\". It shows a butchered carcass of a large bovine, a bull or an ox, hanging in a wooden building, possibly a stable or lean-to shed. The carcass is suspended by its two rear legs, which are tied by ropes to a wooden crossbeam. The animal has been decapitated and flayed of skin and hair, the chest cavity has been stretched open and the internal organs removed, revealing a mass of flesh, fat, connective tissue, joints, bones, and ribs. The carcass is carefully coloured, and given textures by impasto. In the background, a woman's head and body of a woman appear at a door, lifting the painting from still life into a genre painting, a scene of normal everyday life. It is sometimes considered a vanitas or memento mori; some commentators make references to the killing of the fatted calf in the biblical story of the Prodigal Son, others directly to the Crucifixion of Jesus.\r The painting was possibly owned by Christoffel Hirschvogel in 1661. It was viewed by Joshua Reynolds in the collection of Pieter Locquet in Amsterdam in 1781, and later owned by Louis Viardot, who sold it to the Louvre in 1857 for 5,000 francs.\r The work's muscular meatiness inspired a series of works the French painter Chaim Soutine, and in turn the English painter Francis Bacon, most particularly Bacon's Figure with Meat, in which be depicts Pope Innocent X, as painted by Velazquez, accompanied by ghostly echoes of the carcass from Rembrandt's painting.\n", "\nArtist: Rembrandt\nArtwork Name: Anatomy of Doctor Deyman\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/anatomy-of-doctor-deyman-1656\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Deijman (alternative spelling Deyman) is a 1656, fragmentary painting by Rembrandt, now in Amsterdam Museum.

Dr. Deijman's assistant, the surgeon Gijsbert Calkoen (1621-1664), is seen on the left, holding the top of the dead man's skull.\r The perspective of the corpse is depicted with exaggerated foreshortening to give the viewer a sense of standing in front of the dissection table, similar to the foreshortening in Mantegna's Lamentation of Christ, which Rembrandt would have been familiar with through prints.\n", "\nArtist: Rembrandt\nArtwork Name: Jacob Blessing the Children of Joseph\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/jacob-blessing-the-children-of-joseph-1656\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph is a 1656 oil painting by Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn. It is said to have almost \u201ca sculptural surface with a translucent glaze over paint\u201d. This piece is housed in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister in Kassel, Germany.\r Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph shows a scene from the Old Testament book of Genesis, Chapter 48. In this scene, Joseph brings his two sons (Manasseh and Ephraim) to his dying father Jacob so that they can receive the family blessing. According to tradition, the eldest son is blessed with the patriarch\u2019s right hand. However, Jacob deliberately crossed his arms and put his right hand on Ephraim\u2019s (the younger son\u2019s) head and his left hand on Manasseh\u2019s (the oldest son\u2019s) head. Joseph was displeased and thought that his father was making a mistake. When Joseph tried to correct his father, Jacob refused and told Joseph that he was purposefully blessing the younger son.\r This painting only shows the blessing of Ephraim. The arms aren\u2019t crossed and Manasseh isn\u2019t being blessed simultaneously, as the text implies. In addition, Rembrandt omits the argument between Joseph and Jacob. In fact, the tenderness and warmth of the familial interaction seems to suggest that the blessing of the younger son was the original intention. Lastly, Rembrandt included the mother of the children, Asenath.\r Asenath was the daughter of an Egyptian priest. According to chapter 41 in the book of Genesis, she was given to Joseph by the pharaoh, himself. The purpose of adding Asenath to the painting is unknown. However, some think that Rembrandt was incorporating 17th century Dutch culture into the painting. Dutch wives were beginning to be viewed more as colleague to their husbands. With this mindset, it would only be logical that Asenath would be present at such an important event as the blessing of her children.\r Rembrandt is famous for his use of light and shadow (Chiaroscuro) and Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph is not an exception to the rule. This draws attention to the main characters of Jacob, Joseph, Ephraim, Manasseh, and Asenath while obscuring the background. In particular, there seems to be a halo surrounding Ephraim as he is being blessed. Also notable is the prominent colors that Rembrandt used. The yellows, browns, and reds give the painting a mood that is \u201cboth intimate and sacred, tender and solemn\u201d.\n", "\nArtist: Rembrandt\nArtwork Name: Self-portrait\nArtwork Genre: self-portrait\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/self-portrait-1658\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Self Portrait is a 1658 self portrait by Rembrandt, one of over 40 self-portraits by Rembrandt.

The origin of the painting can be traced back to 1662, two years after its completion.\r The subject is an episode from chapters 5-7 of the book of Esther in the Old Testament. Haman, counciller to the king Ahasuerus, proposed to hang Mordechai for not paying him respect by standing as he entered the room or by greeting him, and the entire Jewish nation as revenge for their pride. The Jews were saved by the intercession of Mordechai's cousin Esther, who was also Ahasuerus' wife. It is this rescue that is still celebrated in the Jewish festival of Purim. In that festival, Haman is portrayed as the villain, and this is reflected in Rembrandt's depiction of him.\r According to the Pushkin Museum this is one of the best creations of Rembrandt's late period.\r Rembrandt was inspired by the play Hester, by Johannes Serwouters (1623-1677), when painting \"Ahasuerus and Haman at the feast of Esther\". The playwright was first performed in 1659 in the Schouwburg of Van Campen and dedicated to Leonore Huydecoper, the daughter of Joan Huydecoper van Maarsseveen. Serwouters wrote his play as a reaction to the pogroms in Eastern Europe. Her husband may have ordered the painting, in this way helping Rembrandt being in financial difficulties.\r After its completion in 1660, Rembrandt sold the painting Ahasuerus and Haman at the feast of Esther to Jan J. Hinlopen. In the year 1662 a poetry book by Jan Vos was published, in which there were a number of poems based on the paintings belonging to Jan J. Hinlopen. Jan Vos describes the painting as following:\r Part of Jan Hinlopen's collection passed to his two daughters, this painting was one of them. Sara Hinlopen, the longest living of her family, died 89 years old, but without children. Most of her belongings passed to Nicolaes Geelvinck and his three sisters. Unfortunately, her will does not mention any painting, most probably to avoid inheritance taxes.\r In 1760 Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther was sold as number 45 at an auction, listed as coming from Nicolaes Geelvinck, and organized after the death of Gerard Hoet, a minor painter but important collector in The Hague.\r In 1764 the painting came to Catherine the Great, most probably through the German entrepreneur Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky, in financial trouble after the Seven Years' War. After receiving 320 paintings at one time from Gotzkowsky, the Russian Tsarina started the Hermitage.\r Probably advised by Gustav Friedrich Waagen the painting went in 1862 to the Museum Rumyantsev in Moscow.

The painting was commissioned by the Amsterdam city council for the Town Hall. After the work had been in place briefly, it was returned to Rembrandt, who may have never been paid. Rembrandt drastically cut down the painting to a quarter of the original size to be sold. It is the last secular history painting he finished.\r The painting follows Tacitus's Histories in depicting an episode from the Batavian rebellion (69\u201370 AD), led by the one-eyed chieftain Claudius Civilis (actually called Gaius Julius Civilis by Tacitus, except once, and so known to history; but Claudius Civilis has become entrenched in art history), in which he \"collected at one of the sacred groves, ostensibly for a banquet, the chiefs of the nation and the boldest spirits of the lower class\", convinced them to join his rebellion, and then \"bound the whole assembly with barbarous rites and strange forms of oath.\"\r Civilis, Tacitus writes, \"was unusually intelligent for a native, and passed himself off as a second Sertorius or Hannibal, whose facial disfigurement he shared\"\u2014that is to say, the loss of one eye. He feigned friendship with Emperor Vespasian in order to regain his freedom. When he returned to his tribal grounds in the marshes of the Betuwe, he organized the revolt he had long been planning.\r The painting was commissioned for the gallery of the new city hall on the Dam, finished in 1655 (now the Royal Palace). History paintings were regarded as the highest in the hierarchy of genres in the 17th century (a view Rembrandt shared), and the Batavian revolt was regarded, and romanticised, as a precursor of the recently ended war against the Spanish. In 1659, when John Maurice of Nassau, Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, her two daughters and two daughters-in-law came to see the new building, the council commissioned twelve paintings from Rembrandt's ex-pupil Govert Flinck to fill all the large spaces using a programme drawn up by the poet Joost van den Vondel, but Flink died in 1660 before completing any of the works. The work was then shared out by the burgomasters Joan Huydecoper and Andries de Graeff, who were certainly decisive, between a number of painters including Jacob Jordaens and Jan Lievens. The council provided the canvas to the artist. Rembrandt was commissioned to do the scene from Tacitus, one of eight intended to cover the revolt in the original scheme.\r The sword-oath was invented by Rembrandt. There is one sword more in the painting \u2013 the one touching the front of the leader's blade \u2013 than Batavians holding them; other depictions of the event show handshakes, especially that engraved in 1612 by Antonio Tempesta as one of a set of thirty-six illustrations to designs by Otto van Veen in the book Batavorum cum Romanis bellum on the revolt. In the following year, the States General had commissioned a set of twelve paintings by Van Veen on the same subject for The Hague. These baroque works had entered the popular imagination as depictions of the revolt, and Flinck's design drew on the engraving of this scene.

This interpretation is no longer accepted, and the identity of the couple is uncertain. The ambiguity is heightened by the lack of anecdotal context, leaving only the central universal theme, that of a couple joined in love. Speculative suggestions as to the couple's identity have ranged from Rembrandt's son Titus and his bride, or Amsterdam poet Miguel de Barrios and his wife. Also considered are several couples from the Old Testament, including Abraham and Sarah, Boaz and Ruth, or Isaac and Rebekah, which is supported by a drawing by the artist several years prior.\r While technical evidence suggests that Rembrandt initially envisioned a larger and more elaborate composition, the placement of his signature at lower left indicates that its current dimensions are not significantly different from those at the time of its completion. According to Rembrandt biographer Christopher White, the completed composition is \"one of the greatest expressions of the tender fusion of spiritual and physical love in the history of painting.\"\r The painting is in the permanent collection of the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.\n", "\nArtist: Rembrandt\nArtwork Name: Self-portrait in at the Age of 63\nArtwork Genre: self-portrait,tronie\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/self-portrait-in-at-the-age-of-63-1669\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSelf-Portrait at the Age of 63 is a self-portrait by the Dutch artist Rembrandt, now in the National Gallery, London.

It is among the Dutch master's final works, likely completed within two years of his death in 1669. Depicting the moment of the prodigal son's return to his father in the Biblical parable, it is a renowned work described by art historian Kenneth Clark as \"a picture which those who have seen the original in St. Petersburg may be forgiven for claiming as the greatest picture ever painted\".\r In the painting, the son has returned home in a wretched state from travels in which he has wasted his inheritance and fallen into poverty and despair. He kneels before his father in repentance, wishing for forgiveness and a renewed place in the family, having realized that even his father's servants had a better station in life than he. His father receives him with a tender gesture. His hands seem to suggest mothering and fathering at once; the left appears larger and more masculine, set on the son's shoulder, while the right is softer and more receptive in gesture. Standing at the right is the prodigal son's older brother, who crosses his hands in judgment; in the parable he objects to the father's compassion for the sinful son:\r The father explains, \"But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found\" (Luke 15:32).\r Rembrandt was moved by the parable, and he made a variety of drawings, etchings, and paintings on the theme that spanned decades, beginning with a 1636 etching (see Gallery). The Return of the Prodigal Son includes figures not directly related to the parable but seen in some of these earlier works; their identities have been debated. The woman at top left, barely visible, is likely the mother, while the seated man, whose dress implies wealth, may be an advisor to the estate or a tax collector. The standing man at centre is likely the elder son. .\r The Return of the Prodigal Son demonstrates the mastery of the late Rembrandt. His evocation of spirituality and the parable's message of forgiveness has been considered the height of his art. Rembrandt scholar Rosenberg (et al.) calls the painting \"monumental\", writing that Rembrandt\r Art historian H. W. Janson writes that Prodigal Son \"may be [Rembrandt's] most moving painting. It is also his quietest\u2014a moment stretching into eternity. So pervasive is the mood of tender silence that the viewer feels a kinship with this group. That bond is perhaps stronger and more intimate in this picture than in any earlier work of art.\"\r Dutch priest Henri Nouwen (1932\u20131996) was so taken by the painting that he eventually wrote a short book, The Return of the Prodigal Son: A Story of Homecoming (1992), using the parable and Rembrandt's painting as frameworks. He begins by describing his visit to the State Hermitage Museum in 1986, where he was able to contemplate the painting alone for hours.

It was attributed for centuries to Frans Hals until Wilhelm von Bode saw it in the Six collection in 1883. He noticed the prominent \"J\" in the signature, and attributed it to Jan Hals. This is one of seven paintings first properly attributed to Leyster by Hofstede de Groot ten years later in 1893.\r Originally in the collection of the Amsterdam art collector Pieter van Winter (1745-1807), the painting came into the Six collection through his daughter's marriage to Hendrik Six van Hillegom. A mezzotint of this painting was made for Van Winter in 1803 by Frederik Christiaan Bierweiler and inscribed \"F. Hals pinxit ... F.C. Bierweiler fecit 1803\".\r After it was attributed to Leyster, the Rijksmuseum purchased the paintings from the Six heirs of Jhr. P.H. Six van Vromade together with 38 other paintings with support from the Vereniging Rembrandt in 1908.

It depicts a woman, sewing by candlelight, as a man leans over her, touching her right shoulder with his left hand. He is offering her coins in his right hand, but she is apparently ignoring the offer and concentrating intently upon her sewing.\r The man wears dark clothing, and the dark tones as well as his shadow cast behind him and across his face from the angle of the candlelight give him a looming appearance. In contrast, the woman is lit fully in the face by the candlelight, and wears a white blouse. It is an early work by Leyster, who was only 22 years old in 1631.\r Meg Lota Brown, professor of English at the University of Arizona, and Kari Boyd McBride, professor of Women's Studies at the same, consider The Proposition to be \"one of [Leyster's] most intriguing works from her period of greatest artistic output\". Marianne Berardi, an art historian specializing in Dutch Golden Age painting, states that it is \"perhaps her most notable painting\". Its most distinctive feature is how different it is to other contemporary Dutch and Fleming \"sexual proposition\" paintings, many falling into the Merry company genre. The convention for the genre, a common one at the time, was for the characters to be bawdy, and clearly both interested in sex, for money. The dress would be provocative, the facial expressions suggestive, and sometimes there would be a third figure of an older woman acting as a procuress. Indeed, in The Procuress by Dirck van Baburen, an example of the genre, that is exactly the case.\r In contrast, in The Proposition the woman is depicted not as a whore but as an ordinary housewife, engaged in a simple everyday domestic chore. She isn't dressed provocatively. She does not display her bosom (but rather her blouse covers her all of the way to her neck). No ankles are visible. And she displays no interest in sex or even in the man at all. Contemporary Dutch literature stated the sort of activity in which she is engaged to be the proper behaviour for virtuous women in idle moments. Kirstin Olsen observed that male art critics \"so completely missed the point\" that the woman is, in contrast to other works, not welcoming the man's proposition that they mistakenly named the painting The Tempting Offer.\r The foot warmer, whose glowing coals are visible beneath the hem of the woman's skirt, was a pictorial code of the time, and represented the woman's marital status. A foot warmer wholly under the skirt indicated a married woman who was unavailable, as it does in The Proposition; a foot warmer projecting halfway out from under the skirt with the woman's foot visible on it indicated one who might be receptive to a male suitor; and a foot warmer that is not under the woman at all, and empty of coals, indicated a single woman. This code can also be seen in Vermeer's The Milkmaid and Dou's The Young Mother.\n", "\nArtist: Jan Miense Molenaer\nArtwork Name: Woman Playing the Virginal\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-miense-molenaer/woman-playing-the-virginal-1640\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe virginals or virginal is a keyboard instrument of the harpsichord family. It was popular in Europe during the late Renaissance and early baroque periods.\r A virginal is a smaller and simpler rectangular form of the harpsichord with only one string per note running more or less parallel to the keyboard on the long side of the case. Many, if not most, of the instruments were constructed without legs, and would be placed on a table for playing. Later models were built with their own stands.\r The mechanism of the virginals is identical to the harpsichord's, in that its wire strings are plucked by plectra mounted in jacks. Its case, however, is rectangular, and the single choir of strings\u2014one per note\u2014runs roughly parallel to the keyboard. The strings are plucked either at one end, as with the harpsichord, or, in the case of the muselar, nearer the middle, producing a richer, flute-like tone.\r The origin of the name is obscure. It may derive from the Latin virga meaning a rod, perhaps referring to the wooden jacks that rest on the ends of the keys, but this is unproven. Another possibility is that the name derives from the word virgin, as it was most commonly played by young women, or from its sound, which is like a young girl's voice (vox virginalis). A further view is that the name derives from the Virgin Mary as it was used by nuns to accompany hymns in honour of the Virgin.\r In England, during the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, any stringed keyboard instrument was often described as a virginals, and could equally apply to a harpsichord or possibly even a clavichord or spinet. Thus, the masterworks of William Byrd and his contemporaries were often played on full-size, Italian or Flemish harpsichords, and not only on the virginals as we call it today. Contemporary nomenclature often referred to a pair of virginals, which implied a single instrument, possibly a harpsichord with two registers, or a double virginals (see below).\r Like the harpsichord, the virginals has its origins in the medieval psaltery to which a keyboard was applied, probably in the 15th century. The first mention of the word is in Paulus Paulirinus of Prague's (1413\u20131471) Tractatus de musica of around 1460 where he writes: The virginal is an instrument in the shape of a clavichord, having metal strings which give it the timbre of a clavicembalo. It has 32 courses of strings set in motion by striking the fingers on projecting keys, giving a dulcet tone in both whole and half steps. It is called a virginal because, like a virgin, it sounds with a gentle and undisturbed voice. The OED records its first mention in English in 1530, when King Henry VIII purchased five instruments so named. Small early virginals were played either in the lap, or more commonly, rested on a table, but nearly all later examples were provided with their own stands.\r The heyday of the virginals was the latter half of the 16th century to the later 17th century until the high baroque period when it was eclipsed in England by the bentside spinet and in Germany by the clavichord.\n", "\nArtist: Gerard Terborch\nArtwork Name: Gallant Conversation (The Paternal Admonition)\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerard-terborch/gallant-conversation-the-paternal-admonition\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Gallant Conversation is an oil-on-canvas painting from circa 1654 by Gerard ter Borch (the Younger). A late 18th century French print of the work is titled The Paternal Admonition, apparently believing it showed a father reprimanding his daughter, but modern art historians see it as a conversation between two prospective lovers, either a discussion of a betrothal or, more likely, a customer propositioning a prostitute in a brothel.\r The painting shows a man talking to a young woman. The woman is dressed in an exquisite silver satin gown which immediately draws the viewer's attention to her as the focus of the scene, while the man is in military dress and holds a finely decorated hat on his lap. Next to the man sits an older woman drinking wine, seemingly uninterested in the conversation between the man and the girl. To the side of the girl is a table with a burning candle, mirror, powder puff, combs and a trailing ribbon. Behind the man's chair, a scruffy dog can be seen, and to the rear of the picture is a large bed.\r During the 19th and early 20th centuries viewers believed the scene showed the father of the girl addressing her on the subject of some misdemeanour, while her mother sat patiently beside him, sipping a glass of wine. There were several problems with this interpretation though, and later appraisals focused on the interaction between the man and the girl as potential lovers rather than as father and daughter. The figure formerly identified as the father, who is clearly a soldier, and had appeared too young to be the father of the girl and the husband of the elderly woman, fitted more easily in the role of suitor. Both a formal situation, in which the man is discussing betrothal to the attentive girl, and a transaction in a brothel have been suggested as the subject. The details in the painting are ambiguous enough for Ter Borch to have left it to the viewer to decide which of these scenes was being portrayed.\r Ter Borch made a number of copies of the work, and when a smaller version held in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie in Berlin was cleaned, it was revealed that the man was holding a coin between the fingers of his raised hand; it has been suggested that this makes the brothel scene more likely to be the correct interpretation since it is harder to reconcile the showing of money in a formal situation. However, many of the details of the painting can be placed equally well in either situation. The old woman can be viewed as either the girl's procuress or her attentive mother. The fine dress of the girl and the attention she has paid to her appearance, witnessed by the articles on the table, could be to attract a customer or equally, to secure a husband. The dog behind the chair is reminiscent of many similar depictions of domestic scenes of the time, but here it is a scruffy cur rather than a pampered spaniel. Nevertheless, the stiff upright pose of the girl is more suggestive of a formal setting than of the louche atmosphere of a brothel. The painting hints at the underlying sensuality, with the large bed looming over the scene, the accoutrements of female beauty on the table, and the abundant feathers in the soldier's cap, but this does not rule out a formal scene, as Ter Borch's contemporaries would have been aware of the ultimate similarities between the two situations. The appearance of the bed close by is not necessarily indicative of a brothel scene either: in the 17th century the bed would have been an expensive piece of furniture to be shown off in the best room. The room is sparsely furnished apart from the bed, chairs and table though, so there is little clue as to the location to be derived from the furniture.\n", "\nArtist: Carel Fabritius\nArtwork Name: The Goldfinch\nArtwork Genre: animal painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/carel-fabritius/the-goldfinch-1654\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Goldfinch (Dutch: Het puttertje) is a 1654 animal painting by Carel Fabritius of a chained goldfinch. It is an oil painting on panel of 33.5 by 22.8\u00a0cm (13.2 by 9.0 in). The work belongs to the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague, Netherlands.\r The painting is a trompe-l'\u0153il of a European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) on top of its feeder that is attached to the wall. The feeder consists of two half rings and a blue container. The bird is sitting on the top ring, to which it is chained by its foot. The painting is signed \"C\u00a0fabritivs 1654\" at the bottom.\r In the 17th century, goldfinches were popular pets because they could be trained to draw water from a bowl with a miniature bucket. The Dutch title of the painting pertains to the bird's nickname puttertje, which refers to this custom and translates literally as 'little weller'.\r The work was painted without major corrections, with only minor ones to the contours of the bird. Most of the painting is set up with large brush strokes, but details such as the chain are painted with more precision. Fabritius showed off his skill by painting the bird's head foreshortened.\r It is one of three paintings that Fabritius painted in the year that he died. It is painted in a style distinct from Fabritius' master Rembrandt. In style, the work is closer to Fabritius' supposed pupil Johannes Vermeer, who further improved the skill of painting shadows. Art historians have found no hard evidence to support this master-pupil relationship.\r As a trompe-l'\u0153il, it is a unique work in Dutch Golden Age painting. It has been compared with Still-Life with Partridge and Gauntlets (1540) that Jacopo de' Barbari painted more than 100 years earlier.\r The Goldfinch was owned by Chevalier Joseph-Guillaume-Jean Camberlyn in Brussels, when it was given to Etienne-Joseph-Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9 in 1865. It was sold again at H\u00f4tel Drouot in Paris on 5 December 1892. The painting was later purchased by Abraham Bredius for the Mauritshuis at the sale of the E. Martinet collection also at H\u00f4tel Drouot on 27 February 1896. The painting is in the permanent collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague.\r The painting plays a central role in the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt.\n", "\nArtist: Gabriel Metsu\nArtwork Name: The Family of Jan Jacobsz Hinlopen\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gabriel-metsu/the-family-of-jan-jacobsz-hinlopen\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of the Family Hinlopen or Family of burgomaster Gillis Valckenier is a painting in the Berlin Gem\u00e4ldegalerie by the Dutch Golden Age painter Gabri\u00ebl Metsu of about 1663. There have been various ideas among art historians as to which family is actually represented, with the two main candidates being the families of Jan J. Hinlopen or Gillis Valckenier, both wealthy and powerful figures in Amsterdam at the time.\r It is now increasingly accepted that the family are the Hinlopens. In his diary Jan J. Hinlopen made distinct notes about his marriage and family births, dates of baptisms in the Westerkerk Amsterdam, and funerals.\r Hinlopen and Leonore Huydecoper, the sister of Joan Huydecoper, had four children by 1663:\r In the second half of 1663 two members of the family died. Jan J. Hinlopen lost his youngest daughter, Geertrui, who died of measles on August 14. On October 28 his wife had a miscarriage. The next day, around ten in the evening, his servant, accompanied by two other men, most probably the undertakers, buried a small coffin in the church. On November 1, his wife Leonora died at 5.30 in the morning, after having been ill for seven days. His only son Jacob died at Pijnenburg, Jan's and Leonora's country estate. Jacob was kept isolated and it is likely he died of the plague.\r After the Geelvinck family, heirs of Sara, ceased to exist in the early 19th century, the traces to the real origins were lost. The Swiss family Tschiffely sold the painting in 1832. In the end of the 19th century it was known as depicting the Familie des Kaufmanns Gelfing. In 1907 the known Dutch art-historian Hofstede de Groot mentioned the parrot in the painting of the Familie Geelvinck. Remarkably he described the painting as langweilig (\"boring\"). In 1984 also Bob Haak describes it as depicting the Geelvinck family.\r In 1976 Van Eeghen renamed the painting to De familie van burgemeester Gillis Valckenier, and dated it in 1657. This was mainly based on the bird in the painting, which van Eeghen imagined to be a falcon. Irene Groeneweg reasons that the bird, held by the boy, is a Cuban amazon parrot. Another reason to doubt the classification is that, according to the Amsterdam City Archives, burgomaster Gillis Valckenier had only three children at the time of the painting's creation.\r Judith van Gent discovered that there was a resemblance with another Hinlopen family portrait by Bartholomeus van der Helst and that depicted by Metsu in the painting in Berlin. Additionally she discovered support for her view in Hinlopen's will. Nevertheless, the painting is still sometimes referred to as: The Family of burgomaster Gillis Valckenier.\r The atmosphere of the painting indicates a family painted in the luxury of their own home, presumably one of the modern canal mansions of Amsterdam at the time. Unfortunately the interior mantelpiece and paintings portrayed are unrecognizable. However, it was fashionable for members of the Amsterdam regency to depict one's family in the Amsterdam City Hall, which was completed in the 1650s. Being open to the councilmen and containing high windows with lots of light, the mayors' room would have enabled easy sketching for artists. This painting possibly shows the mantelpiece of the hearth by Artus Quellinus the Elder there with a painting completed by Govert Flinck in 1656.\n", "\nArtist: Gabriel Metsu\nArtwork Name: Man Writing a Letter\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gabriel-metsu/man-writing-a-letter\n\nWikipedia Article:\nMan Writing a Letter is an oil painting on a wood panel by Gabri\u00ebl Metsu made at the height of his career.

Since 1987 they can be seen in the collection of the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin.\r The painting shows a young man sitting in front of an open window, writing a letter with a quill pen. He is dressed in a black silk suit with a white linen shirt underneath. The Persian rug and silver writing set on the table also show his wealth.

The influence of Johannes Vermeer, the light from the left, the marble floor, are also unmistakable in the painting, though Metsu requires more emotional involvement of the viewer.\r Records indicate the paintings have always been owned as a pair. The paintings were owned by Hendrick Sorgh, an art collector in Amsterdam. After his death they were sold for 560\u00a0guilders on 28 March 1720 to George Bruyn. When this underwriter died they were sold on 16 March 1724 for 785\u00a0guilders to Johannes Coop, a wealthy cotton printer and dyer. Circa 1744, and for 500 guilders, they came into the possession of Gerrit Braamcamp, a collector who owned no fewer than ten works by Metsu. His heirs benefited from the artist's popularity; on 31 July 1771 the two paintings were bought for 5,205\u00a0guilders by Jan Hope. In 1898, his descendant Duke Francis Pelham-Clinton-Hope, 8th Duke of Newcastle, sold his entire collection, including the two Metsu paintings, to art dealers Wertheimer and Colnaghi & Co. in London.

Beside her, a maid in dark clothing is drawing aside a curtain in front of a painting of a naval scene in an ebony frame.

The building and courtyard seem to take precedence over the strangely detached figures in the painting. The stone tablet above the doorway was originally over the entrance of the Hieronymusdale Cloister in Delft. In English it reads: \"This is in Saint Jerome's vale, if you wish to repair to patience and meekness. For we must first descend if we wish to be raised.\" When the cloister was suppressed this tablet was removed but can still be seen set into the wall of a garden behind the canal. The two adult figures can also be seen in Interior of a Dutch House (1658) and the woman in black and red can be seen in A Boy Bringing Bread (1663). A similar composition with the same doorway can be seen in the Courtyard with an Arbour, also dated 1658, which sold in 1992 for almost seven million dollars.\r There are some subtle effects that are at variance with the overall impression of harmony. The brickwork of the wall on the right is in a sad state compared to the house on the left; there is an interesting double perspective that differentiates the two halves that are divided by the right edge of the archway and building above. Nature is making incursions to the well swept courtyard from the plant border on the right, the shrub above the couple's head and the vine obscuring the stone tablet.

Its sensitive handling of light\u2014in particular, natural light filtered into an otherwise unlit interior space\u2014led 19th century art historians to attribute it to Johannes Vermeer, with whose work the painting does bear strong similarities. However, Vermeer's work typically portrayed a woman working alone instead of a family scene as in A Woman Peeling Apples. Most scholars also now believe that de Hooch was influenced by Vermeer instead of Vermeer by de Hooch.\r The painting is in oil on canvas (67\u00a0cm \u00d7 55\u00a0cm). It is also sometimes referred to as A Woman Peeling Apples, with a Small Child. This painting by Hooch was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1908, who wrote; \"33. WOMAN PEELING APPLES. de G. 55.

It shows a group of riders on the Scheveningen beach, painted in an impressionistic style. The work is now in the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.\r Mauve was a member of the Hague School, which was known for its portrayal of the harsh existence of fishermen in Scheveningen. Here, however, Mauve chose a different subject in depicting a bourgeois group riding along the beach. The painting shows a group of riders descending to the beach, with bathing cabins ready for swimmers. The riding horses are unusual for a Mauve piece, as he was known for painting animals in their natural environment and was particularly famous for his landscapes with sheep. Mauve chose a particular color scheme of blue and yellow, which is effective in depicting the seaside atmosphere. The movement of light in the painting suggests a high amount of dynamism and motion.\r The ingenious use of light in the painting was proven to be more skillful than previously thought after a restoration of the painting was completed in 1991. The restoration removed the yellowish tinge that had permeated the work, and revealed another surprising thing. In his commitment to realism, the artist had depicted horse droppings in the scene, which one of the previous owners must have deemed sufficiently indecent to warrant a covering up.\n", "\nArtist: Akseli Gallen-Kallela\nArtwork Name: In the Sauna\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/akseli-gallen-kallela/in-the-sauna-1889\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaunassa (Finnish: In the Sauna) is an 1889 oil painting by Akseli Gallen-Kallela.

The painting illustrates a passage from the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic compiled by Elias L\u00f6nnrot in the 19th century.\r The scene portrayed is taken from the 43rd song of the epic, where the hero V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen, seen wielding a sword, has stolen the precious artifact Sampo from the evil witch Louhi, and she, having taken the form of a giant bird, is trying to reclaim it. The battle for the Sampo is also given a deeper connotation as a battle for the soul of Finland.\r When the painting was first exhibited, it received widespread attention and was considered to be Gallen-Kallela's finest work. Gallen-Kallela's vision of a warlike V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen was seen as a radical departure from the old, gray-bearded sage of older renditions. In the painting, V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen's long, flowing white hair and beard are dramatically contrasted by his strong, muscular body.\r The painting was originally commissioned by a wealthy patron from Helsinki, Salomo Wuorio, for his dining room. According to Gallen-Kallela's notes, however, the deal was amicably dissolved when the patron's wife had an extremely negative reaction to the finished work.

The central figures are reminiscent of the classic black-clad Grim Reaper, but paradoxically are tending to gardens; traditionally symbols of birth or renewal.\r The Garden of Death is one of the few paintings whose symbolism Simberg explained; typically he preferred to let viewers come to their own conclusions. In a note on one sketch he described the garden as \"the place where the dead end up before going to Heaven\".  Simberg's juxtaposition of the traditionally frightening imagery of death with the tenderness and humor of his portrayal invite the viewer to consider mortality in a new light. \r The painting was a favourite subject of Simberg's and he made several versions using different techniques, including larger fresco version of the painting in the Tampere Cathedral, which also contains other works by Simberg.\n", "\nArtist: Hugo Simberg\nArtwork Name: The Wounded Angel\nArtwork Genre: symbolic painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hugo-simberg/the-wounded-angel-1903\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Wounded Angel (Finnish: Haavoittunut enkeli) (1903) is a painting by Finnish symbolist painter Hugo Simberg. It is one of the most recognizable of Simberg's works, and was voted Finland's \"national painting\" in a vote held by the Ateneum art museum in 2006.\r Like other Simberg works, the atmosphere is melancholic: the angelic central figure with her bandaged forehead and bloodied wing, the sombre clothing of her two youthful bearers. The direct gaze of the right-hand figure touches the viewer.\r The procession passes through a recognisable landscape, that of El\u00e4intarha, Helsinki, with T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6nlahti Bay in the background. The same road still skirts T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6nlahti Bay today. In Hugo Simberg\u2019s time, the park was a popular spot for leisure-time activities among the working classes. At the time, many charity institutions were located in El\u00e4intarha park; in The Wounded Angel the healthy boys are carrying the injured girl towards the Blind Girls\u2019 School and the Home for Cripples. She clutches a bunch of snowdrops, symbolic of healing and rebirth.\r Simberg himself declined to offer any deconstruction, suggesting that the viewer draw their own conclusions. However it is known that Simberg had been suffering from meningitis, and that the painting was a source of strength during his recovery. This can also be read metaphorically: meningitis is known to cause neck stiffness, lethargy and light sensitivity, each of which is exhibited by the central figure. If read as lungs rather than wings, such a diagnosis even explains the minor injury, as tuberculor meningitis causes abrasions to the upper lungs.\r When Simberg was asked to paint frescoes for the Tampere Cathedral in 1905\u201306, one was a larger version of The Wounded Angel, his favorite painting.\n", "\nArtist: Robert Campin\nArtwork Name: The M\u00e9rode Altarpiece\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/robert-campin/the-m%C3%A9rode-altarpiece-1428\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe M\u00e9rode Altarpiece (or Annunciation Triptych) is an oil on oak panel triptych, now in The Cloisters, in New York City.

The many elements of religious symbolism include the lily and fountain (symbolising the purity of Mary), and the Holy Spirit represented by the rays of light coming falling from the left hand window.\r Art historian's interest in the M\u00e9rode Altarpiece focuses mainly on the central panel, which was completed after 1422, likely between 1425 and 1428, by a member of Campin's workshop. The outer panels are later additions by a workshop member, probably on request by the donor who sought to elevate the central panel to a triptych and place himself in the pictorial space. The wings contain views of the city of Li\u00e8ge, in today's Belgium. A version of the center panel in Brussels is earlier, and maybe Campin's original panel.\r The triptych is a founding and important work in the then emerging late Gothic, Early Netherlandish style, and has been described as a \"milestone between two periods; it at once summarizes the medieval tradition and lays the foundation for the development of modern painting\".\r The New York triptych has been at times attributed to the young Rogier van der Weyden It is today accepted as belonging to a group of paintings associated with the Master of Fl\u00e9malle, assumed to be Robert Campin, a mentor of Jan van Eyck. There is another version of the Annunciation panel in Brussels, slightly earlier but damaged, which may represent the original version by Campin.\r Technical examination of the wood panels suggest that the New York triptych was completed by a number of hands. The wood of the central panel is different and earlier to that of the wings, while the hinging further suggest that the central panel was not intended as part of a triptych. The central panel is likely a copy of an earlier composition by Campin, while the wings were probably a later commissioned by the donor, who presumably wished that they were attached to the main panel to form a devotional altarpiece, probably (given its size) for private devotion. Areas of the panels have been reworked; both the female doner and bearded man on the left wing were painted over landscape, while the window behind the Virgin was originally painted in gold.\r Campbell has dismissed the triptych's association with the Flemalle group, and thus Robert Campin. He describes the M\u00e9rode as \"incoherent in design\", in that it lacks spatial continuity between the panels, a trait most noticeable in the Seilern Triptych. In addition the open sky seen through the windows in the central is incongruous in point of view with the street scene in the donor panel. He further notes the poor command of perspective in the donor panel, and notes that it is \"unfortunate that a line of one of the mortar courses in the garden wall disappear into the donor's mouth\". Campbell disregards the wing panels as pedestrian and by lesser hands, thrown together at the will of the donor. He gives prominence to the Brussels panel, which he cautiously attributes to the Master of Fl\u00e9malle.\n", "\nArtist: Robert Campin\nArtwork Name: Werl Altarpiece\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/robert-campin/werl-altarpiece-1438\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Werl Triptych (or Triptych of Heinrich von Werl) is a triptych altarpiece completed in Cologne in 1438, of which the center panel has been lost. The two remaining wings are now in the Prado in Madrid. It was long attributed to the Master of Fl\u00e9malle, now generally believed to have been Robert Campin, although this identity is not universally accepted. Some art historians believe it may have been painted as a pastiche by either the workshop or a follower of Campin or the Master of Fl\u00e9malle.\r The right wing depicts a seated, pious Saint Barbara, who is shown engrossed in her reading of a bound and gilded holy book, seated in front of a warm open fire which lights the room with a golden glow. The left wing has a donor portrait of Heinrich von Werl, who kneels in prayer in the company of John the Baptist facing the missing devotional center-panel scene, which is lost and unrecorded. The two extant panels are in Madrid and renowned for their complex treatment of both light and form. The panels became influential on other artists from the mid-15th until the early 16th century, after when Early Netherlandish painting fell out of favour until it was rediscovered in the early 19th century.\r From an inscription in the left wing, the panels are known to have been commissioned by Heinrich von Werl, provincial head of Cologne during 1438. He is shown in the left wing kneeling in devotion alongside Saint John the Baptist. This panel contains a number of elements indebted to Jan van Eyck, notably the convex mirror in the midground, which as with the 1434 Arnolfini Marriage, reflects the scene back at the viewer.\r Although the center panel is lost with no surviving copies, inventory records or descriptions, it has been speculated that it was set in the same room occupied by Saint Barbara. This is likely given the abrupt end of the lines of the beams of the roof and the frames of the window, as well as the direction of the falling light. The center panel may have formed the setting for a Virgo inter Virgines. Given that there is no surviving evidence of the triptych's influence on Cologne art until the middle of the century, it was likely the triptych was until then positioned either in private or in an inaccessible place in the church large enough to hold a number of altarpieces. However it became influential from the mid-15th century.\r Of the two panels, that of Barbara, although flawed in some anatomical respects, is richer in detail and considered the superior piece.\r The woman in this panel can be identified as Saint Barbara from the tower visible beyond the open window to her top left. A popular saint in the Middle Ages, she was a Christian martyr believed to have lived in the 3rd century. According to hagiography, her wealthy pagan father Dioscorus, seeking to preserve her from unwelcome suitors, imprisoned her in a tower. Captive Barbara let in a priest who baptised her, an act for which she was hunted and eventually beheaded by her father. She became a popular subject for artists of Campin's generation. Jan van Eyck left a highly detailed but unfinished 1437 oak panel which focuses on the highly complex architectural details of an imagined Gothic tower.\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/the-last-judgment-detail-1426\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych (or Diptych with Calvary and Last Judgement) consists of two small painted panels attributed to the Early Netherlandish artist Jan van Eyck, with areas finished by unidentified followers or members of his workshop. This diptych is one of the early Northern Renaissance oil on panel masterpieces, renowned for its unusually complex and highly detailed iconography, and for the technical skill evident in its completion. It was executed in a miniature format; the panels are just 56.5\u00a0cm (22.2\u00a0in) high by 19.7\u00a0cm (7.8\u00a0in) wide. The diptych was probably commissioned for private devotion.\r The left-hand wing depicts the Crucifixion. It shows Christ's followers grieving in the foreground, soldiers and spectators milling about in the mid-ground and a portrayal of three crucified bodies in the upper-ground. The scene is framed against an azure sky with a view of Jerusalem in the distance. The right-hand wing portrays scenes associated with the Last Judgement: a hellscape at its base, the resurrected awaiting judgement in the centre-ground, and a representation of Christ in Majesty flanked by a Great De\u00ebsis of saints, apostles, clergy, virgins and nobility in the upper section. Portions of the work contain Greek, Latin and Hebrew inscriptions. The original gilt frames contain Biblical passages in Latin drawn from the books of Isaiah, Deuteronomy and Revelation. According to a date written in Russian on their reverse, the panels were transferred to canvas supports in 1867.\r The earliest surviving mention of the work appears in 1841, when scholars believed the two panels were wings of a lost triptych. The Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired the diptych in 1933. At that time, the work was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert because key areas formally resembled pages of the Turin-Milan Hours, which were then believed to be of Hubert's hand. On the evidence of technique and the style of dress of the figures, the majority of scholars believe the panels are late works by Jan van Eyck, executed in the early 1430s and finished after his death. Other art historians hold that van Eyck painted the panels around the early 1420s and attribute the weaker passages to a younger van Eyck's relative inexperience.\r Along with Robert Campin and later Rogier van der Weyden, Van Eyck revolutionised the approach towards naturalism and realism in Northern European painting during the early to mid 15th century. He was the first to manipulate oils to give the close detailing that infused his figures with the high degree of realism and complexity of emotion seen in this diptych. He coupled this with a mastery of glaze to create luminous surfaces with a deep perspective\u2014most noticeable in the upper portion of the Crucifixion panel\u2014which had not been achieved before.\r In the 1420s and 1430s, when oil and panel painting were still in their infancy, vertical formats were often used for depictions of the Last Judgement, because the narrow framing particularly suited a hierarchical presentation of heaven, earth and hell. By contrast, depictions of the Crucifixion were usually presented in a horizontal format. To fit such expansive and highly detailed representations onto two equally small and narrow wings, van Eyck was forced to make a number of innovations, redesigning many elements of the Crucifixion panel to match the vertical and condensed presentation of the Judgement narrative. The result is a panel with the crosses rising high into the sky, an unusually packed crowd scene in the mid-ground, and the moving spectacle of the mourners in the foreground, all rendered in a continuous slope from bottom to top in the style of medieval tapestries. Art historian Otto P\u00e4cht says it \"is the whole world in one painting, an Orbis Pictus\".\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: St. Francis Receiving the Stigmata\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/st-francis-receiving-the-stigmata\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Francis of Assisi Receiving the Stigmata is the name given to two unsigned paintings completed around 1428\u201332 that art historians usually attribute to the Flemish artist, Jan van Eyck. The panels are nearly identical, apart from a considerable difference in size. Both are small paintings: the larger measures 29.3\u00a0cm\u00a0x 33.4\u00a0cm and is in the Sabauda Gallery in Turin, Italy; the smaller panel is 12.7\u00a0cm\u00a0x 14.6\u00a0cm and in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The earliest documentary evidence is in the 1470 inventory of Anselme Adornes of Bruges's will; he may have owned both panels. From the 19th to mid-20th centuries, most scholars attributed them either to a pupil or follower of van Eyck's working from a design by the master.\r The paintings show a famous incident from the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, who is shown kneeling by a rock as he receives the stigmata of the crucified Christ on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet. Behind him are rock formations, shown in great detail, and a panoramic landscape that seems to relegate the figures to secondary importance. This treatment of Francis is the first such to appear in northern Renaissance art. The arguments attributing the works to van Eyck are circumstantial and based mainly on the style and quality of the panels. A later, third version is in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, but is weaker and strays significantly in tone and design.\r Between 1983 and 1989 the paintings underwent technical examination and were extensively restored and cleaned. Technical analysis of the Philadelphia painting established that the wood panel comes from the same tree as that of two paintings definitively attributed to van Eyck, and that the Italian panel has underdrawings of a quality that it is thought could only have come from him. After nearly 500 years, the paintings were reunited in 1998 in an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Today the consensus is that both were painted by the same hand.\r The paintings may have belonged to the Adornes family of Bruges. A copy of a will written in 1470 by Anselme Adornes, a member of one of the leading families in Bruges, was found in 1860. As he left for pilgrimage to Jerusalem, Adornes bequeathed to his two daughters in convents two paintings he describes as by van Eyck. He described one as \"with a portrait of St Francis, made by the hand of Jan van Eyck\", (\"een tavereele daerinne dat Sint-Franssen in portrature van meester Ians handt van Heyck ghemaect staet\").\r Anselme may have inherited the paintings from his father Pieter or uncle Jakob, who had travelled to Jerusalem on pilgrimage about 50 years earlier, returning to Ghent around 1427 or 1428. On their return the Adornes brothers funded a replica of Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre built in Bruges, known as the Jerusalem chapel. They may also have commissioned the two St Francis paintings as commemoration of the pilgrimage, in the fashion of the Eyckian The Three Marys at the Tomb\u00a0\u2013 attributed to Jan's brother Hubert\u00a0\u2013 a painting which may have been commissioned to commemorate a successful pilgrimage. An alternative theory is that they had the small painting prepared as a portable devotional work to bring on pilgrimage. The ownership of private devotional pieces was not uncommon\u00a0\u2013 the often itinerant Philip the Good kept an altarpiece for travelling. Even more intriguing is that Philip had van Eyck paint two identical betrothal portraits of Isabella of Portugal in 1428\u00a0\u2013 to ensure one survived the trip from Portugal\u00a0\u2013 which may have set a precedent that Bruges art patrons sought to emulate. Anselme Adornes almost certainly brought the smaller painting with him on pilgrimage in 1470; it was seen in Italy, particularly in Florence, and widely copied. In the early 1470s Sandro Botticelli, Verrochio, Filippino Lippi and Giovanni Bellini each produced variations of St Francis Receiving the Stigmata that included motifs from van Eyck's version, especially evident in the rendering of the rocky background.\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Cardinal Albergati\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/portrait-of-cardinal-albergati\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Cardinal Niccol\u00f2 Albergati is a painting by early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck, dating to around 1431 and currently housed in the Kunsthistorisches Museum of Vienna, Austria.\r Niccol\u00f2 Albergati was a diplomat working under Pope Martin V. During a peace congress in Antwerp, he met van Eyck, who portrayed him in a drawing in which the artist added notes on the colors in order to execute a later painting portrait. The drawing is now in the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen of Dresden, Germany.\r The cardinal is portrayed from three-quarters, as was usual in Flemish painting since as early as the 1430s, on a dark background which enhances the figure, which is instead subject to a bright light source. As common in van Eyck's work, attention to detail is maximum, thanks to his technique using successive layers of colors diluted with oil, which allowed him deep effects of transparency and lucidity. Comparison with the preparatory drawing shows that van Eyck changed several realistic details, such as the depth of the shoulders, the lower curve of the nose, the depth of the mouth and mainly the size of the ear, perhaps to strengthen the impression of seniority and, consequently, of authority of the cardinal.\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: St. Jerome in his Study\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oak,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/st-jerome-in-his-study-1432\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Jerome in His Study is an oil painting on panel attributed to the workshop of the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck, dated to 1442 (the year after the master's death) and now in the Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit.\r Since the date on the painting is subsequent to Jan van Eyck's death (June 1441), it is likely that the work, left unfinished, had been completed by members of his workshop, or his brother Lambert.\r A work with a similar subject is mentioned in the inventories of Palazzo Medici, in Florence, which had been drawn up after the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in 1492. Even if not the work now at Detroit, this could have been the latter's prototype, since the painting is not unanimously attributed to van Eyck. There are indeed striking similarities between this work and Domenico Ghirlandaio's Saint Jerome in His Study (1480).\r The painting depicts Saint Jerome in the traditional representation inside his study. He wears a cardinal's dress and hat, and is reading a book, in a small study clogged with numerous objects showing his erudition and interests.

It is considered a masterpiece of European art and one of the world's treasures.\r The panels are organised in two vertical registers, each with two sets of foldable wings with inner and outer panel paintings. The upper register of the inner panels contains form the central De\u00ebsis of Christ the King, Virgin Mary and John the Baptist. They are immediately flanked, in the next panels by music playing angels, and, on the far outermost panels, the naked figures of Adam and Eve. The four lower-register panels are divided into two pairs; sculptural grisaille paintings of St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist, and on the two outer panels, donor portraits of Joost Vijdt and his wife Lysbette Borluut. The central panel of the lower register shows a gathering of saints, sinners, clergy and soldiers attendant at an adoration of the Lamb of God. There are several groupings of figures, overseen by the dove of the Holy Spirit.\r Art historians generally agree that the overall structure was designed by Hubert in the early to mid 1420s, and that the panels were painted by his younger brother Jan between 1430 and 1432. One of the most renowned and important paintings in art history, generations of art historians have attempted to attribute specific passage to either brother, however no convincing separation has been established. The altarpiece was commissioned by the merchant and Ghent mayor Jodocus Vijd and his wife Lysbette as part of a larger project for the Saint Bavo Cathedral chapel. The altarpiece's installation was officially celebrated on 6 May 1432. It was much later moved for security reasons to the principal cathedral chapel, where it remains. While indebted to the International Gothic as well as Byzantine and Romanic traditions, the altarpiece represented a huge advancement in art, in which the idealisation of the medieval tradition gave way to an exacting observation of nature and human representation.

(also Portrait of a Man in a Turban or Portrait of a Man in a Red Turban) is an oil painting by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck, from 1433. The inscription at the top of the panel, Als Ich Can (intended as \"as I/Eyck can\") was a common autograph for van Eyck, but here is unusually large and prominent. This fact, along with the man's unusually direct and confrontational gaze, have been taken as an indication that the work is a self-portrait.  Probably his Portrait of Margaret van Eyck was a pendant, although her only known portrait is both dated 1439 and larger. It has been proposed that van Eyck created the portrait to store in his workshop so that he could use it display his abilities (and social status, given the fine clothes evident in the portrait) to potential clients. However, his reputation was such in 1433 that he was already highly sought after for commissioned work.  The panel has been in the National Gallery, London, since 1851, having been in England since Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel acquired it, probably during his exile in Antwerp from 1642\u201344.  The original frame survives (the vertical sides are in fact a single piece of wood with the central panel), and has the painted inscription \"JOHES DE EYCK ME FECIT ANO MCCCC.33. 21. OCTOBRIS\" (\"Jan van Eyck Made Me on October 21, 1433\") at the bottom, and at the top, the motto \"AlC IXH XAN\" (\"As Well As I Can\"), which appears on other van Eyck paintings, always written in Greek letters, and includes a pun on his name.  As on other van Eyck frames, the letters are painted to appear carved.  Autographing and dating panel paintings in the early 15th century was unusual. Even when dates were added they tended to be for the year only, whereas here van Eyck spells out the specific date, October 21st. As too few of his paintings survive (the extant works number somewhere in the low 20s) to judge his prolificacy, the degree of detail and skill indicates that they took months rather than days to complete. Thus the date may have served as a boast to potential commissioners rather than as a matter of fact.  Since the motto Als Ich Can appears in many of van Eyck's other works, it is believed that he is challenging other artists to do better than him. Although written in Greek letters, the phrase is originally Flemish. Having a Flemish phrase in Greek writing implies van Eyck saw himself in \"competition with the ancients as well as with his contemporaries\". Regardless of his reasoning behind including the motto in many of his works, it can be implied the phrase is a sign of van Eyck's self-consciousness about his work as a painter.  Like all van Eyck's portraits, it shows a sharp and detailed analysis of the subject. The painting is a third life-size with the sitter sitting in three-quarters profile. His stubbled face is heavily lined with the onset of middle age, and his eyes are semi-bloodshot. He look outwards with a piercing gaze, looking directly at the viewer\u2014possibly being the first portrait in a millennium to do so. His weary facial expression is achieved through a combination of his strong nose, tightly pursed by wide mouth and the framing of his face by the headdress. The overall expression is of a man, whom one scholar says \"see things \u2013 himself included \u2013 in close-up, but without losing track of the bigger picture.\"\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: The Ince Hall Madonna (The Virgin and Child Reading)\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/madonna-from-the-inn-s-hall-1433\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Virgin and Child Reading is an oil painting of uncertain date. It is a mid-to-late 15th century imitation of the work of the Early Netherlandish master Jan van Eyck, possibly after a now-lost original painting by him from 1433 - another copy of the same work is now in the Colegiata church in Covarrubias, Spain. It is first documented in 1619, when it was in Sicily and then re-appeared in Charles Blundell's collection at Ince Blundell Hall near Liverpool early in the 19th century, meaning it is sometimes known as the Ince Hall Madonna. George Frederick Zink restored it there in 1822. It was acquired from the Weld-Blundell family by the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) in Melbourne in 1922 using funds from the Felton Bequest.\r The inscription on the wall at top left reads: \"COPLETV ANO D M CCCC XXXIIJ P IOHEM DE EYC BRVGIS\". This translates as \"Completed in the Year of Our Lord 1433 by Jan van Eyck, Bruges\". To the right of the tapestry is van Eyck's personal motto in Greek letters \"ALC IXH XAN\" (\"As I Can\"), playing on the similarity between his surname and 'IXH' (an approximate transliteration of \"ich\" or \"I\" into ancient Greek characters).\r On its acquisition by the NGV in 1922 it was held to be an autograph work by van Eyck. However, laboratory tests in 1958 by P. Coremans, A. Philippot and R.V. Sneyers at the IRPA in Belgium, an infrared spectroscopy study in 2003 and other features have all contributed to its de-attribution. For example, the spatial relationship between the two figures and the surrounding furniture is only vaguely hinted at and the work's grasp of perspective and depth is not as developed as in the autograph Lucca Madonna and Rolin Madonna. The letter formation in the signature does not correspond to the confirmed signatures on the Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele or the Dresden Triptych. The signature also appears in the scene itself, rather than van Eyck's more usual practice of signing on the frame - some art historians argue that the work was originally in just such a signed frame but that after that frame was lost it was added to the work itself by an unknown hand.\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: Man in a Blue Turban\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/man-in-a-blue-turban-1433\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of a Man with a Blue Chaperon (or Portrait of a Man with a Blue Hood, earlier Portrait of a Jeweler or Man with a Ring) is a very small (22.5 cm x 16.6 cm with frame) oil on panel portrait of an unidentified man attributed to the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck.\r The painting was commissioned and completed sometime around 1430. It contains a number of elements typical of van Eyck's secular portraits, including a slightly oversized head, a dark and flat background, forensic attention to the small details and textures of the man's face, and illusionistic devices. Artists did not give titles to their works during the Northern Renaissance period, and as with any portrait of a sitter whose identity is lost, the painting has attracted generic titles over the years. It had long been thought that the ring held in the man's right hand was meant as an indication of his profession as a jeweler or goldsmith and so the painting was long titled on variants of such. More recently the ring is interpreted as an emblem of betrothal and the titles given by various art historians and publications since are usually more descriptive of the colour or form of the headdress.\r The painting was attributed to van Eyck in the late 19th century, but this was repeatedly challenged by some art historians until a 1991 cleaning when infra-red photography revealed an underdrawing and methods of handling of oil that were unmistakably van Eyck's.\r Prior to 1948, the panel belonged to the Brukenthal National Museum in Sibiu, Romania. That year, the new Communist regime seized the panel, along with eighteen others it considered the museum's most valuable holdings, and gave it to the National Museum of Art of Romania in Bucharest. At the end of 2006, in time for Sibiu's stint as European Capital of Culture, the works were returned to the Brukenthal Museum.\r The man is shown in three-quarters view with his face dramatically lit by light falling from the left. This device provides both striking contrasts of light and shadow and draws the viewer's attention on to the man's face. He has brown eyes, and while his expression is impassive there are traces of melancholy, especially in the down-turn of his mouth. He is obviously a member of the nobility, being very well dressed in a fur lined brown jacket over a black undervest. His headdress, a chaperon, contains two wings which hang down over the man's shoulders and extend to his chest. The edges of the cloth are given a shredded look at the edges of their trains. The hood is brightly and dramatically coloured using pigment extracted from the expensive lapis lazuli gemstone to give it its bright, intense hue. The headdress is of a similar but less extravagant type to that seen in van Eyck's c. 1433 Portrait of a Man, and worn by a figure in the distance in his c. 1435 Madonna of Chancellor Rolin. This type of headdress was to go out of fashion by the mid 1430s, conveniently and definitively dating the painting as having been completed before then.\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: The Arnolfini Wedding.

It forms a full-length double portrait, believed to depict the Italian merchant Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife, presumably in their home in the Flemish city of Bruges.\r It is considered one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art, because of its beauty, complex iconography, geometric orthogonal perspective, and expansion of the picture space with the use of a mirror. According to Ernst Gombrich \"in its own way it was as new and revolutionary as Donatello's or Masaccio's work in Italy. A simple corner of the real world had suddenly been fixed on to a panel as if by magic\u00a0... For the first time in history the artist became the perfect eye-witness in the truest sense of the term\". The portrait has been considered by Erwin Panofsky and some other art historians as a unique form of marriage contract, recorded as a painting. Signed and dated by van Eyck in 1434, it is, with the Ghent Altarpiece by the same artist and his brother Hubert, the oldest very famous panel painting to have been executed in oils rather than in tempera. The painting was bought by the National Gallery in London in 1842.\r Van Eyck used the technique of applying layer after layer of thin translucent glazes to create a painting with an intensity of both tone and colour. The glowing colours also help to highlight the realism, and to show the material wealth and opulence of Arnolfini's world. Van Eyck took advantage of the longer drying time of oil paint, compared to tempera, to blend colours by painting wet-in-wet to achieve subtle variations in light and shade to heighten the illusion of three-dimensional forms. The medium of oil paint also permitted van Eyck to capture surface appearance and distinguish textures precisely. He also rendered the effects of both direct and diffuse light by showing the light from the window on the left reflected by various surfaces. It has been suggested that he used a magnifying glass in order to paint the minute details such as the individual highlights on each of the amber beads hanging beside the mirror.\r The illusionism of the painting was remarkable for its time, in part for the rendering of detail, but particularly for the use of light to evoke space in an interior, for \"its utterly convincing depiction of a room, as well of the people who inhabit it\". Whatever meaning is given to the scene and its details, and there has been much debate on this, according to Craig Harbison the painting \"is the only fifteenth-century Northern panel to survive in which the artist's contemporaries are shown engaged in some sort of action in a contemporary interior. It is indeed tempting to call this the first genre painting \u2013 a painting of everyday life \u2013 of modern times\".\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Baudouin de Lannoy\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/portrait-of-baudouin-de-lannoy-1435\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Baudouin de Lannoy is a small oil-on panel portrait by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck, completed c. 1435. It shows Baldwin of Lannoy, a contemporary Flemish statesman and ambassador for Philip the Good at the court of Henry V of England. From surviving documents it is known that the work was commissioned to mark his entry into the order Baudouin de Lanno. He is in a formal pose, holding a wooden stick in his right hand, and a gold ring on his little finger. Van Eyck's surviving early portraits typically show the sitter holding an emblem of his profession and class.\r The man is dressed in ceremonial robes, with the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece around his neck. His coat contains dark embroidered motifs in gold, shaped like oak leaves or ferns. The coat contains large strands of red fur lining at the neck and each wrist. His large black felt hat is similar to that worn by Giovanni Arnolfini in van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait of 1434. Van Eyck has taken a number of liberties with reality to accentuate the features of his model. In particular, the man's head is out of proportion to his body. However, the artist has done nothing to embellish the portrait, presenting the man as he actually looked, with no hit or trace of the idealisation of the early 15th century.\r Its first recorded mention is as part of a collection of portrait copies in the Recueil d'Arras. Today it is housed in the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Gemaldegalerie, Berlin. X radiograph analysis dates the growth rings in the wood as between 1205 and 1383, and that the wood was taken from the same tree as the board in his Portrait of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini (1438) and the Philadelphia Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata (c. 1430-32) usually attributed to van Eyck or his workshop.\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/portrait-of-giovanni-arnolfini-1435\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini is a small c. 1438 portrait by Jan van Eyck believed to be the same person as in the famous 1434 Arnolfini Portrait due to the similarities of facial features. Thus, the work is van Eyck's second portrait of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini, a wealthy merchant from Lucca, a city in Tuscany in central Italy, who spent most of his life in Flanders. The painting was long thought a self-portrait; in colourisation, costume and tone, it is very similar to the signed and dated Portrait of a Man in a Red Chaperon in London, which is generally accepted as a self-portrait. It was only later that the current work was associated with Arnolfini and the double marriage painting. It is today in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin.\r Arnolfini wears a dark green gown, with dark brown fur lining. He wears a red chaperon with cornette tied on top of the head, with the patte hanging behind. The bourrelet is twisted. He is depicted with exacting realism; no attempt is made to gloss over his facial imperfections. He has small, slightly oriental eyes, a large nose and an inscrutable stare.\r The meaning and significance of the scroll held in his left hand is unknown. It may relate to finance and trade, it might be a type of international credit note that was then just being introduced to European banking.\r Arnolfini's folded arms would have rested on the original, but now lost, frame. As with van Eyck's other single head portraits, the frame would have contained inscriptions giving the date of completion. Opinion as to the date of the painting has varied, with the likely dates ranging from 1434 to 1438. Today the later date is generally accepted.\r That van Eyck painted two portraits of Arnolfini has led to speculation he was a friend of the artist. For many years the two works were not associated, and the identity of the sitters was unknown. Often the London double portrait was taken as a portrait of the artist and his wife, Margaret. In 1857, Crowe and Cavalcaselle linked the London double portrait with the early 16th century inventories of Margaret of Austria, and established the sitters as Giovanni [di Arrigo] Arnolfini and his (possibly already deceased) wife, Giovanna Cenami.\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: The Annunciation\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/the-annunciation\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Annunciation is an oil painting by the Early Netherlandish master Jan van Eyck, from around 1434-1436. The panel is housed in the National Gallery of Art, in Washington D.C. It was originally on panel but has been transferred to canvas. It is thought that it was the left (inner) wing of a triptych; there has been no sighting of the other wings since before 1817. The annunciation is a highly complex work, whose iconography is still debated by art historians.\r The picture depicts the Annunciation by the Archangel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary that she will bear the son of God (Luke 1:26-38). The inscription shows his words: AVE GR\u00c3. PLENA or \"Hail, full of grace...\". She modestly draws back and responds, ECCE ANCILLA D\u00d1I or \"Behold the handmaiden of the Lord\". The words appear upside down because they are directed to God and are therefore inscribed with a God's-eye view. The Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit descend to her on seven rays of light from the upper window to the left, with the dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit following the same path; \"This is the moment God's plan for salvation is set in motion. Through Christ's human incarnation the old era of the Law is transformed into a new era of Grace\".\r The setting develops this theme. Mary was believed in the Middle Ages to have been a very studious girl who was engaged by the Temple of Jerusalem with other selected maidens to spin new curtains for the Holy of Holies. The book she is reading here is too large to be a lady's Book of Hours; as in other paintings she is engaged in serious study in a part of the Temple (one medieval authority specified that she was reading the Book of Isaiah when Gabriel arrived). The van Eycks were almost the first to use this setting in panel painting, but it appears earlier in illuminated manuscripts, and in an altarpiece of 1397 from the same monastery for which this painting was probably ordered.\r The architecture moves from older, round Romanesque forms above, to (slightly) pointed Gothic arches below, with the higher levels largely in darkness, and the floor level well-lit. The gloom of the Old Covenant is about to be succeeded by the light of the New Covenant. The flat timber roof is in poor repair, with planks out of place. The use of Romanesque architecture to identify Jewish rather than Christian settings is a regular feature of the paintings of van Eyck and his followers, and other paintings show both styles in the same building in a symbolic way.\r The decoration of the Temple is naturally all derived from the Old Testament, but the subjects shown are those believed in the Middle Ages to prefigure the coming of Christ the Messiah. In the floor tiles David's slaying of Goliath (centre front), foretells Christ's triumph over the devil. Behind this, Samson pulls down the Temple of the Philistines, prefiguring both the Crucifixion and the Last Judgement, according to medieval authorities. To the left, Delilah is cutting Samson's hair (Betrayal of Christ), and behind he slays the Philistines (Christ's triumph over sin). The death of Absalom and possibly that of Abimelech are identified by some art historians, although only tiny sections are visible. Erwin Panofsky, who developed much of this analysis, proposed a scheme for the significance of the astrological symbols in the round border tiles, and other versions have been suggested.\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: Madonna and Child with Canon Joris van der Paele\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/madonna-and-child-with-canon-joris-van-der-paele-1436\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele is a large oil-on-oak panel painting completed around 1434\u201336 by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. It shows the painting's donor, Joris van der Paele, within an apparition of saints. The Virgin Mary is enthroned at the centre of the semicircular space, which most likely represents a church interior, with the Christ Child on her lap. St. Donatian stands to her right, Saint George \u2014 the donor's name saint \u2014 to her left. The panel was commissioned by van der Paele as an altarpiece. He was then a wealthy clergyman from Bruges, but elderly and gravely ill, and intended the work as his memorial.\r The saints are identifiable from Latin inscriptions lining the borders of the imitation bronze frame, which is original. Van der Paele is identifiable from historical records. He is dressed in the finery of a medieval canon, including white surplice, as he piously reads from a book of hours. He is presented to Mary by Saint George, his name saint, who holds aloft his metal helmet in respect. Saint Donatian, dressed in brightly coloured vestments, stands to the left. The panel is noted for the finery of clothing, including exquisite representations of furs, silks and brocades, and the elaborate and detailed religious iconography. The Virgin's throne is decorated with carved representations of Adam and Eve, prefigurations of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus, and scenes from the Old Testament. The painting is lined with a series of inscriptions which comment on the saints, and include van Eyck's signature.\r The van der Paele panel is widely considered one of van Eyck's most fully realised and ambitious works, and has been described as a \"masterpiece of masterpieces\".\r Joris van der Paele is identifiable both from his resemblance and by the paternal and maternal (the Carlans') coat of arms at the corners of each frame. He was born in Bruges around 1370, and spent his early career as a papal scribe in Rome before returning to his native city in 1425 as a wealthy man. He was appointed to a canonry of St. Donatian's collegiate church, a position which gave him income from the various parishes under his remit.\r An illness around 1431 left van der Paele unable to fulfil the functions of his office, and led him to reflect upon his position as canon and on his mortality. In response he endowed a chaplaincy to the church and commissioned this work from van Eyck. The artist was at the height of his fame and in high demand, and this, along with the large size of the panel, meant that the commission took a lot longer to complete than was initially envisioned; two completion dates can be found on the frame, implying that the earlier date was aspirational and missed.\r In return for the bequest, the church granted the canon a requiem mass, a daily mass and three votive masses a week, meant to intercede with the divine on his behalf. A second chaplaincy in 1443 centred on prayers for his family, and guaranteed that after his death, the requiem mass would end with readings of the Miserere mei and De profundis.\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Jan de Leeuw\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/portrait-of-jan-de-leeuw-1436\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Jan de Leeuw is a small 1436 oil on wood painting by the Early Netherlandish master Jan van Eyck, now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. De Leeuw was a goldsmith living in Bruges; most art historians accept that, given the familiarity of the portrait, that he and van Eyck knew each other and were on good terms. The work is still in its original frame, which is painted over to look like bronze.\r Like the London self-portrait, the painting is dominated by black and dark brown hues, with red overtones. De Leeuw is presented as a serious young man with a rather intense gaze. He is wearing a black chaperon and black fur lined jacket. He turns to look at the viewer while holding a gold ring band with a red jewel, a symbol of his profession, although some have suggested that it might indicate a recent marriage engagement, or even, given his direct gaze, that the painted is meant for his intended.\r Formally and tonally, it closely resembles van Eyck's supposed self-portrait in the National Gallery, London. In both works, the head is oversized in relation to the torso. The Vienna panel is still in its original frame, which closely resembles that of the London panel, the central panel of the Dresden Triptych, and a number of works by his workshop; likely they were all put together by the same craftsman. The frame is painted over to look like bronze.\r The panel's borders contains a fictive frame, which is heavily inscribed on all sides. The letters are painted in black, and are in the Flemish vernacular. The numerals are rendered in Arabic script. The lettering addresses the viewer directly, and reads, IAN DE {LEEUW} OP SANT ORSELEN DACH / DAT CLAER EERST MET OGHEN SACH, 1401 / GHECONTERFEIT NV HEEFT MI IAN / VAN EYCK WEL BLIICT WANNEERT BEGA(N) 1436 (Jan De [Leeuw], who First Opened His Eyes on the Feast of St Ursula [21 October], 1401. Now Jan Van Eyck Has Painted Me, You Can See When He Began it. 1436). The word \"Leeuw\" is substituted for a pictogram of a golden lion, a play on the sitter's surname - \"Leeuw\", means lion in Dutch. Parts of the lettering are carved into the fictive frame's border, other pieces are raised from it in relief.\r The inscription seems to contain three of chronograms, \"a type of sophisticated word puzzle popular among humanists of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\", where the years in the text are represented when the values of the Roman numerals are summed. According to Bauman they can be found in its year of completion, the year of the sitter's birth and his age, although both Max Friedl\u00e4nder and Erwin Panofsky only accepted the first two.\r Addressing the frank and direct aspect of the inscription, art historian Till-Holger Borchert remarked that the picture \"appears to be speaking: the portrait address the viewer in the first person singular. The dialogue with the viewer initiated by the challenging gaze of the sitter is continued in the \"spoken\" address on the frame\". This sentiment is echoed by Guy Bauman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art who wrote in 1986 that, \"Van Eyck seems, in a God-like way, not only to have endowed the sitter with sight and to have affected his rebirth, but also, recalling Fazio's remark, to have given the portrait a voice\".\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: The Lucca Madonna\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/the-lucca-madonna-1436\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Lucca Madonna is a 1436 oil painting of the Madonna and Child by the Early Netherlandish master Jan van Eyck. It shows Mary seated on a wooden throne and crowned by a canopy, breastfeeding the infant Christ. Its carpentry suggests it was once the inner panel of a triptych, while its small size indicates it was meant for private devotion. The painting is in the collection of the St\u00e4del Museum, Frankfurt.\r It is known as Lucca Madonna as it belonged to the collection of Charles II, Duke of Parma and Lucca in the early 19th century. It is one of the latest works by Jan van Eyck. The Virgin has been identified as a portrait of the painters's wife, Margaretha, of whom van Eyck also made a secular portrait.\r The Virgin sits on a throne with four small lion statues, a reference to the throne of Solomon which had twelve lions on the sides and steps. The iconography mixes the earlier style of the \"Nursing Madonna\" with the \"Throne of Wisdom\". As the Speculum Humanae Salvationis put it: \"the throne of the true Solomon is the most Blessed Virgin Mary, In which sat Jesus Christ, the true wisdom.\"\r As in many paintings by van Eyck and his contemporaries, this comparison is further elaborated by specifically depicting Mary similar to an altar, in that she supports the infant Christ on her lap, shown oversized and flattened, just as the altar supports the presence of Christ in the host at Mass. The white cloth beneath him, over the richer coloured cloth of Mary's dress, and the niche to the right which resembles a piscina where water for the priest to wash his hands was kept, all contribute to the comparison. The unusual shape of the room, very narrow for such a large chair, suggests a small chapel.\r The two fruits on the windowsill have not been positively identified, but they are either apples or oranges, both of which would be allusions to paradise. The right side wall is a mirror image to the window, while a shelf contains empty candlestick and a half-filled glass carafe, or flask. There is a large bowl or sink on the lower ledge. The floor tiles are formed from blue and white, geometrical patterns, mostly covered by the carpet centered around the base of the throne.\r The Lucca Madonna is one of six extant Madonna paintings by van Eyck that are dated to the period between his completion of the Ghent Altarpiece and his death in June 1441.

It is kept in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris, and was commissioned by Nicolas Rolin, aged 60, chancellor of the Duchy of Burgundy, whose votive portrait takes up the left side of the picture, for his parish church, Notre-Dame-du-Chastel in Autun, where it remained until the church burnt down in 1793. After a period in Autun Cathedral, it was moved to the Louvre in 1805.  The scene depicts the Virgin Mary crowned by a hovering Angel while she presents the Infants Jesus to Rolin. It is set within a spacious loggia with a rich decoration of columns and bas-reliefs. In the background is a landscape with a city on a river, probably intended to be Autun in Burgundy, Rolin's hometown. A wide range of well detailed palaces, churches, an island, a towered bridge, hills and fields is portrayed, subject to a uniform light. Perhaps some of the Chancellor's many landholdings around Autun are included in the vista.  A haze covers a mountain range in the far distance.  As in many Early Netherlandish paintings, the steepness of the hills and mountains is shown as much greater than that found locally, for dramatic effect.  The small garden with many flowers identifiable (including lilies, irises, paeonies and roses), visible just outside the columns, symbolizes Mary's virtues.  Beyond, two male figures wearing chaperons are looking through the crenellations of what looks to be a fortified balcony or bridge.  There has been speculation that they may represent van Eyck and an assistant, after the pattern of his Arnolfini Portrait.  The figure on the right wears a similar red chaperon to the probable van Eyck self-portrait in the National Gallery, London.  Near to them are two magpies and two peacocks, the latter are symbols both of immortality and of pride, to which even a powerful man as Rolin might succumb. However Mart\u00ed Dom\u00ednguez states- Peacocks were the symbol of Jesus Christ and magpies were regarded as evil. Artists like to oppose the symbolic birds, the dichotomy between good and evil: Van Eyck, in the panel of the Chancellor Rolin, will also use the peacock and the magpie.  The interior has complex light sources, typical of van Eyck, with light coming both from the central portico and the side windows. The chancellor, whose strong character is well rendered by the artist, is wearing a fur-lined, elegant garment; the Virgin, the same size as Rolin (rather a novelty in comparison to the Gothic painting tradition), is instead covered by a red mantle. The Infant Jesus holds a cross in his left hand. The perfectionist rendering of details and textures, such as the capitals, the checquered pavement, the goldwork of the angel's crown or the garments is characteristic of Jan van Eyck's work, of which this is one of the finest examples.  As in other van Eycks, the depiction of the space is not as straightforward as it first appears.  Comparison of the floor-tiles with other elements shows that the figures are only about six feet from the columned loggia screen, and that Rolin might have to squeeze himself through the opening to get out that way.  Many van Eycks show an interior space that is actually very small, but the depiction is subtly managed to retain a sense of intimacy, but without feeling constricted.\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: St. Barbara\nArtwork Genre: sketch and study\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/st-barbara-1437-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Barbara is a small 1437 drawing on oak panel, signed and dated 1437 by the Netherlandish artist Jan van Eyck. It is unknown if the work is a chalk ground study in pencil for a planned oil painting, an unfinished underdrawing or a completed work in of itself. It shows Saint Barbara imprisoned in a tower by her pagan father, to preserve her from the outside world, especially from suitors he did not approve of. While there, she converted to Christianity, enraging her father and leading to her murder and martyrdom.\r Found on a chalk ground, the panel was completed with brush stroke, a stylus, silverpoint, ink, oil and black pigment. The blue and ultramarine paint may be later additions. Some areas and passages are more detailed than others, and it has long been debated if it is an autonomous drawing or the underdrawing for an unfinished painting. If it was intended as extant, it would be the earliest surviving drawing of any artist, although not prepared on paper or parchment. Evidence includes that the work was highly regarded at the time by Flemish aesthetics as an object in itself.\r The original is in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp.\r Saint Barbara was a Christian martyr believed to have lived in the 3rd century, and a popular saint in the late Middle Ages. According to hagiography, her wealthy and pagan father, Dioscorus, sought to preserve her from unwelcome suitors by imprisoning her in a tower. While captive, Barbara let in a priest who baptised her, an act for which she was hunted and eventually beheaded by her father. She became a popular subject for artists of van Eyck's generation; another notable contemporary depiction is Robert Campin's 1438 Werl Triptych.\r Barbara is shown seated reading a book, in front of a large Gothic cathedral still in the process of being built, with many workmen visible on the ground carry stone and on various parts of the tower. She has the typical narrow shoulders of a female van Eyck portrait. She is dressed in houppelande with wide sleeves, and a gown which is gathered at the waist. The opening in her bodice rises to a deep v-neck, while the trim rises to form a collar made of fur. Below the v-neck is a dark partlet, a rectangular piece of cloth with an open, standing collar, which is perhaps made of taffeta. As a maiden, she is bare headed.\r Three women behind and to Barbara's left are seen visiting the construction, each wearing similar houppelandes. The woman in the center raises her skirt to show her kirtle. They are each wearing headdress, probably burlets with ruffled golets draped from the head.\r The drawing is set against a blue wash sky sweeping landscape rendered in browns, whites and blues, with parts only sketchily detailed. The elements of the tower are highly described, and contain many complex architectural details. In a number of respects it resembles the Cologne cathedral, which in 1437 was still under construction. Van Eyck had earlier depicted the cathedral as well as a view of Cologne in the Adoration of the Lamb panel of the Ghent Altarpiece.\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: Dresden Triptych (Virgin and Child with St. Michael and St. Catherine and a Donor)\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/the-virgin-and-child-in-a-church-1437\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  The Dresden Triptych (or Virgin and Child with St. Michael and St. Catherine and a Donor, or Triptych of the Virgin and Child) is a very small hinged-triptych altarpiece by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. It consists of five individual panel paintings: a central inner panel, and two double-sided wings. It is signed and dated 1437, and in the permanent collection of the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden, with the panels still in their original frames. The only extant triptych attributed to van Eyck, and the only non-portrait signed with his personal motto, ALC IXH XAN (\"I Do as I Can\"). the triptych can be placed at the midpoint of his known works. It echoes a number of the motifs of his earlier works while marking an advancement in his ability in handling depth of space, and establishes iconographic elements of Marian portraiture that were to become widespread by the latter half of the 15th\u00a0century. Elisabeth Dhanens describes it as \"the most charming, delicate and appealing work by Jan van Eyck that has survived\".  The paintings on the two outer wings become visible when the triptych is closed. They show the Virgin Mary and Archangel Gabriel in an Annunciation scene painted in grisaille, which because of their near-monochrome colouring give the impression that the figures are sculpted. The three inner panels are set in an ecclesiastical interior. In the central inner panel Mary is seated and holds the Christ Child on her lap. On the left hand wing Archangel Michael presents a kneeling donor, while on the right St. Catherine of Alexandria stands reading a prayer book. The interior panels are outlined with two layers of painted bronze frames, inscribed with mostly Latin lettering. The texts are drawn from a variety of sources, in the central frames from biblical descriptions of the assumption, while the inner wings are lined with fragments of prayers dedicated to saints Michael and Catherine.  The work may have been intended for private devotion, perhaps as a portable altarpiece for a migrant cleric. That the frames are so richly decorated with Latin inscriptions indicates the donor, whose identity is lost, was highly educated and cultured. Because of a lack of surviving documentary evidence on commissions of 15th\u00a0century-Northern painting, the identities of donors are often established through evidence gathered by modern art historians. In this work, damaged coats of arms on the borders of the interior wings have been identified with the Giustiniani of Genoa\u00a0\u2013 an influential albergo active from 1362\u00a0\u2013 who established trade links with Bruges as early as the mid-14th century.  The Dresden Triptych was probably in the possession of the Giustiniani family in the mid- to late-15th century. It is mentioned in a May 10, 1597 record of a purchase by Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, and was then sold with the Gonzaga Collection to Charles I of England in 1627. After Charles's fall and execution, the painting went to Paris and was owned by Eberhard Jabach, the Cologne-based banker and art dealer for Louis XIV and Cardinal Mazarin. A year after Jabach's death in 1695, it passed to the Elector of Saxony, and next appears in a 1754 inventory of the Dresden Collection, attributed to Albrecht D\u00fcrer, until the German historian Aloys Hirt in 1830 established it as a van Eyck. In the mid-19th century the Dresden catalogues first attribute it to Hubert van Eyck (d.\u00a01426) and a few years later to Jan.\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: Madonna at the Fountain\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/madonna-at-the-fountain-1439\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna at the Fountain is a 1439 oil on panel painting by the early Netherlandish artist Jan van Eyck. It belongs to van Eyck's late work, and is his last signed and dated painting. It retains its original frame, which bears the inscription; \"ALS IXH CAN\", \"JOHES DE EYCK ME FECIT + [COM]PLEVIT ANNO 1439\r At 19 x 12\u00a0cm. the painting is only a little larger than a postcard. It is set in a hortus conclusus, with the fountain representing the fountain of life. The Madonna is depicted dressed in blue, her figure framed by a richly embroidered cloth of honor supported by two angels. The Christ Child holds prayer beads in his left hand, suggesting, along with the rose bush behind the figures, the rosary. In the mid to late 15th century the rosary was becoming increasingly popular in northern Europe.\r This depiction is unusual in that the Madonna wears a blue robe; in the Dresden Triptych, Lucca Madonna, and the Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, van Eyck had depicted her dressed in red. The use of red for the clothes of sacred figures was characteristic of 15th century Netherlandish painting, as cochineal was among the most expensive pigments available for dying textiles. In contrast to this, Italian painters used ultramarine for the robes of Madonnas. Thus van Eyck's choice of blue can be seen as evidence of Italian influence.\r With the Madonna in the Church in Berlin, this is generally thought to have been one of van Eyck's two paintings of the Madonna and Child from the final years before his death in about 1441. Both show a standing Virgin, in contrast to his earlier treatments of the subject, and the great majority of other painted Virgins. Models for standing Virgins existed in the icons of Byzantine art, and both paintings also represent modified version of the eleusa type, sometimes called the Virgin of Tenderness in English, where the Virgin and Child touch cheeks, and he reaches out a hand. The Madonna in the Church wears a blue cloak over a red dress.\r During the early 14th and 15th century a large number of these works were imported into the North, and were widely copied by the first generation of Netherlandish artists, among others. The iconography of both the late Byzantine, typified by the unknown artist responsible for the Cambrai Madonna, and 14th century successors such as Giotto favoured showing the Madonna in a monumental scale, and it is accepted by art historians that van Eyck absorbed these influences, though when and through which works is disputed. It is believed that he had direct exposure to them during his visit to Italy, which occurred either in 1426 or 1428. Van Eyck's two panels carried forward the habit of reproduction and were themselves frequently copied by commercial workshops throughout the 15th century. \r It is possible that the Byzantine flavour to these images was also connected with contemporary attempts through diplomacy to achieve reconciliation with the Greek Orthodox Church, in which van Eyck's patron Philip the Good took a keen interest. Van Eyck's Portrait of Cardinal Niccol\u00f2 Albergati (c. 1431) had depicted one of the diplomats most involved with these efforts, acting for the Papacy.\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Margaret van Eyck\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/portrait-of-margaret-van-eyck-1439\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Margaret van Eyck (or Margaret, the Artist's Wife) is a 1439 oil on wood painting by the Early Netherlandish master Jan van Eyck.

The work is thought to be a pendant or diptych panel for either a now lost self-portrait known from records until 1769, or of Jan van Eyck's likely self-portrait now in the National Gallery in London.\r The reason for its inception is unknown; but that it was created for private rather than public viewing can be inferred from the sitter's unidealised representation and her direct but plaintive gaze towards the viewer, which creates an intimate and informal atmosphere. The painting was probably created to mark an occasion; maybe to commemorate the couple's anniversary, or her birthday, or as a gift to her.\r Van Eyck died within two years of this work. He inscribed plates on the top and ends of the frame in Greek lettering with the words, My husband Johannes completed me in the year 1439 on 17 June, at the age of 33. As I can. \"As I can\" (ALS ICH KAN) was something of a personal motto and motif for van Eyck, as well as a pun on his surname. It can be found inscribed on several of his religious paintings, though on only two portraits.\r Margaret is shown in three-quarter view, that is her body almost directly facing the viewer but not quite. She is set against a flat black and featureless background, wearing an elegant red woolen gown with grey fur lining (in the medieval period fur often represented female sexuality), probably from squirrel, in the neck and cuffs. Her horned wimple is decorated with fine lace. Her left eye shows evidence of a squint, a feature unusually evident in northern Europeans of the era. The painter has taken a number of liberties with representation to accentuate the features of his wife. Her head is out of proportion to her body, and her forehead unusually and fashionably high, a device which allows the artist to concentrate on the facial features of his wife. In addition, the geometric pattern formed by her head-dress, arms and the V of her neck-line allows her face to dominate the image.\r The couple likely married around 1432\u201333, soon after his move to Bruges - she is unmentioned before he relocated while the first of their two children was born in 1434. Very little is known of Margaret, even her maiden name is lost - contemporary records refer to her mainly as Damoiselle Marguierite. She is thought to have been of aristocratic birth, though from the lower nobility, evidenced from her clothes in this portrait which are fashion but not of the sumptuousness worn by the bride in van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait. The fabrics and colours worn by people of the 15th century were informally regulated by their social position; for example black, an expensive dye, could only be worn by the upper reaches of society. As the widow of a renowned painter, Margaret was afforded a modest pension by the city of Bruges after Jan's death. It is recorded that at least some of this income was invested in lottery.\n", "\nArtist: Jan van Eyck\nArtwork Name: The Madonna in the Church\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-eyck/the-madonna-in-the-church-1439\n\nWikipedia Article:\nMadonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) is a small oil panel by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably executed between c. 1438\u201340, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips the hem of her red dress in a manner that recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch at the rear of the nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.\r Most art historians see the panel as the left wing of a dismantled diptych; presumably its opposite wing was a votive portrait. Near-contemporary copies by the Master of 1499 and Jan Gossaert pair it with two very different right-hand images: one is of a donor kneeling in an interior setting; the other is set outdoors, with the donor being presented by St Anthony. Both painters made significant alterations to van Eyck's composition, which may have brought the image more up to date with contemporary styles, but the copies have been described as \"spiritually if not aesthetically disastrous to the original concept\".\r Madonna in the Church was first documented in 1851. Since then its dating and attribution have been widely debated amongst scholars. At first thought an early work by Jan van Eyck, and for a period attributed to his brother Hubert van Eyck, it is now definitively attributed to Jan and believed to be a later work, demonstrating techniques present in work from the mid-1430s and later. The panel was acquired for the Berlin Gem\u00e4ldegalerie in 1874. It was stolen in 1877 and soon returned, but without its original inscribed frame, which was never recovered. Today Madonna in the Church is widely considered one of van Eyck's finest; Millard Meiss wrote that its \"splendor and subtlety of [its depiction] of light is unsurpassed in Western art.\"\r The attribution of the panel reflects the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on Early Netherlandish art. It is now thought to have been completed c. 1438\u201340, but there are still arguments for dates as early as 1424\u201329. As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, the panel was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in the 1875 Gem\u00e4ldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim by art historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.\n", "\nArtist: Petrus Christus\nArtwork Name: Potrait of a Carthusian\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/petrus-christus/potrait-of-a-carthusian-1446\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of a Carthusian is a painting in oils on oak panel by the Early Netherlandish painter Petrus Christus in 1446. The work is part of the Jules Bache Collection housed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\r It is regarded as a masterpiece of Early Netherlandish painting and a prominent, early example of Trompe l\u2019oeil.\r Portrait of a Carthusian depicts a three-quarter portrait of anonymous Carthusian monk captured in mid-turn, gazing directly at the viewer. Because the monk\u2019s body is turned to his left, he must look over his right shoulder to gaze at the viewer, creating a somewhat cumbersome diagonal pose. Petrus Christus balances this out by shifting the axis of the monk\u2019s face to the right, placing him just off center. By further modeling the monk\u2019s right shoulder more than his left shoulder, Christus draws one side of the body closer to the viewer, adding more depth to the work. The proportions of the monk\u2019s face have also been exaggerated; the nose and eyes having been purposefully elongated. The overall effect is something of an exaggerated silhouette, a compositional technique not often found in Early Netherlandish Painting.\r The lighting scheme employed by Petrus Christus is also noteworthy. The Monk is bathed in intense light, setting his figure dramatically against the space that he occupies. While this strong, raking light is typical of contemporaries like Jan van Eyck, Christus\u2019 addition of a second, opposing lighting source behind the monk marks this portrait as distinctive. The light on the left seems to be a reflection from within the room, yet the light bathing the monk seems to be coming from an external source, perhaps an unseen window. The result is that light comes from both in and outside the pictorial space, with the monk (particularly along the hood of his cloak) being the meeting point of the two. The monk is therefore framed by a two-source lighting structure, allowing Christus to employ a much fuller and richer spectrum of colors and shading than a single-source lighting structure would. This complex lighting scheme is the reason Portrait of a Carthusian appears fully 3-dimensional and realistic.\r Portrait of a Carthusian sports a Trompe-l'\u0153il fly on the center of its lower frame. The addition of Trompe l\u2019oeil flies to works of art is believed to have begun in the 15th century, right as Christus became active. Art Historians are generally split between two different interpretations of their use. Many art historians believe the fly to hold religious symbolism, functions as connotations of sin, corruption, mortality, etc. Art historians believe that a fly was used to evoke such images in connection with Satan\u2019s moniker Beelzebub\u2014the Lord of the Flies. More recently, art historians are beginning to view the inclusion of Trompe l\u2019oeil flies as a professional calling card, with art historian Felix Th\u00fclemann describing it as \u201ca selfconscious representation of superior painterly prowess. It is believed that this is why the fly generally appears next to the artist\u2019s signature (the fly\u2019s position right next to \u2018Petrus \u03a7\u03a1\u0399 Me Fecit\u2019 hinting that the fly might be the referent of \u2018me\u2019 rather than the painting.)\n", "\nArtist: Petrus Christus\nArtwork Name: St. Eligius as a goldsmith showing a ring to the engaged couple\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/petrus-christus/st-eligius-as-a-goldsmith-showing-a-ring-to-the-engaged-couple-1449\n\nWikipedia Article:\nA Goldsmith in His Shop, Possibly Saint Eligius is a 1449 painting by Petrus Christus, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\r The main figure in the painting was long thought to be Saint Eligius, the patron saint of goldsmiths, due to the presence of a halo.

Unusually innovative and dramatic for its time, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child as she stands on a disembodied dead tree trunk, surrounded by the circular briars of a crown of thorns.\r The painting is believed to allude to the Book of Ezekiel, with the tree symbolizing the Tree of Knowledge from the Garden of Eden. However, Christus portrays the tree as dead and withered, with flowers blooming on its branches with the birth of Christ. The golden letters hanging from the branches of the tree are thought to represent the first letters of the Angelic Salutation, the Ave Maria. The Baby Jesus is presented as holding an orb crowned with a cross. The iconography is drawn from the Confraternity of Our Lady of the Dry Tree in Bruges, which both Christus and his wife, Gaudicine, were members of.\r Mary is dressed in a long red robe with a green lining, the folds deeply cut in an almost sculptural manner. Her robe closely resembles that of the Madonna in Christus's Exeter Madonna of c. 1444, leading to speculation that the work is from an earlier period than the assumed 1462-65. Unusually for a Madonna of the time, her face is largely unidealised, the features less soft or rounded, and her expression less presupposing than in his later Madonnas or even secular female portraits.\r The representation of Christ seems derived from Rogier van der Weyden, especially in the playfulness and amiability of Christ's facial expression, although given that Christus might not have had access to the older master's work, the influence may be second-hand, through the panels of Hans Memling. The panel is highly illustionistic, perhaps on par with the older painter's Dur\u00e1n Madonna. Christus employs trompe-l'\u0153il techniques in a number of passages, creating a three-dimensional effect that adds to the strangeness and disembodied atmosphere. These can be most notably seen in the Virgin's hand as it lies below the child's toes, in the orb held in his hands, and in the golden letters hanging from the tree briars.\r X-radiograph reveals little preparatory underdrawing outside of a series of ruled lines used to situate elements within the overall design. Maryan Ainsworth notes that this is typical of Christus's smaller panels, some which \u2013 including this work \u2013 could be considered miniatures, and compares it to the techniques used in contemporary illuminated manuscripts.\r Art historian Grete Ring identified the iconography of the work as belonging to the Bruges confraternity of \"Our Lady of the Dry Tree\" of which Christus was a member, also known as the \"Confraternity of Our Lady of the Snow\". The confraternity attracted members of the upper echelon of Burgundian society; Philip the Good's wife Isabella of Portugal was a member as were most of the leading Burgundian nobles, the leading upper-class families and the leading foreign traders of Bruges. Christus joined \u2013 for the same reason Gerard David would some years later - to attract wealthy patrons, sometime between 1458 and 1463.\n", "\nArtist: Petrus Christus\nArtwork Name: Portrait of a Young Girl\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: tempera,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/petrus-christus/portrait-of-a-young-girl\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of a Young Girl is a small oil-on-oak panel painting by the Early Netherlandish painter Petrus Christus. It was completed towards the end of his life, between 1465 and 1470, and is held in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin. It marks a major stylistic advance in contemporary portraiture; the girl is set in an airy, three-dimensional, realistic setting, and stares out at the viewer with a complicated expression that is reserved, yet intelligent and alert.\r It is widely regarded as one of the most exquisite portraits of the Northern Renaissance. Art historian Joel Upton described the sitter as resembling \"a polished pearl, almost opalescent, lying on a cushion of black velvet.\" The panel builds on the work of Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, and was highly influential in the decades after its completion. Its appeal lies in part in her intriguing stare, accentuated by the slight misalignment of her eyes, while the eyebrows are faintly skewed.\r Christus frames his sitter in a rigid and balanced architectural setting. She is positioned within a narrow rectangular space, before a wainscotted wall. The image is divided by the horizontal parallel lines of her wainscot and blouse, which join at the inverted triangle formed by the neckline of her dress. The rendering of the background departs somewhat from contemporary conventions in portraiture: Christus sets the girl against a dark brown wall with little detail, in contrast to the elaborate interiors of Jan van Eyck, who is often regarded as Christus' master. It is defined entirely by its material, a wooden dado rail along the top and the wainscot that forms the lower portion. The wall sets her in a realistic interior, perhaps intended to represent a space within her home.\r Light falls on the pictorial space from the left, creating shadows against the back wall, the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow on the wall behind the girl and acts as a counterpoint to the contour of her cheek and hairline.\r The girl has pale skin, almond and slightly oriental eyes and a petulant mouth. She reflects the Gothic ideal of elongated facial features, narrow shoulders, tightly pinned hair and an almost unnaturally long forehead, achieved through tightly pulled-back hair which has been plucked at the top. She is dressed in expensive clothing and jewellery and seems to be uncommonly elegant. She looks out of the canvas in an oblique but self-aware and penetrating manner that some art historians have described as unnerving. Joanna Woods-Marsden remarks that a sitter acknowledging her audience in this way was virtually unprecedented even in Italian portrait painting. Her acknowledgment is accentuated by the painting's crop, which focuses the viewer's gaze in a near-invasive manner that seems to question the relationship between artist, model, patron and viewer.\r The headdress is a variant of the truncated or bee-hive hennin, then fashionable at the Burgundian court. A very similar style, with no tail, is seen on the older of two girls in the donor panels of Presentation of Christ by the Master of the Prado Adoration of the Magi, a pupil of Rogier van der Weyden. The black band under the chin is rarely found in other images from the period, and has been interpreted as a style borrowed from the male chaperon hat, which always has a long tailing tail or cornette, sometimes worn wrapped under the chin in this way.\n", "\nArtist: Hans Memling\nArtwork Name: Portrait of an Old Woman\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling/portrait-of-an-old-woman-1470\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of an Old Woman is a small oil on wood panel painting by the Early Netherlandish painter Hans Memling, completed c 1475\u201380, and in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas, since 1944. The panel has obviously been cut down given its tight framing. The woman's face and headdress dominate the remaining pictorial space; they create a strong contrast between her cream headgear and the black background and the lower portion of the painting, which was originally bluish green, but has darkened with age and accumulated dirt. Yet the panel is in good condition following a restoration that replaced lost paint in several areas.\r The panel is noted for it dramatic contrasts in light and colour, and for its subtle treatment of skin tones, which are comparable to Memling's c 1472 Portrait of Maria Portinari, in New York.\r The painting was obviously at one time a donor wing, either for a diptych or triptych which was at some stage broken apart. It is probably thus related to the Portrait of an Elderly Man now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. That painting's commission is unclear; we do know who he was, and his hands are folded rather than joined in prayer, the vastly usual positing for a donor panel.\r The painting was in Paris in 1910, when it was sold to C. von Hollitscher of Berlin. From there it passed into the von Auspitz collection in Vienna until 1931. It was acquired by the art dealer Bachstitz who sold it to Percy S. Straus in 1934.

The painting shows 23 vignettes of the Life of Christ combined in one narrative composition without a central dominating scene: 19 episodes from the Passion of Christ, the Resurrection, and 3 later appearances of the risen Christ (to Mary Magdalene, on the road to Emmaus, and at the Sea of Galilee). The painting was commissioned by Tommaso Portinari, an Italian banker based in Bruges, who is depicted in a donor portrait kneeling and praying in the lower left corner, with his wife, Maria Baroncelli, in a similar attitude in the lower right corner.\r The painting is relatively small, 56.7 \u00d7 92.2\u00a0cm, and is unlikely to have been an altarpiece. It may have been intended for Portinari's chapel in the church of St Jacob in Bruges. It was not catalogued in Portinari's belongings when he died in 1501, and is thought to have been moved from Bruges to Florence between 1510 and 1520. It is first recorded in the collection of Cosimo I in Florence in 1550. The painting is now held by the Galleria Sabauda in Turin.\r The scenes of the Passion start in the distance at the top left with Jesus's entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, passes through the town and out again to the bottom left to the Garden of Gethsemane, through the Passion scenes in the centre of the city (judgment of Pilate, the Flagellation of Jesus, Crowning with Thorns, Ecce Homo), then follows the procession of the cross back out of the city to the bottom right, then up to the top for the crucifixion, and ending in the distance at the top right with the appearances at Emmaus and Galilee. It includes seven of the traditional 14 Stations of the Cross, but adds several scenes before and after them, and omits 7: Jesus being given his cross, two occasions when Jesus falls carrying the cross, Jesus meeting his mother, Veronica wiping the face of Jesus, Jesus meeting the daughters of Jerusalem, and Jesus being stripped of his garments.\r The scenes are distributed in and around an idealized Jerusalem, depicted as a walled medieval city with exotic towers topped by domes. The high \"birds-eye\" point of view makes Calvary visible behind the city.

It was commissioned in the mid-1470s in Bruges for the Old St. John's Hospital (Sint-Janshospitaal) during the building of a new apse. It is signed and dated 1479 on the original frame \u2013 its date of installation \u2013 and is today at the hospital in the Memling museum.\r The altarpiece consists of five paintings\u00a0\u2013 a central inner panel and two double-sided wings. Those on the reverse of wings are visible when the shutters are closed, and show the hospital donors flanked by their patron saints. The interior has a central panel with the enthroned Virgin and Child flanked by saints; the left wing features episodes from the life of John the Baptist with emphasis on his beheading; the right wing shows the apocalypse as recorded by John the Evangelist, pictured writing on the island of Patmos.\r St John Altarpiece is one of Memling's more ambitious works, and shares near-identical scenes with two other works: the Donne Triptych, in London's National Gallery, and the Virgin and Child with Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\r Hans Memling purchased citizenship in Bruges in late January 30, which suggests he was a recent arrival to the city. He probably came from Brussels where he had been apprenticed to Rogier van der Weyden. In Bruges he established himself as a painter fairly quickly. Although it appears he was absent from the city for Charles the Bold and Margaret of York's extravagant 1468 wedding celebration, art historian James Weale speculates Memling might have gone to England to execute a bridal portrait, commissioned either by Charles the Bold or his father Philip the Good. According to Weale, Memling's position in Bruges was secured by the Dukes of Burgundy.\r Old St. John's Hospital (Sint-Janshospitaal) was one of four public hospitals in the city; one took in lepers, one paupers, and two \u2013 including St John's \u2013 treated men, women and children. Established in the late 12th century, it was dedicated to John the Evangelist; at an unknown later date the dedication was extended to include John the Baptist. The Bruges civic authorities financed the hospital and oversaw its direction until the 1440s when a fiscal crisis caused them to decrease funding and increase their supervision. At that time, the hospital brothers and sisters placed themselves under the authority of the Bishop of Tournai, Jean Chevrot, and directly aligned themselves with Philip the Good on whose council Chevrot sat. By the 1470s the hospital masters and bursars not only averted bankruptcy, but accrued a surplus to spend on expansion.\r The altarpiece was probably commissioned in the mid-1470s for the new apse, and almost certainly completed in 1479. The central frame is inscribed in Latin and reads; OPUS. IOHANNES MEMLING. ANNO. M. CCCC. LXXIX, The date gives clues to the donors on the exterior panels; and because one died in 1475, scholars are confident in a start date before that year. Memling probably began work on the piece as early as 1473, when plans were made to extend the already large 240-bed infirmary, which, with two patients per bed, served about 500 people. As at the Hospices de Beaune, patients in Sint-Janshospitaal could follow the Liturgy of the Hours from their beds.\n", "\nArtist: Hans Memling\nArtwork Name: Portrait of a Man holding a coin of the Emperor Nero\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling/portrait-of-a-man-holding-a-coin-of-the-emperor-nero-1474\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of a Man with a Roman Medal is a painting by the German-born Flemish artist Hans Memling, dating to c. 1480 and housed in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp, Belgium.

In the left hand, he is showing a Roman medal of emperor Nero, a symbol of his attention to Humanism. In the background is a lake landscape: Memling was one of the first painters to use natural landscapes for backgrounds of portraits (instead of the traditional black one), influencing later Renaissance artists such as Sandro Botticelli and Pietro Perugino.   The identity of the subject is unknown. It has been supposed that he could be one of the numerous Italians living at the time in Antwerp or Bruges, who often commissioned artworks to local painters.

The panel shows an enthroned Virgin holding the Child. St Catherine of Alexandria and St Barbara are seated alongside. Angels playing instruments flank the throne, while the left hand male figure is presumably the donor. The scene is set before a landscape.\r Intended as a devotional donor portrait, the panel combines elements of a Hortus conclusus, sacra conversazione and Virgo inter Virgines \u2013 the latter of which always presents Mary with Saints Catherine and Barbara. The work is characteristic of Memling's serene style, with structure and colors in harmony. The painting reflects techniques Memling probably learned from his predecessors Rogier van der Weyden, to whom he was almost certainly apprenticed, and Jan van Eyck, synthesizing elements of the earlier artists' work.\r The composition is an almost exact copy of Memling's central panel in the St John Altarpiece. It is unknown when Memling painted the Mystic Marriage; 1480 seems a probable date according to tree ring analysis. The arbor arching over the Virgin's throne was added at a later date, probably in the 16th century.\r The painting depicts the Virgin and Child flanked by saints and angels; the donor kneels to the left of the holy figures. The Virgin sits on a throne beneath a baldachin (canopy of honor) of rich brocade with the child on her lap. In the garden behind her emblem, an iris, is visible. Two angels dressed in liturgical garments with musical instruments stand to either side of the throne; the one to the left plays a portable organ and the one on right plays a harp. The martyr virgin saint, St Catherine of Alexandria kneels in front of Mary to the left; opposite is St Barbara, who sits to the right, reading a missal. The donor kneels behind St Catherine, a set of rosary beads in his hands. Attached to his hip, barely visible, is either a small purse or a coat-of-arms.\r St Catherine was highly venerated in the Middle Ages, second only in popularity to the Magdelen. Emperor Maxentius tortured Catherine on an iron-spiked wheel and later, when she proclaimed herself married to Christ, cut off her head. According to her legend the mystic marriage occurred in a dream from which she awoke with a ring on her finger. Her emblems are the breaking wheel and sword, seen in the foreground, peeking out from beneath the voluminous folds of her ermine-lined skirt.\r To denote her royal birth, Catherine wears a crown on her head and is dressed in rich clothing \u2013 a white tabard, red velvet sleeves, and a richly patterned brocade skirt. She extends her left hand to the Christ Child who places the ring on her finger, symbolizing their spiritual or mystical betrothal.

According to the art historian Maryan Ainsworth, the work is a \"startlingly original image, rich in connotations for the viewer or worshiper\".\r The iconography focuses on the Virgin's purity. Her swoon foreshadows the Crucifixion of Jesus, and the panel emphasises her role as mother, bride and Queen of Heaven. The original frame survived until the 19th century and was inscribed with a date believed to be 1482; modern art historians suggested the number's final digit was a nine, which would give a date of 1489. In 1847 Gustav Friedrich Waagen described it as one of Memling's \"finest and most original works\". In 1902 it was exhibited in Bruges at the Exposition des primitifs flamands \u00e0 Bruges, after which it underwent cleaning and restoration. Philip Lehman bought it in 1920 from the Radziwi\u0142\u0142 family who may have had it in their family since the 16th century; Antoni Radziwi\u0142\u0142 discovered it on a family estate in the early 19th century. At that time it had been pierced through with an arrow and required restoration.\r The Annunciation was a popular theme in late medieval European art, Mary acts as Theotokos, the God-bearer as affirmed in 431 at the Council of Ephesus; two decades later the Council of Chalcedon affirmed the doctrine of Incarnation\u00a0\u2013 that Christ was of two natures (God and Man)\u00a0\u2013 and her perpetual virginity was affirmed at the Lateran Council of 631. In Byzantine art, Annunciation scenes depict the Virgin enthroned and dressed in royal regalia. In later centuries she was shown in enclosed spaces: the temple, the church, the garden.\r In Early Netherlandish art the Annunciation is typically set in contemporary domestic interiors, a motif and tradition established by Robert Campin, and followed by Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden. Neither Campin nor van Eyck went so far as to set the scene in a bedchamber, although the motif is found in van der Weyden's c.\u00a01435 Louvre Annunciation and c.\u00a01455 Saint Columba altarpiece in which the Virgin kneels by the nuptial bed, rendered in red made from costly pigments. Memling's depiction is nearly identical to van der Weyden's Columba Altarpiece.\r The archangel Gabriel appears before Mary to announce that she will bear the Son of God. He is shown standing in a three-quarter view wearing a small jeweled diadem and dressed in vestments. He has a richly embroidered red-and-gold brocade cope, edged with a pattern of gray seraphim and wheels, over a white alb and amice. He holds his staff of office in one hand, and raises the other towards the Virgin. He bends his knees, honoring and acknowledging her as Mother of Christ and Queen of Heaven, and his feet are bare and positioned slightly behind hers.\n", "\nArtist: Hans Memling\nArtwork Name: Madonna and Child, from The Diptych of Maerten van Nieuwenhove\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling/madonna-and-child-from-the-diptych-of-maerten-van-nieuwenhove-1487\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Diptych of Maarten van Nieuwenhove is a 1487 painting by Hans Memling, showing on the left side the Virgin and Child, and on the right side Maarten van Nieuwenhove. It is now kept in the Old St. John's Hospital in Bruges. It is unsigned, but has invariably been attributed to Hans Memling since the middle of the 19th century.\r The painting is an early example of an Early Netherlandish devotional diptych, which still preserves the original frame and hinges. A new invention was showing the scene in a continuous room, instead of against a monochrome background.\r The window at the upper left originally was clear glass, showing a landscape. The composition was changed at a later stage to show the coat of arms of Van Nieuwenhove here instead. It was more common to have this on the outer panels than this prominently. It is surrounded by four images of a hand sowing seeds, a pun on the name of the donor which means \"from the new garden\". The same coat of arms can also be seen on the clasp of the book in front of Van Nieuwenhove.\r The mirror behind Mary shows the scene in reverse, making it even more explicit that the two panels are placed in the same room and time, even though the actual configuration seen in the mirror does not match the scene in the main painting. Memling only included the mirror in a later stage of the composition. This unity of space was also emphasized by small details like the carpet to the left of Mary, which reappears beneath the hands of van Nieuwenhove. The work was probably intended to be displayed with the two panels at an angle, but it is uncertain how exactly they should be placed. One possibility is that it was intended to be hung from a wall or column, with the Virign panel fixed and the van Nieuwenhove panel loose.\r The inscription at the bottom of the two panels reads \"HOC OPUS FIERI FECIT MARTINUS DE NEWENHOVEN ANNO DM 1487 - ANO VERO ETATIS SUE 23\" meaning \"Maarten van Nieuwenhove had this work made in 1487\" (left panel) and \"At the age of 23\" (right panel).\r The glass panels in the windows depict Saint Christopher and Saint George (above the Virgin and Child) and Saint Martin of Tours (as his namesake saint) above Maarten van Nieuwenhove. Through the open window, one can see the Minnewater, a romantic corner of Bruges.\r Maarten van Nieuwenhove (11 November 1463 - 16 August 1500) came from a noble family of Bruges with connections at the court of Burgundy. In the 1490s, Van Nieuwenhove was successively a city councilor, the captain of the civic guard, and in 1498 mayor of Bruges.\n", "\nArtist: Hans Memling\nArtwork Name: St. Ursula Shrine: Medallions\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling/st-ursula-shrine-medallions-1489\n\nWikipedia Article:\nTexte en italique\r The Shrine of St. Ursula is a carved and gilded wooden reliquary containing oil on panel inserts (87x33x91 cm) by Hans Memling. Dating to c. 1489, is housed in the Hans Memling Museum in the Old St. John's Hospital (Sint-Janshospitaal), Bruges in the Flemish Region of modern-day Belgium.\r The work was commissioned by the Hospital of St. John, the current museum's seat. Differently from other works by Memling, such as the Triptych of the Mystical Marriage of St. Catherine or the Florens Triptych, it is neither signed nor dated. It was a container for Saint Ursula's relics which was shown publicly only in her feast day. The relics were solemnly put in the shrine on 21 November 1489.\r The shrine is in the shape of a Gothic chapel, according to a scheme already used in goldsmith. It has a steeply pointed cover, as typical of northern European countries, with three painted tondoes on each side. Attributed to Memling's workshop, they depict, on one side, the First Eleven Virgins with the Pope, a Cardinal, a Bishop and Etherius (characters of the saint's legend); on the other side, the Coronation of the Virgin with the Holy Trinity.\r The two \"fa\u00e7ades\" contain the representations of the Virgin and Child between Two Nuns (the two donors, including the abbess), and St. Ursula Protecting the Holy Virgins. Both the scenes are embedded within a painted niche which simulates a perspective interior of the shrine.\r At the sides, under two small arcades, are six scenes of the life and martyrdom of St. Ursula, which resemble the style of the stained glasses in contemporary churches. They include:\r The scenes share the same pictorial background, set in northern German cities (such as Cologne, with the unfinished Cathedral) and painted with great attention to today's life details.\r The decoration is completed by the carvings in International Gothic style, including pinnacles, holed friezes and, on the piers at the corners, the saints James, John the Evangelist, Agnes and Elizabeth of Hungary.\n", "\nArtist: Hugo van der Goes\nArtwork Name: Portinari Triptych\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hugo-van-der-goes/portinari-triptych-1478\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portinari Altarpiece or Portinari Triptych (c. 1475) is an oil on wood triptych painting by the Flemish painter Hugo van der Goes representing the Adoration of the Shepherds. It measures 253 x 304\u00a0cm, and is now in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence, Italy.\r The work was commissioned for the church of the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence by the Italian banker Tommaso Portinari, a descendent of the hospital's founder. Portinari lived for more than forty years in Bruges as a representative for the Medici family's bank. Portinari himself is depicted on the left panel with his two sons Antonio and Pigello; his wife Maria di Francesco Baroncelli is shown on the right panel with their daughter Margarita. All, except Pigello, are accompanied by their patron saints: Saint Thomas (with the spear), Saint Anthony (with the bell), Mary Magdalen (with the pot of ointment) and Saint Margaret (with the book and the dragon).\r In the central panel, three shepherds fall to their knees before the child Jesus. Van der Goes painted these rustic characters very realistically. Kneeling angels surround the Virgin and the Child, who is not in a crib but lies on the ground surrounded by an aureole of golden rays. This unusual representation of the adoration of Jesus is probably based on one of the visions of Saint Bridget of Sweden.\r In the background, van der Goes painted scenes related to the main subject: on the left panel, Joseph and Mary on the road to Bethlehem; on the central panel (to the right), the shepherds visited by the angel; on the right panel, the Three Magi on the road to Bethlehem.\r When the work arrived in Florence in 1483, it was installed in the Portinari family chapel where it was deeply admired by the Italian artists who saw it, many of whom sought to emulate it. A good example is the Adoration of the Shepherds (1485) which Domenico Ghirlandaio painted in the Sassetti Chapel in the church of Santa Trinita in Florence. However, the naturalistic depiction of the shepherds is already present in Andrea Mantegna's Adoration of the Shepherds (Metropolitan Museum, New York), which dates from around 1450.\n", "\nArtist: Hugo van der Goes\nArtwork Name: The Trinity Altar Panels\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hugo-van-der-goes/the-trinity-altar-panels-1478\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Trinity Altarpiece, also known as the Trinity Altar Panels, is a set of four paintings in oil on wood thought to have been commissioned for the Trinity College Kirk in Edinburgh, Scotland, in the late fifteenth century.\r The work is attributed to the Flemish artist Hugo van der Goes and probably represents the inner and outer panels of the wings of a triptych.

It was used by the town burghers to encourage honesty among the magistrates and as a symbolic public apology for the imprisonment of Maximilian I in Bruges in 1488.

The marriage of Charles and Anne had been celebrated in December 1491, less than a year before the Dauphin's birth. It had begun unhappily, with the new Queen resenting the marriage forced upon her and the political dominance of her sister-in-law, Anne, Duchess of Bourbon. Her pregnancy was thus greeted with special joy by her, as well as by the King and the people, for the depleted elder branch of the House of Valois depended on a male heir. Accordingly, Anne spent her pregnancy at ease, given the devoted attention of her husband who ensured that she would not be tired out or subject to unnecessary travel. In the autumn of 1492, the King and Queen went to the ch\u00e2teau of Plessis-l\u00e8s-Tours where all was prepared for the birth of the hoped-for boy.  The Queen went into labour on the night of 10 October and was swiftly attended to by the royal doctors and midwives.  With her was Charles who, much to the annoyance of those around, soon lost his calm due to anxiety.  However, all went well, and at 4 o'clock in the morning, the Queen gave birth to a robust and well-formed boy who was automatically Dauphin of France.  The Dauphin was immediately the subject of controversy. His parents and his godmother, Jeanne de Laval, widow of King Ren\u00e9 I of Naples, wanted to name him Orlando (French: Orland), after Roland, the Carolingian hero of The Song of Roland whose name was rendered thus in Italian. The name had been suggested to them by Fran\u00e7ois of Paule, a hermit and preacher in whom they had confidence.  However, the godfathers (Louis, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, next in line for the throne, and Peter II, Duke of Bourbon) flatly refused to allow a future king of France to be given such a foreign name and begged for him to be named instead after his ancestors: Louis, Philippe or Charles.  Finally, after three days of dispute, a compromise was reached: the Dauphin would be named Charles Orland in the French language, and Orlandus Carolus in Latin. This settled, the baptism was held on 13 October. The Dauphin, clad in cloth of gold, was carried into the Church of Saint Jean of Plessisour by John IV of Chalon-Arlay, Prince of Orange and was baptised in the font there, surrounded by the greatest lords of the Court, each holding the candle, the basin or the towel. During the ceremony, Charles VIII held the hand of Fran\u00e7ois of Paule, who led the ceremony and blessed Charles Orlando. Anne of Brittany, still recovering, was not in attendance.  Described by the chronicler Philippe de Commines as a \"beautiful child and daring in word, not fearing the things that the other children are accustomed to fear\", Charles Orlando was a healthy and vigorous child, who grew well and strong, a fluent speaker by age 3. He had a fair complexion, black eyes and was chubby. When he reached the age of 18 months, he was installed in Amboise, monitored by two governors, the lords de Boisy and That-Gu\u00e9nant, a governess, Madame de Bussi\u00e8re, and surrounded by a multitude of servants. He was the pride and joy of his parents. His mother doted on him, buying him presents; his father described him as the \"most beautiful of gems\". Both insisted on being kept informed of his health and his progress, by means of letters and messages.\n", "\nArtist: Peter Paul Rubens\nArtwork Name: Self-Portrait in a Circle of Friends from Mantua\nArtwork Genre: self-portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/peter-paul-rubens/self-portrait-in-a-circle-of-friends-from-mantua-1602\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSelf-portrait in a circle of friends from Mantua is an oil on canvas by Peter Paul Rubens, produced between 1602 and 1605.

It dates from about 1609 to 1610. Two preliminary copies of the painting also exist today: an ink and wash drawing on paper, and an oil sketch on wood panel. The oil sketch is currently on display in the Cincinnati Art Museum, while the ink sketch is being held in a private collection in Amsterdam.\r The painting depicts an episode from the Old Testament story of Samson and Delilah (Judges 16). Samson was a Hebrew hero known for fighting the Philistines. Having fallen in love with Delilah, who has been bribed by the Philistines, Samson tells her the secret of his great strength: his uncut hair. Without his strength, Samson is captured by the Philistines.\r Rubens portrays the moment when, having fallen asleep on Delilah's lap, a young man cuts Samson's hair. Samson and Delilah are in a dark room, which is lit mostly by a candle held by an old woman to Delilah's left. Delilah is depicted with all of her clothes, but with her breasts exposed. Her left hand is on top of Samson's right shoulder, as his left arm is draped over her legs. The man snipping Samson's hair is crossing his hands, which is a sign of betrayal. Philistine soldiers can be seen in the right-hand background of the painting.\r The niche behind Delilah contains a statue of the Venus, the Goddess of love, and her son, Cupid. Notably, Cupid's mouth is bound, rather than his eyes. This statue can be taken to represent the cause of Samson's fate and the tool of Delilah's actions.\r The old woman standing behind Delilah, providing further light for the scene, does not appear in the biblical narrative of Samson and Delilah. She is believed to be a procuress, and the adjacent profiles of her and Delilah may symbolise the old woman's past, and Delilah's future.\r The painting was originally commissioned by Nicolaas II Rockox, Lord mayor of Antwerp, Belgium, for his Rockox House. In addition to being a patron, Rockox was a close personal friend of Rubens. The painting was specifically intended to be placed above a 7-foot mantleshelf, where the painting would have been seen from below.\r The painting was publicly sold for charity when Rockox died in 1640, but it is unknown who the painting was sold to. In 1700, a panel named Samson and Delilah was bought by Prince Johann Adams Andreas I. This painting was likely Rubens' painting. However, when the painting was part of the Liechtenstein Collection in Vienna, Austria in the eighteenth century, the painter was identified as Jan van den Hoecke, who was a principal assistant of Rubens in the 1630s. The painting was then sold in 1880 in Paris, where it was later found by Ludwig Burchard in 1929. Eventually, the painting sold at auction in 1980 at Christie's, purchased by the National Gallery, London for $5 million.\r There has been some doubt cast over the attribution of the painting to Rubens, led by the artist and scholar of Fayum portraits Euphronsyne Doxiades. She argues that it varies in details from copies of the original made during Rubens' lifetime, that it does not employ the layering technique of glazing common in oil painting at the time and mastered by Rubens, and that its provenance can not be documented with certainty between 1641 and 1929.

The second reproduction was completed by Ruebens around 1638.\r Peter Paul Rubens painted the triptych The Elevation of the Cross after returning to Flanders from Italy. The work shows the clear influence of Italian Renaissance and Baroque artists such as Caravaggio, Tintoretto and Michelangelo. The central panel illustrates a tension between the multitude of massively muscled men attempting to lift the cross and the seemingly unbearable weight of Christ on the cross.\r Peter Paul Rubens' foreshortening is evident in the contortions of the struggling, strapping men. Christ cuts across the central panel in a diagonal, stylistically akin to Caravaggio's Entombment where both descent and ascent are in play at a key moment. Motion, space and time are illustrated along with the struggle to upright the cross. Rubens uses dynamic color and chiaroscuro boldly, a style that would become more subtle with time.\r The triptych painting is located at the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp, Belgium, along with other Rubens works. It was commissioned by the church to express their allegiance with Catholicism, after the split of the Protestants. Under Napoleon's rule, the emperor took the painting, along with Peter Paul Rubens' The Descent from the Cross, to Paris. The paintings were returned to the cathedral in 1815.\r The Elevation of the Cross is also the title of a smaller oil on paper painting reproduction of the triptych painting. Also painted by Ruebens, he completed the piece around 1638, and it was given given to Hans Witdoeck, to use as a modello. The smaller painting is unique from the original, however, with the addition of color accents throughout the composition. Due to its size, some have suggested the painting may have been conceived as an independent painting to The Elevation of the Cross, to be given as a personal gift to Cornelis van der Geest. The painting is presently a part of the Art Gallery of Ontario's permanent collection, after it was purchased from George Holford in 1928.\n", "\nArtist: Peter Paul Rubens\nArtwork Name: St. George and a Dragon\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/peter-paul-rubens/st-george-and-a-dragon-1610\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint George and the Dragon is a painting by Peter Paul Rubens (c. 1605-07), based upon the motif with the same name.\r It was painted in Genoa (Saint George is the patron of this city) while Rubens was in Italy to complete his artistic training on behalf of his mentor at the time, Otto van Veen. Many scholars speculate the work was originally commissioned for the Church of Sant\u2019Ambrogio, which was dedicated to Saint George. If so, the commissioner never received the masterpiece, due to the artist holding on to his work until he died in 1640, where Felipe IV procured the piece. It is currently housed in the Museo del Prado of Madrid. \r In the painting the princess represents the church as a whole, and the lamb she is grasping represents the innocence and purity of the church, and Saint George and his steed symbolize the triumph of good over evil as the Saint George stares the beast down from literally \u201con high\u201d. To reiterate, Saint George\u2019s right foot prominently highlighted above the dragon signifies that the dragon (darkness, devil, evil) is in every way beneath Saint George and the light that envelops him and the princess. In opposition, the dragon\u2019s form, which very much resembles a serpent, rather than the typical lizard, or dinosaur-like depiction of dragons, an allegory to the classic tale of Adam and Eve, where in Satan takes the form of a serpent.\r  Media related to Saint George and the Dragon by Rubens at Wikimedia Commons\n", "\nArtist: Peter Paul Rubens\nArtwork Name: Juno and Argus\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/peter-paul-rubens/juno-and-argus-1611\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJuno and Argus is a 1610 painting by Peter Paul Rubens, showing Juno and Argus.

It is still in its original place, the Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp, Belgium, along with another great altarpiece The Elevation of the Cross. The subject was one Rubens returned to again and again in his career. This particular work was commissioned on September 7, 1611, by the Confraternity of the Arquebusiers, whose Patron Saint was St. Christopher.\r Although essentially Baroque, the oil on panel piece is rooted in the Venetian tradition, and likely influenced by the work of Daniele da Volterra, Federico Barocci and Cigoli, amongst others. In its composition and use of light, the triptych recalls Caravaggio's Roman period.\r Theophile Silvestre wrote, in his \"On Rubens' Descent from the Cross \u2013 1868\":\r \u201cThe principal subject is composed of nine figures: at the top of two ladders, workers are lowering the body of Christ with the aid of a shroud which one of them holds in his teeth, the other in the left hand. Bracing themselves firmly against the arms of the cross, each bends forward to guide the Christ with the hand that is left free while St. John, with one foot on the ladder and his back arched, supports him most energetically. One of Savior\u2019s feet comes to rest on the beautiful shoulder of the Magdalene, grazing her golden hair. Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, placed midway on ladders so as to face each other, form, together with the two workmen in the upper part of the picture, a square of vigorous but plebeian figures. The Virgin, standing at the foot of the sacrificial tree, extends her arms towards her Son; Salome (properly, Mary Cleophas), kneeling, gathers up her robe. On the ground are seen the superscription and a copper basin where the crown of thorns and the nails of the Crucifixion lie in the congealed blood. The crowd, always elated by the spectacle of torture, has departed from Golgotha as daylight fades. After the sacrifice of Calvary, as it is called in Scripture, the sad, dark sky is crossed by a light that illumines the shoulders of the workmen, whose bold posture recalls the composition by Daniele da Volterra\".\r In 1794, Napoleon removed this painting and The Elevation of the Cross and sent them to the Louvre. After his defeat, they were returned to the cathedral in 1815.\r In addition to the original work for Antwerp, Rubens painted two other versions exploring the same theme.\n", "\nArtist: Peter Paul Rubens\nArtwork Name: Battle of the Amazons\nArtwork Genre: battle painting\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/peter-paul-rubens/battle-of-the-amazons-1615\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Battle of the Amazons or Amazonomachia is an oil on wood painting produced around 1615.

It was commissioned in 1615 to decorate Schlei\u00dfheim Palace, along with three other works depicting lion, wolf, and boar hunts. The cycle of paintings were looted from the palace during the Napoleonic Wars. Only the Hippopotamus and Crocodile Hunt was returned to Munich, at which time it was added to the collection that is now the Alte Pinakothek.\r Peter Paul Rubens created the canvas oil painting entitled The Hippopotamus and Crocodile Hunt between 1615\u201316. The hunt takes place on the banks of the Nile, as indicated by a palm tree in the background. As hippopotami and crocodiles were considered dangerous nuisances, their destruction was a duty performed by noblemen. The hunting party comprises three men in orientalizing costume\u2014mounted on Arabian horses, who hunt with lance and sword\u2014and two valets clad in roughly-hewn jerkins\u2014one of whom has been killed by one of the beasts. The enraged hippopotamus tramples the crocodile, as both are attacked by the hunters and hounds. The accurately-rendered physical appearances of the hippopotamus and crocodile contrasts with contemporary renderings and reflect the period's growing interest in empiricism and natural history. It has been suggested that Rubens may have traveled to Rome to view a temporarily-displayed dead hippopotamus preserved in brine prior to the painting of the picture.\r Rubens contributed to the long standing genre of the large hunting scene and his studio produced dozens for aristocratic patrons in the 1610s and 1620s. Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria, commissioned the Hippopotamus and Crocodile Hunt three others depicting lion, wolf, and boar hunts, in 1615 to decorate Schlei\u00dfheim Palace, the summer residence of the Wittelsbach princes. Rubens and his studio produced the four large canvases in Antwerp over the years 1615\u201316. The Wittelsbach collection formed the nucleus of Alte Pinakothek in Munich, the present location of the Hippopotamus and Crocodile Hunt and The Lion Hunt from the same cycle. The cycle of paintings were looted from the palace during the Napoleonic Wars. Only the Hippopotamus and Crocodile Hunt was returned to Munich, at which time it was added to the collection that is now the Alte Pinakothek.\r The complexity of the figure grouping, representation of turbulent motion and violent action, high drama, and brilliant palette are hallmarks of Rubens' style.

It is a fanciful depiction of the Roman festival Veneralia celebrated in honor of Venus Verticordia.\r Rubens thought highly of Titian and made a copy of the Venetian master's The Worship of Venus which remained in Rubens' private collection until his death. Titian's work, in turn, was based on the Imagines of the sophist Philostratus of Lemnos. The Imagines consisted of a series of descriptions of ancient paintings presumably decorating a third-century villa near Naples. In the description entitled Cupids (Erotes), Philostratus portrays a \"swarm\" of cupids in a fragrant garden gathering apples, kissing the apples and throwing them back and forth, engaging in archery using themselves as targets since the arrows are arrows of love, wrestling, and chasing a hare (a symbol of fertility). While the cupids are cavorting, nymphs are attending to a statue of Venus that is garnished with a silver mirror, gilded sandals, and golden brooches. Both Titian and Rubens in his copy depict most of this activity in great detail.\r The fourth book (April) of Ovid's Fasti also served as inspiration for Rubens' The Feast of Venus. The poem describes a women's festival held on April 1 to honor both Venus Verticordia and Fortuna Virilis. Ovid first describes the ritual cleaning and ornamentation of the cult statue of Venus:\r He then narrates why the rite of bathing under boughs of myrtle is sacred and explains that an offering of incense to Fortuna Virilis will make a woman appear more desirable to men:\r Ovid describes the mixture of crushed poppies, milk, and honey that is drunk in honor of Venus's wedding night and gives the reason for the rite - Venus holds the key to a woman's beauty, virtue, and honor:\r He concludes by describing the origins of the festival and Venus's epithet and by reciting a prayer:\r Ovid's Fasti, not always corroborated by other sources, portrays a somewhat conflicted account of the festival that blurs distinctions between class and the rite's purpose. Primarily, the cult was intended to turn a woman's heart from lust (libidine) to chastity (pudicitia) so that she may retain her \"beauty, virtue and good repute.\" However, Ovid did not include only brides and mothers in his account. In the second line of his poem, he specifies \"you who must not wear the headbands and long robes\". This is a euphemistic reference to prostitutes (meretrices) who were not allowed to wear the hairstyle and clothes of a respectable matron. Instead, they wore a short tunic and toga. Prostitutes were not being asked to embrace chastity, so their participation must have served other purposes.\r Rubens combined key elements of Imagines and Fasti along with details of his own invention to create a spirited allegory of conjugal bliss where \"voluptuous sensuality is joined and enhanced by the propriety of marriage.\"\r A statue of Venus Verticordia in a pudica pose is the focal point of the work. She is surrounded by attendants who, in turn, are encircled by dancing and cavorting cupids, satyrs, nymphs, and maenads. Rubens includes all three of Ovid's classes of women in his work. The well-clothed matrons are shown performing rites. One washes the statue while the other, in an attitude of prayer, offers incense from a flaming tripod to Fortuna Virilis. The sea of dancing cupids has momentarily parted to allow two eager brides bearing dolls as offerings to rush to the goddess. The prostitutes are also present. Naked except for fluttering draperies, they stand at the foot of Venus. One clutches a comb while holding up a mirror so that the goddess can view herself. The temple of Venus is shown in the background behind a grotto in which a stream of water cascades into an overflowing basin. Rubens does not depict any of the celebrants ritually bathing as described by Ovid, but the basin in the grotto alludes to that practice.\n", "\nArtist: Peter Paul Rubens\nArtwork Name: Ildefonso Altar\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/peter-paul-rubens/ildefonso-altar-1630\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Ildefonso Altarpiece is a triptych painting by Peter Paul Rubens, dating to between 1630 and 1631.

It was commissioned by Catherine Lescuyer as a commemorative piece for her father. Rubens created it as part of an altarpiece in the Church of St. Rombout (Rumbold) in Mechelen. The painting depicts Jesus and the Apostles during the Last Supper, with Judas dressed in blue turning back towards the viewer and away from the table. Other than Jesus, the most prominent figure is Judas. Judas holds his right hand to his mouth with his eyes avoiding direct contact with the other figures in the painting creating a nervous expression. Jesus is dressed in red and has a yellow halo surrounding his head with his face tilted upwards. Jesus is located centrally in the painting surrounded by his disciples with six on each side, and he holds a loaf of bread with a cup of wine in front of him. Out of all of the figures, he is the most in the light with the figures to the farthest left being the most in shadow. \u201cThe scene thus represents a perfect conflation of the theological significance of the Last Supper\u201d meaning the conflation between the blessing of the bread and the wine while still being pivotal in the sense of revealing the betrayal.\r As in many other Northern European depictions, a dog with a bone can be seen in the scene, probably a simple pet. It may represent faith, dogs are traditionally symbols of and are representing faith. According to J. Richard Judson the dog near Judas perhaps represents greed or evil, as the companion of Judas, as in John 13:27.\r This painting followed the first unsuccessful attempt by Rubens to produce a Last Supper in 1611, when his patrons backed out the last minute, perhaps due to the high price of 4,000 Guilder asked by Rubens.\r Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper fresco was a significant influence on Rubens who created an etching after the Davinci Last Supper, which was one of Rubens first attempts to express the full range of human emotion printed by Pieter Soutman. Rubens was also influenced by his humanist ideals from which he extracts biblical themes.\r Rubens often made engravings following the completion of his works. Other artists used these engravings to serve as a basis of their own works. These copies were even collected. The engravings and copies helped to lead to the popularity of Rubens\u2019 works during his lifetime.\r Alpers, Svetlana. \"Review by: Sveltana Alpers.\" Renaissance Quarterly 35, no. 1 (Spring 1982): 114.\r Freedberg, David. \"The Last Supper.\" In Peter Paul Rubens: Oil Paintings and Oil Sketches.

The work was first listed in 1666, when it was hung in the Royal Palace of Madrid, in the Spanish king's bedroom. In early inventories, the painting was called The Garden Party.\r It is the apotheosis of the outdoor courtly Merry Company genre painting. The subject of this piece is common in Baroque paintings, which used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, and grandeur. Rubens uses multi-layer allegory and symbolism to his paintings.\r In this 6.5\u00a0ft x 9.4\u00a0ft piece, a large group of well-dressed persons in the style of the 17th century lounge about, picnicking in an idyllic garden. Everyone is finely dressed, exercising their wealth and high class status. This demonstrates the depth of a full court scene in a recessional manner. Cupids interact with the individuals, bringing mythological figures into a realistic garden scene to produce a fantastical painting.\r All around the group, symbols of matrimonial love can be found including: the cupids, a pair of doves, flower crowns, music making, and Juno\u2019s peacock. The dogs represent loyalty and fealty. The garden represents Paradise, but also fertility. This painting is an allegory and exaltation of love and marriage, as well as the merry company.\r In the far-left corner, a male gentleman escorts a woman in all-black towards the entourage. The man is believed to be Rubens, which led to the early identification of this painting to be a self-portrait with friends. The Garden of Love is believed to be celebration of his marriage to Rubens\u2019 wife: H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Fourment.\r Helena Fourment was the second wife of Rubens. She was the subject of a few portraits by Rubens, and modeled for other religious and mythological paintings.\r The fountains of the Three Graces and the Venus represent marital happiness. The Three Graces fountains are three Rubenesque nude females\u2014soft bodied, voluptuous, and highly sexualized beings. These forms emphasize fertility and physical beauty, mirroring the beautiful garden scene. Directly below the Graces, an unsuspecting group of individuals getting sprayed by the fountain. The second fountain also depicts a nude female\u2014this time having the nude Venus sitting on the back of a fish and producing a stream of water from her breasts. This is known as the Nursing Venus and is meant to symbolize child bearing and rearing.\r This full-figured woman is identified by the peacock to be the goddess Juno, who is the goddess of marriage. Rubens plays on recognizable themes that his contemporary audience would recognize.\r Rubens uses motifs from Renaissance sculptures, but sets the scene in the mannerist portico of his own house in Antwerp .\r Rubens\u2019 merry company was influenced by Adriaen Brouwer, a Baroque Flemish artist, who painted intensely naturalistic merry company genre scenes. While only 60 works of his are known, Brouwer\u2019s work influenced the next generation of Flemish and Dutch genre painters. Brouwer painted atmospheric landscapes, painted with loose brushstrokes\u2014the influence of this style can be seen in Rubens' piece.\n", "\nArtist: Peter Paul Rubens\nArtwork Name: Helena Fourment with her Son Francis\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/peter-paul-rubens/helena-fourment-with-her-son-francis-1635\n\nWikipedia Article:\nHelena Fourment with her son Frans is a c.1635 painting by Peter Paul Rubens, showing his second wife Helena Fourment holding their second son Frans (born 12 July 1633).

It was painted for Ferdinando II de' Medici. Although commissioned by an Italian, art historians characterize both the work and the artist as Flemish Baroque. It serves as a commentary on a European continent ravaged by the Thirty Years' War, and the artist employed numerous symbols, both contemporary and ancient, to deplore the state of the continent.\r Mars: Mars is the central figure in the composition. The Roman god of war charges with shield and sword as well as breastplate and helmet. The figure\u2019s skin and cape are dominated by the color red to further emphasize his identity as the Roman god.\r Book and Drawing: Underneath Mars\u2019s feet lie a book and a drawing. These represent the manner in which the arts and letters are forgotten and destroyed in the chaos and violence of war.\r Temple of Janus: To the far left of the painting, the Temple of Janus appears with its door ajar. In Ancient Rome, the Temple of Janus would be closed to indicate times of peace while an open door denoted war. This phenomenon is referenced in Fasti by Ovid.\r Venus: The Roman goddess of love (and Mars\u2019s mistress) endeavors to restrain Mars and maintain peace. Her arm is looped ineffectually around his in a physical gesture. Her expression, meanwhile, plaintively entreaties Mars to stop his charge. Venus is depicted in typical Rubensian fashion with characteristic rolls of exposed flesh (See Arrival of Marie de\u2019 Medici or The Judgment of Paris for comparison.) The goddess is accompanied by Amors and Cupids who attempt to assist her.\r Fury Alekto: Alekto drags Mars on to his destructive purpose with a torch held high. Alekto was the Greek and Roman incarnation of anger. She appears in both Virgil\u2019s Aeneid and Dante\u2019s Inferno. Alekto translates from the Greek to \u201cthe implacable or unceasing anger.\u201d\r Pestilence and Famine: These effects of war are depicted as monsters accompanying Fury Alekto in order to heighten the terror of the scene. In addition, they deliberately refer to the apocalypse.\r Harmony: Rubens depicts Harmony as a woman holding a lute. However the chaos has pushed her to the ground and broken her lute. The damage to the lute represents the discord of war.\r Mother: Beside Harmony a mother clutches a child. This, Rubens writes, shows how \u201cWar corrupts and disrupts and destroys everything\u201d including \u201cprocreation and charity.\u201d\r Architect: An architect and his instruments have similarly fallen to the ground, showing how in times of war destruction and not creation is the norm.\r Arrows: Arrows lie on the ground near Venus and the Amors. When bound together they represent Concord but in their present state show its absence. Next to them lie the olive branch and caduceus, the symbols of peace. They too are depicted cast upon the ground to signify their absence in Europe.\r Woman in black: The figure to Venus\u2019s left represents Europe and its suffering. Her cross-topped globe represents the Christian world and is carried by the small angel to her immediate left.\n", "\nArtist: Peter Paul Rubens\nArtwork Name: Diana and Callisto\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/peter-paul-rubens/diana-and-callisto-1639\n\nWikipedia Article:\nDiana and Callisto is a painting produced by Peter Paul Rubens between 1637 and 1638.

It is on display at the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon (oil on canvas 202 x 241\u00a0cm).\r Jacob Jordaens (also known as Jacques Jordaens) was born in Anvers, United Provinces of the Netherlands, in 1593. He was brought up in a rich family and received a good education, proven by his biblical and mythological knowledge. In 1620, he painted Mercury and Argus and started collaborating with Van Dyck and Rubens.\r The Mayor of Lyon Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Termes acquired the artwork in 1843 for the sum of 2,000 francs (1,990 USD). It was restored in 1991 and was lent to the Petit Palais during the exhibition \"Jordaens (1593-1678), la gloire d'Anvers\" from September 19, 2013 to January 19, 2014.\r The painting refers to the myth of Mercury, Argus (Argos) and Io, found in The Metamorphoses written by Ovid (I, 583\u00a0; IX, 687)\u00a0:\r Jupiter (Zeus) falls in love with Io, who is the daughter of Inachos, as well as a priestess of Hera. But Jupiter's wife Hera investigates and finds out about their relationship. Jupiter has to transform Io into a beautiful, white heifer in order to save her from Hera's wrath and in the meantime transforms himself into a bull. Hera understands his strategy though and demands the heifer as a present. To end their affair, Hera puts Io under the guard of Argus Panoptes, her shepherd, who has 100 eyes. Jupiter commands his son Mercury (Hermes) to set Io free by lulling Argus to sleep with an enchanted flute. Mercury, disguised as a shepherd with a herd of stolen sheep, is invited by Argus to his camp. Mercury charms him with lullabies and then cuts his head off.\r \"Thus Argus lies in pieces, cold, and pale; And all his hundred eyes, with all their light, Are clos'd at once, in one perpetual night. These Juno takes, that they no more may fail, And spreads them in her peacock's gaudy tail.\"\r Io, cursed by Hera, has to escape and goes away to Egypt. Io will become the Egyptian goddess Isis.\r The framing is narrowed; the canvas is cut on the right-hand side and leaves no area to the scenery. The heifers are located on the superior part of the painting and it is difficult to distinguish them because their traits become confused. Their bodies form an upside down triangle and form, along with the bodies of the characters, a chiasmus (heifer, human, human, heifer) that appeals to the eye. The background is in fact a foreshadow of the murder; the colours of the sky and the bushes are dark, and three of the heifers are looking at the spectator.\r Mercury, disguised as a barefooted young shepherd with a straw hat, is gazing at Argus (who, unlike the myth, has only two eyes) and is about to strike a lethal blow. Argus is asleep, his hand on his stick. Argus' dog is also present, but seems sheepish and impassive.\r In fact, the dog is looking at the hidden knife under Mercury's leg. Mercury's movement with his knife, from the bottom to the top in a circular way, is highlighting the impression of movement and reinforces the suggested dramatic tension.\n", "\nArtist: Jacob Jordaens\nArtwork Name: The Four Evangelists\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacob-jordaens/the-four-evangelists\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Four Evangelists (French: Les quatre \u00e9vang\u00e9listes) is an oil on canvas painting by the Flemish Baroque artist Jacob Jordaens, completed in 1625.

Clara Peeters has painted her signature in the handle of the depicted knife. The painting is displayed in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague.\r Clara Peeters specialised in still lifes with beautiful objects, delicious fruits and expensive food. This type of still life is called \"banketje\" (banquet) in Dutch. The symbolism of these paintings is not fully known. It could be an encouragement to temperance, or a reference to The Last Supper. Or it might simply be a display of opulence and wealth.\r In this painting, in addition to the objects named in the title, there are also curls of butter, figs and a bread roll. In the background is a gold-plated Venetian glass. The almonds and figs are lying in a dish of Chinese Wanli porcelain. Peeters often used the objects in this painting in her still lifes.\r In the reflective cover of the \"bartmann\" jug behind the cheese Clara Peeters painted her own portrait. She thus followed the example of Jan van Eyck, who painted his self-portrait in 1434 in his famous double portrait of the Arnolfini Portrait couple. Clara Peeters made a total of seven self-portraits, including this one.\r The Mauritshuis museum in The Hague has the still life of Clara Peters, which it acquired in June 2012.

It depicts Charles dressed in civilian clothing and standing next to a horse as if resting on a hunt, in a manner described by the Louvre as a \"subtle compromise between gentlemanly nonchalance and regal assurance\".\r Van Dyck gave his naturalistic style full expression: \"Charles is given a totally natural look of instinctive sovereignty, in a deliberately informal setting where he strolls so negligently that that he seems at first glance nature's gentleman rather than England's King\". The 105 centimetres (41\u00a0in) by 76 centimetres (30\u00a0in) painting depicts Charles in lighter colours to the left of the painting, standing out against the darker ground and the shadowed servants and horse under a tree to the right; his dark hat prevents his face from appearing washed out by the sky. He stands dismounted, as if surveying his domain and the sea beyond (perhaps the Solent with the Isle of Wight visible in the distance), but with his head turned to give a slight disdainful smile towards the viewer. Charles was famously sensitive about his short stature, and the painting looks up towards the king from a low viewpoint. His kingship is proclaimed by a Latin inscription on a rock in the lower right corner, which reads \"Carolus.I.REX Magnae Britanniae\" (Charles I, King of Great Britain - a political statement at the time, only 32 years after his father James had united the crowns of Scotland and England, and proclaimed himself King of Great Britain, and nearly 70 years before the Acts of Union legally created the Kingdom of Great Britain).\r Charles is dressed as an aristocratic gentleman in a wide-brimmed Cavalier hat, teardrop earring, shimmering silver satin doublet, red breeches, and turned-down leather boots, apparently resting during a day of hunting. He is girt with a sword, with one hand resting nonchalantly on a walking stick; the other rests on his hip, holding his gloves as a sign of his sovereignty and assurance. The painting also shows a young page and Charles' picture-buying agent and favoured courtier, Endymion Porter, who is holding the horse. The horse seemingly bows its head in submission to the king.\r In his three years as Principal Painter in Ordinary, Van Dyck had already made two other equestrian portraits of Charles in armour: Charles I with M. de St Antoine depicting Charles accompanied by his riding master, Pierre Antoine Bourdon, Seigneur de St Antoine; and Equestrian Portrait of Charles I depicting Charles as a heroic philosopher king, contemplatively surveying his domain.\r Charles paid van Dyck \u00a3100 for the painting in 1638 - although the artist originally requested \u00a3200 - but it is not mentioned in the inventory of his collections after his execution. It was in France by 1738, and the Comtesse du Barry sold the painting to Louis XVI of France in 1775. It is now held at the Louvre Museum in Paris.\n", "\nArtist: Anthony van Dyck\nArtwork Name: Sir Endymion Porter and the Artist\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck/sir-endymion-porter-and-the-artist\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSelf-portrait with Sir Endymion Porter is a self-portrait by Anthony van Dyck, showing him with his patron Sir Endymion Porter.\r The painting was produced in 1635 and measures 119\u00a0cm by 127\u00a0cm.

The pair had first met in 1620, during van Dyck's first stay in London. Porter was Charles I of England's main art dealer, negotiating to acquire the vast art collection of the Duke of Mantua and also collecting art for himself. He also knew Peter Paul Rubens and Orazio Gentileschi.

Painted in 1635 or 1636, it is currently part of the Royal Collection. The colours of the costumes and pattern of the lace collars are different in each portrait, though the blue riband of the Order of the Garter is present in all three.\r The painting was sent to Rome in 1636 to be used as a reference work for the Italian sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini to create a marble bust of Charles I. Pope Urban VIII sent the bust to Charles's queen Henrietta Maria in 1638 in the hope of encouraging a reconciliation of the Roman Catholic Church with the Church of England. The bust was presented in 1637 and admired for its workmanship and likeness to the King. Charles rewarded Bernini with a valuable diamond ring. Queen Henrietta Maria commissioned Bernini to make a companion bust of her, but the English Civil War intervened and it was never made. The bust of Charles was sold at the end of the English Civil War but recovered for the Royal Collection on the Restoration, only to be destroyed by a fire in Whitehall Palace in January 1698.\r The painting remained in the possession of Bernini and his heirs in the Bernini Palace on the Via del Corso until c. 1802, when it was sold to British art dealer William Buchanan and returned to England. It was exhibited at the British Gallery in 1821 and acquired for the Royal Collection in 1822, and is usually displayed at Windsor Castle.\r It is thought that the painting was influenced by Lorenzo Lotto's Triple Portrait of a Goldsmith, c. 1530, then in the Royal Collection. In its turn, Van Dyck's portrait of Charles I may have influenced Philippe de Champaigne's Triple portrait of Cardinal de Richelieu, c. 1642.\r Many copies of the work were made, possibly by supporters of the royal House of Stuart, including one created around 1750 and now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\r The British Museum has an engraving which was believed to depict the bust before it was destroyed, with baroque locks of flowing hair, fine lace collar, garter sash, possibly by Robert van Voerst, but now believed to show a bust by Fran\u00e7ois Dieussart.\n", "\nArtist: Anthony van Dyck\nArtwork Name: Cupid and Psyche\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck/cupid-and-psyche-1640\n\nWikipedia Article:\nCupid and Psyche is a 1638\u201340 painting by Anthony van Dyck.

That project never came to completion, which is one possible explanation for why the painting has no frame and is relatively unfinished. This would date it to 1638\u20131640. A second alternative is that it was produced for the celebrations of Princess Mary's marriage to William II of Orange in 1641.\n", "\nArtist: David Teniers the Younger\nArtwork Name: The Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his Picture Gallery in Brussels\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/david-teniers-the-younger/the-archduke-leopold-wilhelm-in-his-picture-gallery-in-brussels-1651\n\nWikipedia Article:\nArchduke Leopold Wilhelm and the artist in the archducal picture gallery in Brussels is a 1651 painting of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm's Italian art collection by the Flemish Baroque painter David Teniers the Younger, now held in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.\r The painting shows the Archduke as a collector with friends admiring a set of paintings. The artist himself holds his hat in his hand and is listening to his patron as the archduke gestures with his cane towards some recent acquisitions. The paintings are arranged in rows on a rear wall, with several others on the side of the vestibule on the left, and a set that are positioned in the foreground leaning against chairs for inspection.\r This painting is a copy by the artist and one of the first that David Teniers the Younger prepared to document the Archduke's collection before he employed 12 engravers to publish his Theatrum Pictorium, considered the \"first illustrated art catalog\". He published this book of engravings after the Archduke had moved to Austria and taken his collection with him. It was published in Antwerp in 1659 and again in 1673. The original version of this painting, with the figures arranged differently, is in the collection of Petworth House, south of London.\r Most of the recognizable paintings in the collection, not all of which were included in the Italian catalog prepared by Teniers, are still in the Viennese collection. The full list of the depicted paintings is the same as the Petworth version. That version, which includes a portrait of Bishop Antonius Triest (1576-1657), served as the basis for this copy, though they are about the same size and were possibly both made at the same time in tandem. The bishop was an art collector and a patron of many of Teniers's contemporary artists in Antwerp, and introduced Teniers to the Archduke. This copy remained in the archducal collection, while several others were documented as gifts.

His military exploits over his five-decade career earned him a reputation as one of the greatest generals in modern history.\r Born to a Huguenot family, Turenne learned his military skills in Dutch service during the Eighty Years' War. After returning to France in 1630, he rose to prominence during the Thirty Years' War by capturing the fortress of Breisach in 1638. Created Marshal of France in 1643, he invaded Bavaria the following year, defeating the Bavarian army in three years of campaigning and forcing the Elector of Bavaria to make peace. The Elector soon broke the treaty and in 1648 Turenne invaded again with Swedish support, subduing the Imperial army at Zusmarshausen and pacifying Bavaria.\r Turenne initially supported the Fronde but returned to Royal service in 1651, emerging as France's foremost general by defeating the rebellious army of the Prince of Cond\u00e9 on the outskirts of Paris and re-occupying the city. Turenne's triumphs against Spanish armies at Arras (1654) and at Dunkirk (1658) led to the overrunning of much of the Spanish Netherlands and brought the war against Spain to a victorious conclusion. Two years later, Louis XIV appointed him Marshal General of France. A supporter of absolute monarchy, he converted to Catholicism in 1668.\r During the War of Devolution in 1667 Turenne captured the Spanish Netherlands practically without resistance. In 1672 the French invaded the Dutch Republic and the Marshal General conquered the country up to Amsterdam. Checked by the Dutch flooding of the land, he invaded the Holy Roman Empire the next year, reaching the Elbe and compelling Brandenburg to abandon the anti-French coalition. Faced with the loss of Alsace to superior Allied forces, Turenne crowned his career with a series of battlefield victories, most notably at Turckheim (1675) and a masterful strategic turning movement around the Vosges in mid-winter that drove the Imperials from Alsace. He was killed by an Imperial cannonball at the battle of Salzbach in 1675.\r The second son of Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, vicomte de Turenne, duc de Bouillon, sovereign Prince of Sedan, by his second wife Elizabeth, daughter of William the Silent, Prince of Orange, he was born at Sedan. He received a Huguenot education and the usual training of a young noble of the time, but physical infirmity, and particularly an impediment of speech (which he never lost), hampered his progress, though he showed a marked partiality for history and geography, and especial admiration of the exploits of Alexander the Great and Caesar. After his father's death in 1623, he devoted himself to bodily exercises and in a great measure overcame his natural weakness. At the age of fourteen he went to learn war in the camp of his uncle, Maurice of Nassau the Stadtholder of Holland and Prince of Orange, and began his military career (as a private soldier in that prince's bodyguard) in the Eighty Years' War.\n", "\nArtist: Jean Fouquet\nArtwork Name: Madonna and Child.

The name of the diptych came from its original home in the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame in Melun. The left panel depicts Etienne Chevalier with his patron saint St. Stephen and the right panel depicts the Virgin and Christ child surrounded by cherubim. Each wooden panel measures about 93 by 85 centimeters and the two would have been hinged together at the center. The two pieces, originally a diptych, are now separated. The left panel now resides in the Staatliche Museen in Berlin and the right panel is now located at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp, Belgium. A self-portrait medallion is also associated with the two panels. Measuring 6 centimeters in diameter, it would have adorned the frame, and consists of copper, enamel, and gold. The medallion is now located in the Louvre in Paris, France.\r On the left \u00c9tienne Chevalier, the treasurer to King Charles VII of France, kneels in a red robe with in his hand in a position of prayer. The king liked to have non-aristocrats such as Chevalier about him because he thought them more reliable than nobles. On his right is Chevalier's patron saint, St. Stephen, in a dark deacon's robes with gold trim. His right arm is draped across Chevalier's shoulder while his left hand holds a book and a jagged rock, his representational attribute as he was stoned to death. Both men gaze off to the right as if they were looking at the Virgin and child on the other panel. The wall behind the treasurer and his patron saint is inlaid with marble panels and has elaborate white and gold moldings. The tiled floor's neutral colors create a stark contrast with the saturated colors of the men's robes. Identifying Chevalier is an engraving on the wall behind him that says \"IER ESTIEN\". This lettering has been used to link the painting to Fouquet since he never signed any of his work. It is very similar to lettering used in several miniatures which are attributed to him.\r Seated on an elaborate gold throne, the Madonna and the Christ child are depicted in the right panel. The Madonna wears a blue dress, white mantle and a jewel-encrusted crown. On her lap sits the child, who makes a pointing gesture to the left with His left hand at the patron and the saint. The two are surrounded by blue and red cherubim, which greatly contrast with the pale skin of the Virgin and child. Although the figures are modeled realistically, the mood is otherworldly, described by historian Roger Fry as a dreamlike state of sentimentalism. The Madonna is depicted here as the Queen of Heaven and is meant to reveal her as between the veil of heaven and earth. She is both human and otherworldly. The unnatural colors have been attributed to represent the heraldic colors of the king, being red, white, and blue. The Virgin is believed to be an idealized portrait of Agn\u00e8s Sorel, mistress of King Charles VII, who died two years earlier. Sorel was considered by many at the time to be \"the most beautiful woman in the world\" and therefore an obvious choice after which to model the Virgin. As minister of finance to the king, Etienne Chevalier was the executor of her will. Her costume and physical attributes have been compared to other representations of Sorel, such as another painting by Fouquet in which her dress is very similar to that in the diptych. It has also been suggested that the woman could be Chevalier's wife, Catherine Bude, over whose tomb the diptych was hung in Notre Dame, Melun.\n", "\nArtist: Georges de la Tour\nArtwork Name: St. Joseph, the Carpenter\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-de-la-tour/st-joseph-the-carpenter-1640\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJoseph the Carpenter is an oil painting by Georges de La Tour created circa 1645.

John Rupert Martin writes that Jesus' patience represents \"filial obedience and the acceptance of his destiny as martyr\".\r This painting, created around the year 1645 is one of several tenebrist paintings by La Tour. Others include The Education of the Virgin, the Penitent Magdalene, and The Dream of St. Joseph. In all these works, a single, strong light source is a central element, surrounded by cast shadows.

It is also known as the Satyr and the Sleeping Nymph and was probably painted between 1714 and 1719. Intended to be placed over a doorway, today it hangs in the Louvre in Paris.\r The painting is oval shaped, with a width of 107.5\u00a0cm and a height of 73\u00a0cm. In the foreground it depicts the naked, sleeping Antiope. She lies with her head on the left edge of the painting, twisted so that her front side faces the viewer. Her right arm is bent under her head while her left arm hangs down into the abyss in front of her. This arm covers the right breast, while the left remains free. Her legs are bent up towards the viewer, with the right continuing the line of her body at the knee while her left leg is only slightly bent to point back to the lower right of the painting. The whole body is painted in pale, warm colours and lights up the otherwise dark and earthy image. Under the sleeping woman there is a cloth, which hangs over the abyss near her breast, disappears under her arm near her head and is lifted by the satyr behind her.\r The satyr, whose head is crowned with grape vines symbolising the presence of the god Bacchus. lies in the opposite direction behind the woman, with the front of his body also facing the viewer. With his left arm he lifts the cloth to the height of Antiope's shoulder and it is obvious that he has just uncovered the sleeping maiden. His left arm is bent on a tree root at the right edge of the image and props up his upper body. With his head and upper body, the satyr looms over the hips of the sleeper in order to gaze upon her - he licks his lips lustfully. His body is shadowy and cannot be made out below his hips. The satyr is depicted in brown tones. His suntanned skin and muscular body forms a clear contrast with the softly worked, shapely Antiope.\r The lower edge of the image is taken up by an abyss, which is depicted in dark brown tones and is edged with bare soil. On either side, gnarled roots grow in the soil, which rise into indistinct trees. The ground continues above the trees into the background, where there is a hill with lone houses. Above that is the cloudy sky, discreetly lit by the glow of twilight.\r The composition fits the oval shape of the image. The sleeping Antiope forms the central horizontal, with her hips and bent legs creating the central vertical. The arms of the satyr and the legs of the woman curve in parallel with the upper edge of the painting - in this way the two central characters repeat the oval within the image, which is broken only by dangling left arm of the woman. Spatial depth is created by the stooped posture of Jupiter and by the bent knees of Antiope.\n", "\nArtist: Antoine Watteau\nArtwork Name: The Embarkation for Cythera\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/antoine-watteau/the-embarkation-for-cythera-1717\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Embarkation for Cythera (\"L'Embarquement pour Cyth\u00e8re\") is a painting by the French painter Jean-Antoine Watteau. It is also known as Voyage to Cythera and Pilgrimage to the Isle of Cythera. Watteau submitted this work to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture as his reception piece in 1717. The painting is now in the Louvre in Paris. A second version of the work, sometimes called Pilgrimage to Cythera to distinguish it, was painted by Watteau about 1718 or 1719 and is in the Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin.\r The painting portrays a \"f\u00eate galante\"; an amorous celebration or party enjoyed by the aristocracy of France during the R\u00e9gence after the death of Louis XIV, which is generally seen as a period of dissipation and pleasure, and peace, after the sombre last years of the previous reign.\r The work celebrates love, with many cupids flying around the couples and pushing them closer together, as well as the statue of Venus (the goddess of sexual love). There are three pairs of lovers in the foreground. While the couple on the right by the statue are still engaged in their passionate tryst, another couple rises to follow a third pair down the hill, although the woman of the third pair glances back fondly at the goddess\u2019s sacred grove. At the foot of the hill, several more happy couples are preparing to board the golden boat at the left. With its light and wispy brushstrokes, the hazy landscape in the background does not give to any clues about the season, or whether it is dawn or dusk.\r It has often been noted that, despite the title, the people on the island seem to be leaving rather than arriving, especially since they have already paired up. Many art historians have come up with a variety of interpretations of the allegory of the voyage to the island of love. Watteau himself purposely did not give an answer.\r In the ancient world, Cythera, one of the Greek islands, was thought to be the birthplace of Venus, goddess of love. Thus, the island became sacred to the goddess and love. However, the subject of Cythera may have been inspired by certain 17th century operas or an illustration of a minor play. In Florent Carton Dancourt's Les Trois Cousines, a girl dressed as a pilgrim steps out from the chorus line and invites the audience to join her on a voyage to the island, where everyone will meet their ideal partner.\r It was around 1709 that Watteau painted his first, more literal version of the theme, which nonetheless bears a compositional similarity to the Louvre painting. This work is now in the St\u00e4dtische Galerie im St\u00e4delschen Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt-am-Main.\r When Watteau was accepted as a member of the Academy in 1714, he was expected to present the customary reception piece. Although he was given unusual freedom in choosing a subject for his painting, his failure to submit a work brought several reprimands. Meanwhile, Watteau worked on numerous private commissions that his rising reputation brought him. Finally, in January, 1717, the Academy called Watteau to task, and in August of that year he presented his painting, which had been painted quickly in the preceding eight months. Once submitted, the painting caused the Academy to invent a new classification for it, since the subject was so striking and new. This resulted in the f\u00eate galantes (elegant f\u00eates or outdoor entertainments), a genre subsequently practiced by imitators of Watteau, such as Jean-Baptiste Pater and Nicolas Lancret. While the creation of the new category acknowledged Watteau as the originator of the genre, it also prevented him being recognised as history painter, the highest class of painter, and the only one from which the academy's professors were drawn. Charles-Antoine Coypel, the son of its then director, later said: \"The charming paintings of this gracious painter would be a bad guide for whoever wished to paint the Acts of the Apostles.\"\n", "\nArtist: Antoine Watteau\nArtwork Name: L'Enseigne de Gersaint\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/antoine-watteau/l-enseigne-de-gersaint-1720\n\nWikipedia Article:\nL'Enseigne de Gersaint, or \"The Shop Sign of Gersaint\", (1720\u201321) is a painting by Jean-Antoine Watteau, which is considered to be his last masterpiece. It was painted as a shop sign for the marchand-mercier, or art dealer, Edme Fran\u00e7ois Gersaint. According to Daniel Roche the sign functioned more as an advertisement for the artist than the dealer.\r The painting exaggerates the size of Gersaint's cramped boutique, hardly more than a permanent booth with a little backshop, on the medieval Pont Notre-Dame, in the heart of Paris, both creating and following fashion as he purveyed works of art and luxurious trifles to an aristocratic clientele.\r The picture was originally painted on one canvas, depicting clients and staff at the shop. As a worker packs away a portrait of Louis XIV at the left, in the centre a young man offers his hand to a woman who is stepping over the threshold of the shop. At the right an elderly couple examine a painting of nudes, and a pretty young shop assistant, possibly Gersaint's wife, shows a painting to a group of well-dressed young people. In its present form, the painting consists of two separate parts, the upper sections of them were added between 1720 and 1732 by an unknown painter to transform the painting from its original, arched shape into a rectangular field. Watteau probably painted the work in the spring of 1720 when the entire entrance facade of Gersaint's shop was rebuilt. According to the study by Vogtherr and Wenders de Calisse (2007) the painting had originally covered the round field above the entrance of the shop. These changes to the building were made in the spring of 1720, the most likely date for the painting.\r The artworks in the painting are set alongside the actions of high-society criticism. The young man offering his hand to the woman in pink is set against a series of female nudes, while puritanical figures in portraits at the left seem to look down disapprovingly. At the right, there are numerous images of orgies and naked figures, implying that art expresses the hidden lustful feelings of the genteel figures in the shop, who merely gaze at one another or engage in polite gestures of intimacy.\r Commonly, the painting is interpreted as a commentary on the shift in aristocratic culture \u2013 or relief \u2013 that occurred during the government of the more licentious R\u00e9gent Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans (1715\u20131723), after the death of Louis XIV and before the accession to the throne of Louis XV. The boxing of Pierre Mignard's portrait of the deceased king implies the end of the old r\u00e9gime.\r The painting never actually functioned as an external shop sign, spending only fifteen days at the shop. Watteau himself asked Gersaint to allow him to paint it, complaining of \"cold fingers\" that needed some exercise. It was soon bought by Claude Glucq. It was then acquired by Watteau's patron Jean de Jullienne. An engraving was made in 1732 after a small version by Pater who extended Watteau's composition for the print. It attracted the attention of Frederick the Great of Prussia. He bought the painting in 1748 (at that time already in two separate parts) from the Dutch dealer Pieter Boetgens. It remained in Germany thereafter, now forming part of the collection of the Stiftung Preu\u00dfische Schl\u00f6sser und G\u00e4rten Berlin-Brandenburg that display it at the Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin where it had first been displayed in 1748.\n", "\nArtist: Francois Boucher\nArtwork Name: Fishing\nArtwork Genre: pastorale\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francois-boucher/fishing-1752\n\nWikipedia Article:\nFishing (French: La p\u00eache \u00e0 la ligne) is a painting by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, from 1757.\r The painting is an oil on canvas with dimensions of 150x188 centimeters.

He was Secretary of the State of Internal Affairs of the Kingdom (the equivalent of a Prime Minister today) in the government of Joseph I of Portugal from 1750 to 1777. Undoubtedly the most prominent minister in the government, he is considered to have been its de facto head. Pombal is notable for his swift and competent leadership in the aftermath of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. He implemented sweeping economic policies in Portugal to regulate commercial activity and standardise quality throughout the country, and was instrumental in weakening the grip of the Inquisition. The term Pombaline is used to describe not only his tenure, but also the architectural style adopted in Lisbon after the great earthquake.\r Pombal, who was considered an estrangeirado, introduced many fundamental administrative, educational, economic, and ecclesiastical reforms justified in the name of \"reason\" and instrumental in advancing secularisation in Portugal. However, historians argue that Pombal's implementation of the ideas of the \"Enlightenment\", while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying print censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.\r Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo (Portuguese pronunciation:\u00a0[s\u0268b\u0250\u0283ti\u02c8\u0250\u0303w\u0303 \u0292u\u02c8z\u025b d\u0268 k\u0250\u027e\u02c8va\u028eu i \u02c8m\u025blu]) was born in Lisbon, the son of Manuel de Carvalho e Ata\u00edde, a country squire with properties in the Leiria region, and of his wife Teresa Lu\u00edsa de Mendon\u00e7a e Melo. During his youth he studied at the University of Coimbra and then served briefly in the army. He then moved to Lisbon and eloped with Teresa de Mendon\u00e7a e Almada (1689\u20131737), the niece of the Count of Arcos. The marriage was a turbulent one, as she had married him against her family's wishes. Her parents made life unbearable for the young couple; they eventually moved to Melo properties near Pombal.\r In 1738, Pombal received his first public appointment as the Portuguese ambassador to Great Britain. In 1745, he served as the Portuguese ambassador to Austria. The Queen consort of Portugal, Archduchess Mary Anne Josepha of Austria (1683\u20131754), was fond of him; after his first wife died she arranged for him to marry the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal Leopold Josef, Count von Daun. The King, John V, was not pleased, however, and recalled him in 1749. John V died the following year and his son Joseph I of Portugal was crowned king. Joseph I was fond of Pombal; with the Queen Mother's approval he appointed him as Minister of Foreign Affairs. As the King's confidence in him increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the state. In 1740 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society\r By 1755, the King appointed him Prime Minister. Impressed by English economic success which he had witnessed as ambassador, Pombal successfully implemented similar economic policies in Portugal. He abolished slavery in Portugal and the Portuguese colonies in India, reorganised the army and the navy, abolished the Autos-de-f\u00e9 and ended the Limpeza de Sangue (cleanliness of blood) civil statutes and their discrimination against New Christians, the Jews that had converted to Christianity, and their descendants regardless of genealogical distance, to escape the Portuguese Inquisition.\n", "\nArtist: Pierre-Narcisse Guerin\nArtwork Name: Portrait of a Young Girl\nArtwork Genre: nude painting (nu),portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-narcisse-guerin/portrait-of-a-young-girl-1812\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJeune fille en buste (Portrait of the young girl) is a work by Pierre-Narcisse Gu\u00e9rin painted in 1794 and exhibited at the Louvre.

She has two flower bouquets in her hands: one laid down on her knees, composed of buttercups, daisies and cornflowers, the other one held vertically is composed of poppies. In the background, the landscape shows a verdant plains and the mountains of the Bugey region. The sky is blue, with some white clouds near the mountains, and indicates that the scene probably takes place in the late afternoon. Each flower, as well as the woman's face, are painted with an extremely accuracy, the colors used are sweet and some melancholy emanates from the scene.

It was restored in 1974.\r Larousse Encyclopedia describes this work as \"well-balanced\". However, it is unclear if the painting is the portrait of a woman known by Janmot, but the clothes she wears do not comply with her time, but recall the portraits of the Italian Renaissance. This may be a painting of flowers, as this type of art was very popular in Lyon in the 19th century.

The painting records the funeral in September 1848 of his great-uncle in the painter's birthplace, the small town of Ornans. It treats an ordinary provincial funeral with unflattering realism, and on the giant scale traditionally reserved for the heroic or religious scenes of history painting. Its exhibition at the 1850\u201351 Paris Salon created an \"explosive reaction\" and brought Courbet instant fame. It is currently displayed at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris, France.\r The Salon found Courbet triumphant with The Stone Breakers, the Peasants of Flagey, and A Burial at Ornans. People who had attended the funeral were used as models for the painting. Previously, models had been used as actors in historical narratives; here Courbet said that he \"painted the very people who had been present at the interment, all the townspeople\". The result is a realistic presentation of them, and of life, in Ornans.\r The painting, which drew both praise and fierce denunciations from critics and the public, is an enormous work, measuring 10 by 22 feet (3.1 by 6.6 metres), depicting a prosaic ritual on a scale which previously would have been reserved for a work of history painting. According to art historian Sarah Faunce, \"In Paris the Burial was judged as a work that had thrust itself into the grand tradition of history painting, like an upstart in dirty boots crashing a genteel party, and in terms of that tradition it was of course found wanting.\" Then too, the painting lacks the sentimental rhetoric that was expected in a genre work: Courbet's mourners make no theatrical gestures of grief, and their faces seem more caricatured than ennobled. The critics accused Courbet of a deliberate pursuit of ugliness. Eventually the public grew more interested in the new Realist approach, and the lavish, decadent fantasy of Romanticism lost popularity. The artist well understood the importance of this painting; Courbet said: \"The Burial at Ornans was in reality the burial of Romanticism.\" It might also be said to be the burial of the hierarchy of genres which had dominated French art since the 17th century.\r In 1873, when Courbet's political views had changed, he repudiated the work saying that it was \"worth nothing\".\n", "\nArtist: Gustave Courbet\nArtwork Name: The Wheat Sifters\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet/the-wheat-sifters-1855-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Wheat Sifters (Les Cribleuses de Bl\u00e9) is an 1854 painting by Gustave Courbet.\r It was exhibited at the Salon of 1855 in Paris, then in 1861 at the ninth exhibition of the Society of Friends of the Art of Nantes, which then bought the painting for the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Nantes.\r Both young women are probably the two sisters of Courbet: Zoe (in the center) and Juliet (seated).

It is located in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris, France.\r Courbet painted The Painter's Studio in Ornans, France in 1855. \"The world comes to be painted at my studio,\" said Courbet of the Realist work. The figures in the painting are allegorical representations of various influences on Courbet's artistic life. On the left are human figures from all levels of society. In the center, Courbet works on a landscape, while turned away from a nude model who is a symbol of Academic art. On the right are friends and associates of Courbet, mainly elite Parisian society figures, including Charles Baudelaire, Champfleury, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and Courbet's most prominent patron, Alfred Bruyas.\r The 1855 Paris World Fair's jury accepted eleven of Courbet's works for the Exposition Universelle, but The Painter's Studio was not among them. In an act of self promotion and defiance, Courbet, with the help of Alfred Bruyas, opened his own exhibition (The Pavilion of Realism) close to the official exposition; this was a forerunner of the various Salon des Refus\u00e9s. Very little praise was forthcoming, and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix was one of the few painters who supported the work. Of the painting, Courbet stated that The Painter's Studio \"represents society at its best, its worst, and its average.\"\r The painting was produced during Courbet's involvement with Realism in art in the mid-1800s. Due to the short amount of time Courbet had to paint it, many original plans for the work had to be discarded. The most noticeable example of this is in the background of the painting. On the back wall of the studio in the painting, Courbet planned to paint replications of other works of his. He ran out of time to paint these in their entirety, so he then covered them up with a reddish-brown preparation color, leaving the partially-finished paintings still relatively visible.\r The left side of the painting depicts people of everyday life in France. The Jewish man and the Irishwoman were seen on a trip Courbet took to London in 1848, according to a letter Courbet wrote to Champfleury detailing what the painting would look like. There is also a \"lay figure\"/\"crucified figure\" directly to the left of Courbet's easel. This figure appears contorted and potentially mangled. Art historians Benedict Nicolson and Georges Riat both interpret this figure as a symbol of the \"death\" of the art of the Royal Academy of Art in France.\r The center of the painting depicts Courbet painting a landscape, a nude female figure, a young boy, and a white cat. On his canvas, Courbet paints the Loue River valley. This valley in the Franche-Comt\u00e9 region of France is a tribute to Courbet's homeland of Ornans, France. The female figure is based on an 1854 photograph by J.\u00a0V. de Villeneuve and has been interpreted as a representation of the art of the Academy or as Courbet's Muse for Realism.\n", "\nArtist: Gustave Courbet\nArtwork Name: The Origin of the World\nArtwork Genre: nude painting (nu)\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet/the-origin-of-the-world-1866\n\nWikipedia Article:\nL'Origine du monde (\"The Origin of the World\") is a picture painted in oil on canvas by the French artist Gustave Courbet in 1866. It is a close-up view of the genitals and abdomen of a naked woman, lying on a bed with legs spread. The framing of the nude body, with head, arms and lower legs outside of view, emphasizes the eroticism of the work.\r At the time Courbet was working on the painting his favourite model was a young woman, Joanna Hiffernan, also known as Jo. Her lover at the time was the American painter James Whistler, a friend of Courbet.\r Courbet did another painting in 1866, La belle Irlandaise (Portrait of Jo), whose model was Hiffernan. During his whole career, Courbet did four portraits of Hiffernan. She was probably the model for L'Origine du monde, which might explain Courbet's and Whistler's brutal separation a short while later. Whistler then returned to London. In spite of Hiffernan's red hair contrasting with the darker pubic hair of L'Origine du monde, the hypothesis that Hiffernan was the model for it continues. In her RED: A Natural History of the Redhead Jacky Colliss Harvey puts forward the idea that the woman's body-hair suggests a more obvious candidate might be the brunette painted with Hiffernan in Courbet's Le Sommeil; and that the identification with Hiffernan has been greatly influenced by the eroticised and sexualised image of the female redhead.\r In February 2013, Paris Match reported that Courbet expert Jean-Jacques Fernier had authenticated a painting of a young woman's head and shoulders as the upper section of L'Origine du monde which according to some was severed from the original work. Fernier has stated that because of the conclusions reached after two years of analysis, the head will be added to the next edition of the Courbet catalogue raisonn\u00e9. The Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay has indicated that L'Origine du monde was not part of a larger work.\r The Daily Telegraph reported that \"experts at the [French] art research centre CARAA (Centre d'Analyses et de Recherche en Art et Arch\u00e9ologie) were able to align the two paintings via grooves made by the original wooden frame and lines in the canvas itself, whose grain matched.\" According to CARAA, it performed pigment analyses which were identified as classical pigments of the 2nd half of the 19th century. No other conclusions were reported by the CARAA. The claim reported by Paris Match was characterized as dubious by Le Monde art critic Philippe Dagen, indicating differences in style, and that canvas-similarities could be caused by buying from the same shop.\r The commission for L'Origine du monde is believed to have come from Khalil Bey, an Ottoman diplomat, former ambassador of the Ottoman Empire in Athens and Saint Petersburg who had just moved to Paris. Sainte-Beuve introduced him to Courbet and he ordered a painting to add to his personal collection of erotic pictures, which already included Le Bain turc (The Turkish Bath) from Ingres and another painting by Courbet, Le Sommeil (The Sleepers), for which it is supposed that Hiffernan was one of the models.\n", "\nArtist: Gustave Courbet\nArtwork Name: The Sleepers\nArtwork Genre: nude painting (nu)\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet/the-sleepers-1866\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLe Sommeil (translated in English variously as The Sleepers and Sleep) is an erotic oil painting on canvas by French artist Gustave Courbet created in 1866. The painting, which depicts lesbianism, is also known as the Two Friends (Les Deux Amies) and Indolence and Lust (Paresse et Luxure).\r Le Sommeil was originally commissioned by the Turkish diplomat and art collector of the late Ottoman era, Halil \u015eerif Pa\u015fa, who had lived in Paris since 1860. The painting was not permitted to be shown publicly until 1988, like a number of his other works such as L'Origine du monde. When Le Sommeil was exhibited by a picture dealer in 1872, it became the subject of a police report. One of the models for the painting was Joanna Hiffernan, who was the mistress of fellow painter James Abbott Whistler at the time. Whistler's relationship with Hiffernan ended soon afterwards, and his opinion of Courbet soured.\r The Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures describes Le Sommeil as a \"famous\" painting. The painting created an impact in 19th-century art, because after the public display of Le Sommeil, a number of contemporary artists were influenced by the theme of lesbian couples. Repetition of this theme helped to lower the taboos associated with lesbian relationships.\r Today Le Sommeil is in the collection of the Petit Palais, a Paris museum.\r The painting shows two naked women lying asleep on a bed entwined in an erotic embrace, resting after sexual intercourse.\r The setting is a bedroom with various textiles and ornamental furnishing. In the background there is a dark blue velvet curtain and in the right corner a table with a decorative flower vase. In the foreground is a small wooden table holding three items \u2013 a colored flacon (a small vessel), a transparent crystal vase, and a cup. Except for these few furnishings, there is nothing in the painting to overshadow the main image \u2013 the women.\r One of the sleeping women is redhead, the other is brunette. For color contrast, Courbet worked curves between the women. A broken pearl necklace and a hairpin scattered in the bed reference the nature of their previous activity.\r The painting was inspired by Charles Baudelaire's poem \"Delphine et Hippolyte\", from his collection Les Fleurs du mal.Le Sommeil has been interpreted as a realist painting, detailing the bodies without glossing over their imperfections.\n", "\nArtist: Gustave Courbet\nArtwork Name: Woman with a Parrot\nArtwork Genre: nude painting (nu)\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet/woman-with-a-parrot-1866\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLa Femme au perroquet (Woman with a Parrot) is an oil painting on canvas by French artist Gustave Courbet.

Two characters are on the right. The drill is Cusenier Jules, a resident of Ornans while the man on horseback is Felix Gaudy, of Vuillafans. L'Hallali is in the tradition of representation of the scene hunt, from the seventeenth century. Courbet uses a harsh realistic representation closer to Flemish models.

It depicts two teams of oxen ploughing the land, and expresses deep commitment to the land; it may have been inspired by the opening scene of George Sand's 1846 novel La Mare au Diable. Commissioned by the government and winner of a First Medal at the Salon in 1849, today it is held in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris.\r The Nivernais, the area around Nevers, was known for its Charolais cattle, which was to play an important role in the agricultural revolution that took place in the area in the nineteenth century. Rosa Bonheur gained a reputation painting animals, and Ploughing in the Nivernais features twelve Charolais oxen, in two groups of six. On a sunny autumn day they plough the land; this is the sombrage, the first stage of soil preparation in the fall, which opens up the soil to aeration during the winter. Humans play a minor role in the painting\u2014the farmer is almost completely hidden behind his animals. The freshly-ploughed land is prominent in the foreground, while the landscape behind is basking in sunlight. The painting's clarity and light resembles that of the Dutch paintings (esp. by Paulus Potter) which Bonheur had studied as part of her education.\r According to Albert Boime, the painting should be seen as a glorification of peasant life and its ancient traditions; he places it in the context of the revolutionary year 1848, when cities were the scene of chaos and strife.\r Rosa Bonheur made the painting by commission of the French government for 3000 francs; it was shown in the Salon in 1849, where it won her a First Medal. N. D'Anvers repeats an apparently well-known story, that it was inspired by the opening scene of George Sand's novel La Mare au Diable (1846), which features oxen ploughing a landscape with the author's commentary, \"a noble subject for a painter\". The comparison with Sand is amplified in an article in the July 1899 edition of The Literary Digest, which referred to the painting as a \"pictorial translation of the novel\". Initially intended for the museum in Lyon, it was instead exhibited in the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg in Paris and was a featured exhibit at the 1889 World Fair. The painting was moved to the Louvre and afterward to the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. She made a number of copies, one of which is in the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art.\r Rosa Bonheur was claimed by New York Times critic Mary Blume as \"the most famous woman painter of her time, perhaps of all time\". Besides The Horse Fair, Ploughing in the Nivernais is one of Bonheur's best-known paintings, and somewhat resembles Oxen going to work by Constant Troyon. An early admirer was Anna Elizabeth Klumpke, who copied the work in the Luxembourg before beginning a long acquaintance with the artist. George du Maurier's 1894 novel Trilby mentions such a scene, of people copying Ploughing in the Nivernais and other works in the Luxembourg. It is one of the paintings singled out by Margaret Addison on her European tour in 1900, though philosopher Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Paulhan in L'Esth\u00e9tique du paysage (1913) was less impressed; Paulhan argued that good art simplifies, and that Ploughing in the Nivernais does not do so, spoiling it with the execution of the clods of earth. Those clods and the greenery were done, according to Bonheur, in a \"heartwarming\" way, according to Paulhan; she did not create, but merely reproduced, since on the one hand she was too complete by providing too much insignificant detail, and on the other hand she weakened nature by reproducing it. Paul C\u00e9zanne was also unimpressed, commenting that \"it is horribly like the real thing\".\n", "\nArtist: Rosa Bonheur\nArtwork Name: The Horse Fair (reduced Version)\nArtwork Genre: animal painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rosa-bonheur/the-horse-fair-reduced-version-1855\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Horse Fair is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Rosa Bonheur, begun in 1852 and first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1853.

The painting depicts dealers selling horses at the horse market held on the Boulevard de l'H\u00f4pital in Paris. The notorious hospital of Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re can be seen in the left background.  The prime version of the painting has been in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York since 1887, when it was donated by Cornelius Vanderbilt II.  It is on view in Gallery 812.  Bonheur painted The Horse Fair from a series of sketches of Percherons, and other draft horses, which she had made at the Paris horse market\u00a0[fr] on the tree-lined Boulevard de l'H\u00f4pital, near the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital, which is visible in the background to the painting.  She attended the market twice weekly for a year and a half from summer of 1850 to the end of 1851.  She sought a permission de travestissement\u00a0[fr] from the Paris police to dress as a man, to avoid drawing attention to herself. She had earlier studied at a Paris slaughterhouse in 1845, a typical activity for an animal painter that she was the first woman to engage in, and had experienced harassment as a visible woman.

It depicts an Ancient Roman slave auction. It shows the marketing of seven young people, ranging in age from children to young adults, as slaves. Both male slaves, as well as three of the female slaves, bear a similarity in appearance perhaps suggesting that they are members of a family forced into slavery by economic conditions. All are wearing tags to indicate their availability as slaves. The youngest boy is completely naked, while the young man next to him is wearing a loincloth. The young woman sitting next to them is topless, wearing only a skirt, but she is covering her breasts with her legs. The standing African woman is also topless, wearing a white loincloth, and she is covering her breasts with her hands. The taller, standing, young woman is wearing a translucent garment which clearly shows her breasts and pubic hair\u2014she is trying to shield her eyes, perhaps because her potential buyers include former friends and neighbors, who are probably seeing her nude for the first time. The adolescent girl next to her is also topless and barefoot, wearing a skirt. The young woman sitting next to them is wearing a loose garment which leaves both her breasts and her genitals exposed. The auctioneer eats his lunch with a very casual attitude.\r From a common type of Salon academic art of the period, it depicts an eroticized scene clad as a history painting, as was customary at the time in Paris. Boulanger had visited Italy, Greece, and North Africa, and the painting reflects his attention to culturally correct details and skill in rendering the female form.\n", "\nArtist: Camille Pissarro\nArtwork Name: The Pont Boieldieu, Rouen, Damp Weather\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/camille-pissarro/the-pont-boieldieu-rouen-damp-weather-1896\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPont Boieldieu in Rouen, Rainy Weather is an 1896 painting by Camille Pissarro in the collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario. It is one of a series of painting Pissarro did of Pont Bo\u00efeldieu and the industrial quays surrounding it. Pissarro spent time in Rouen in 1896 seeking to paint the industrial modernity of the area. He had earlier made a trip in 1883, and did one series of images of the city then. On his 1896 trip he stayed at the H\u00f4tel de Paris in Rouen, from January to April 1896, and it is in this period that this painting was made. His room overlooked the Seine, and it is from this vantage point that it is painted.\r The subject is the Pont Boieldieu, an iron bridge completed a few years before in 1885. Across the river is the Gare d'Orl\u00e9ans train station and the Place Carnot square. The painting shows Pissarro's interest in moving beyond traditional landscape paintings of verdant rural scenes. His Rouen series instead focuses on the bustle of the modern city. The Rouen pictures would be followed by a series of paintings of urban Paris. Style-wise, Pont Boieldieu in Rouen, Rainy Weather is a return to Impressionism after a decade of experimenting with Post-Impressionism and Pointalism. Pissarro deliberately sought out a view of the busy industrial section of the town, and produced a number of paintings of the view from the hotel in different light conditions and different weather. He did another picture of the Pont Boieldieu from the same angle, but in a foggy sunset that is today at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Rouen.\r In a letter written that year, Pissarro himself describes the painting: \"The theme is the bridge near the Placede la Bourse with the effects of rain, crowds of people coming and going, smoke from the boats, quays with cranes, workers in the foreground, and all this in grey colors glistening in the rain.\" He further wrote, \"what particularly interests me is the motif off the iron bridge in wet weather with all the vehicles, pedestrians, workers on the embankment, boats, smoke, haze in the distance; it's so spirited, so alive.\r The painting was donated to the Art Gallery of Ontario by Reuben Wells Leonard upon his death in 1937. It is one of six Pissarros on public display in Canada, with two others at the AGO, and the others being at the National Gallery of Canada, Art Gallery of Hamilton and the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria.\n", "\nArtist: Camille Pissarro\nArtwork Name: Boulevard Montmartre Spring\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/camille-pissarro/boulevard-montmartre-spring-1897\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLe Boulevard de Montmartre, Matin\u00e9e de Printemps is an 1897 oil on canvas painting of Paris' Boulevard Montmartre by the French artist Camille Pissarro.\r By 1923 it was in the collection of the German industrialist and Holocaust victim Max Silberberg (de).

Little of Manet's earliest work survives and much may have been destroyed by Manet himself.\r The Absinthe Drinker is a full-length portrait of an alcoholic rag-and-bone man named Collardet who frequented the area around the Louvre in Paris. Collardet is painted in mostly brown, grey and black tones. The subject is standing, wears a black top hat and is wrapped in a brown cloak, like an aristocrat; he leans on a ledge with the empty bottle discarded on the floor by his feet. Manet later added a half-full glass of absinthe on the ledge. Influenced by the realism of Gustave Courbet, the work shows a mundane subject on a large scale, measuring 180.5 centimetres (71.1\u00a0in) high by 105.6 centimetres (41.6\u00a0in) wide. Manet may have taken inspiration from the poem Le Vin de chiffonniers (\"The rag-picker's wine\") in Charles Baudelaire's 1857 collection Les Fleurs du mal, from the paintings of ordinary people by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (particularly his paintings of Aesop and Menippus), and from Watteau's L'Indiff\u00e9rent.\r Near the completion of the painting, Manet showed the work to his former master. Asked for his opinion, Couture is said to have retorted: \"An absinthe drinker! And they paint abominations like that! My poor friend, you are the absinthe drinker. It is you who have lost your moral sense.\" (quoted, for example, in Lainer, and in Adams).\r The Absinthe Drinker was the first work that Manet submitted to the Paris Salon in 1859. It was rejected with only Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix voting in its favour. Part of the reason for its rejection may be its subject; absinthe was thought to be addictive and considered morally degenerate, and this was one of the earliest depictions of absinthe in art. The painting, however, also has technical faults; it is unevenly finished, with brushstrokes visible in places, and the legs join awkwardly with the subject's body. Refusal of other works by young painters led eventually to the creation of the Salon des Refus\u00e9s in 1863.\r Manet continued to revise the work after 1859 and inserted the same cloaked figure into his 1862 painting The Old Musician. The original full-length portrait was cut down to three-quarter length by 1867 when it was exhibited by Manet with 56 other works in a self-funded retrospective at the Exposition Universelle held in Paris, but extended again by 1872 when Manet sold The Absinthe Drinker and 23 other works to the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel. The glass of absinthe was a late addition, between 1867 and 1872.\r The painting was sold to opera singer Jean-Baptiste Faure in 1906 and exhibited at the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen in 1914 when it was acquired for the Ny Carlsberg Foundation. It was one of the first modern works added to the collection at the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, where it is still held.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: The Spanish Singer\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/the-spanish-singer-1860\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Spanish Singer is an 1860 oil painting on canvas by the French painter \u00c9douard Manet, conserved since 1949 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York.\r Composed in Manet's studio, it employed a model and props which were later used for at least one other painting. This work, both realistic and exotic in its depiction of its subject, exhibits the influence of Spanish art, especially that of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, on Manet's style. Manet, due to this painting, was accepted for the first time at the Salon of Paris in 1861, where he also exhibited a portrait of his parents.\r The Spanish Singer received positive criticism at the time and won a decent mention. It was appreciated by French writer Charles Baudelaire, and by French journalist and literary critic Theophile Gautier, who praised the painting for its \"very true color\" and \"vigorous brush\". Manet consequently became the leader of the avant-garde movement and inspired a group of young artists, including Henri Fantin-Latour and Carolus-Duran, who decided to visit Manet's studio.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Boy with a sword\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/boy-with-a-sword-1861\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBoy Carrying a Sword is an 1861 oil painting by the French artist \u00c9douard Manet and is now displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

It is jointly owned by the National Gallery, London and The Hugh Lane, Dublin. It currently hangs in the National Gallery in London.\r The work is an early example of Manet's painterly style, inspired by Frans Hals and Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, and it is a harbinger of his lifelong interest in the subject of leisure. The painting influenced Manet's contemporaries \u2013 such as Monet, Renoir and Bazille \u2013 to paint similar large groups of people.\r The painting depicts the gatherings of Parisians at weekly concerts in the Tuileries gardens near the Louvre, although no musicians are depicted. While the picture was regarded as unfinished by some, the suggested atmosphere imparts a sense of what the Tuileries gardens were like at the time; one may imagine the music and conversation.\r The iron chairs in the foreground had just replaced the wooden chairs in the garden in 1862. Manet has included several of his friends, artists, authors, and musicians who take part, and a self-portrait. Manet is depicted on the far left; next to him is another painter Albert de Balleroy. To their right, seated, is sculptor and critic Zacharie Astruc. Manet's brother Eug\u00e8ne Manet is in foreground, right of centre, with white trousers; the composer Jacques Offenbach with glasses and moustache sits against a tree to the right; critic Th\u00e9ophile Gautier stands against a tree in brown suit and full beard, while author Charles Baudelaire is to the left of Gautier. Henri Fantin-Latour is further left, with beard, looking at the viewer. The fair-haired child in the centre is L\u00e9on Leenhoff.\r The work measures 76.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0118.1 centimetres (30.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a046.5\u00a0in). It was first exhibited in 1863, and Manet sold the painting to opera singer and collector Jean-Baptiste Faure in 1883. It was sold on to dealer Durand-Ruel in 1898, and then to collector Sir Hugh Lane in 1903. After Lane's death, when RMS Lusitania was sunk in 1915, an unwitnessed codicil to his will left the painting to the Dublin City Gallery (now known as The Hugh Lane). The codicil was found to be invalid, and in 1917 a court case decided that his previous will left the work to the National Gallery in London. After intervention from the Irish government, the two galleries reached a compromise in 1959, agreeing to share the paintings, with half of the Lane Bequest lent and shown in Dublin every five years. The agreement was varied in 1993 so that 31 of the 39 paintings would stay in Ireland, and four of the remaining eight would be lent to Dublin for 6 years at a time.\r The colors in greater areas of this painting are generally subdued and executed in ochres or in mixtures of several pigments. The dark green foliage in the upper part contains a glaze of emerald green and Scheele's green mixed with yellow lake with small addition of ivory black and yellow ochre. The strong colourful accents in the bonets and clothes of the children are painted in almost pure pigments such as cobalt blue, vermilion or chrome orange.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: The old musician\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/the-old-musician-1862\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Old Musician is an 1862 oil painting on canvas by French painter \u00c9douard Manet, produced during the period when the artist was influenced by Spanish art. The painting also betrays the influence of Gustave Courbet. This work is one of Manet's largest paintings and is now conserved at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC.\r The painting is composed of seven characters in a landscape. The old musician in the center who is preparing to play the violin is Jean Lagr\u00e8ne, the leader of a local gypsy band. To the left is a young girl standing with a baby in her arms, as well as two young boys. In the background, the man in the top hat is the rag picker and ironmonger Colardet. At the right, the Oriental man (partly shown) with a turban and a long robe, represents Gu\u00e9roult, a \"wandering Jew\". Attitudes and clothes of the characters seem to be inspired by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez or Louis Le Nain. \r The painting contains a series of allusions: the man in the top hat is the same character as The Absinthe Drinker, painted by Manet some years earlier and who reappears in this painting without any particular reason. The young boy in straw hat, meanwhile, is explicitly inspired by Antoine Watteau's Pierrot.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Olympia\nArtwork Genre: nude painting (nu)\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/olympia-1863\n\nWikipedia Article:\nOlympia is a painting by \u00c9douard Manet, first exhibited at the 1865 Paris Salon, which shows a nude woman (\"Olympia\") lying on a bed being brought flowers by a servant. Olympia was modelled by Victorine Meurent and Olympia's servant by the art model Laure. Olympia's confrontational gaze caused shock and astonishment when the painting was first exhibited because a number of details in the picture identified her as a prostitute. The French government acquired the painting in 1890 after a public subscription organized by Claude Monet. The painting is on display at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris.\r What shocked contemporary audiences was not Olympia's nudity, nor the presence of her fully clothed maid, but her confrontational gaze and a number of details identifying her as a demi-mondaine or prostitute. These include the orchid in her hair, her bracelet, pearl earrings and the oriental shawl on which she lies, symbols of wealth and sensuality. The black ribbon around her neck, in stark contrast with her pale flesh, and her cast-off slipper underline the voluptuous atmosphere. \"Olympia\" was a name associated with prostitutes in 1860s Paris.\r The painting is modelled after Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538). Whereas the left hand of Titian's Venus is curled and appears to entice, Olympia's left hand appears to block, which has been interpreted as symbolic of her sexual independence from men and her role as a prostitute, granting or restricting access to her body in return for payment. Manet replaced the little dog (symbol of fidelity) in Titian's painting with a black cat, which traditionally symbolized prostitution. Olympia disdainfully ignores the flowers presented to her by her servant, probably a gift from a client. Some have suggested that she is looking in the direction of the door, as her client barges in unannounced.\r The painting deviates from the academic canon in its style, characterized by broad, quick brushstrokes, studio lighting that eliminates mid-tones, large color surfaces and shallow depth. Unlike the smooth idealized nude of Alexandre Cabanel's La naissance de V\u00e9nus, also painted in 1863, Olympia is a real woman whose nakedness is emphasized by the harsh lighting. The canvas alone is 51.4 x 74.8 inches, which is rather large for this genre-style painting. Most paintings that were this size depicted historical or mythological events, so the size of the work, among other factors, caused surprise. Finally, Olympia is fairly thin by the artistic standards of the time and her relatively undeveloped body is more girlish than womanly. Charles Baudelaire thought thinness more indecent than fatness.\r The model for Olympia, Victorine Meurent, became an accomplished painter in her own right.\r In part, the painting was inspired by Titian's Venus of Urbino (c. 1538), which in turn refers to Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510). L\u00e9once B\u00e9n\u00e9dite was the first art historian to explicitly acknowledge the similarity to the Venus of Urbino in 1897. There is also some similarity to Francisco Goya's La maja desnuda (c. 1800).\r There were also pictorial precedents for a nude woman, attended by a black servant, such as Ingres' Odalisque with a Slave (1842), L\u00e9on Benouville's Esther with Odalisque (1844) and Charles Jalabert's Odalisque (1842). Comparison is also made to Ingres' Grande Odalisque (1814). Unlike other artists, Manet did not depict a goddess or an odalisque but a high-class prostitute waiting for a client.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: The Luncheon on the Grass\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/the-luncheon-on-the-grass-1863\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLe D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe (English: The Luncheon on the Grass) \u2013 originally titled Le Bain (The Bath) \u2013 is a large oil on canvas painting by \u00c9douard Manet created in 1862 and 1863. It depicts a female nude and a scantily dressed female bather on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. Rejected by the Salon jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit this and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refus\u00e9s, where the painting sparked public notoriety and controversy. The piece is now in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris. A smaller, earlier version can be seen at the Courtauld Gallery, London.\r The painting features a nude woman casually lunching with two fully dressed men. Her body is starkly lit and she stares directly at the viewer. The two men, dressed as young dandies, seem to be engaged in conversation, ignoring the woman. In front of them, the woman's clothes, a basket of fruit, and a round loaf of bread are displayed, as in a still life. In the background, a lightly clad woman bathes in a stream. Too large in comparison with the figures in the foreground, she seems to float above them. The roughly painted background lacks depth, giving the viewer the impression that the scene is not taking place outdoors, but in a studio. This impression is reinforced by the use of broad \"studio\" light, which casts almost no shadows. The man on the right wears a flat hat with a tassel, a kind normally worn indoors.\r Despite the mundane subject, Manet deliberately chose a large canvas size, measuring 81.9 x 104.1\u00a0in (208 by 264.5 cm), normally reserved for historical, religious, and mythological subjects. The style of the painting breaks with the academic traditions of the time. He did not try to hide the brush strokes; the painting even looks unfinished in some parts of the scene. The nude is also starkly different from the smooth, flawless figures of Cabanel or Ingres.\r A nude woman casually lunching with fully dressed men was an affront to audiences' sense of propriety, though \u00c9mile Zola, a contemporary of Manet's, argued that this was not uncommon in paintings found in the Louvre. Zola also felt that such a reaction came from viewing art differently than \"analytic\" painters like Manet, who use a painting's subject as a pretext to paint.\r There is much still not known about the painting, such as when Manet actually began painting it, exactly how he got the idea, and how and what sort of preparation works he did. Though Manet had claimed this piece was once valued at 25,000 Francs in 1871, it actually remained in his possession until 1878 when Jean-Baptiste Faure, opera-singer and collector, bought it for just 2,600 Francs.\r The figures of this painting are a testament to how deeply connected Manet was to Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l\u2019herbe. Some assume that the landscape of the painting is meant to be l\u2019\u00eele Saint-Ouen, which was just up the Seine from his family property in Gennevilliers. Manet often used real models and people he knew as reference during his creation process. The female nude is thought to be Victorine Meurent, the woman who became his favorite and frequently portrayed model, who later was the subject of Olympia. The male figure on the right was based on a combination of his two brothers, Eug\u00e8ne and Gustave Manet. The other man is based on his brother-in-law, Dutch sculptor Ferdinand Leenhoff\u00a0(nl). Nancy Locke referred to this scene as Manet\u2019s family portrait.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Battle of Kearsage and Alabama\nArtwork Genre: battle painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/battle-of-kearsage-and-alabama-1864\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Battle of the Kearsarge and the Alabama is an 1864 oil painting by \u00c9douard Manet.

It is currently kept in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris, and is now on loan to the Louvre Abu Dhabi museum in Abu Dhabi, UAE.\r On a trip to Spain in 1865, \u00c9douard Manet visited the Prado, where the art of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez was a revelation. Upon his return to Paris in 1866, he began work on a new painting, depicting an anonymous regimental fifer of the Spanish army. In this picture, Manet presents the uniformed boy, in a manner that imitates and inverts the formula of V\u00e9lazquez's court portraits, against a barely inflected, flattened background of neutral tone, thus frustrating attempts to assess the figure's true size and, by extension, importance.\r The painting, entitled Le fifre, was rejected by the jury of the Salon of 1866. Outraged by the jury's decision, \u00c9mile Zola, an early champion of Manet's art, published a series of articles in the newspaper L'\u00c9venement, that praised Manet's realist style and modern content. Following the example of Gustave Courbet, in May 1867, Manet personally funded and mounted an exhibition of his own work in a pavilion at the edge of the \u00c9xposition universelle. The exhibition included Le fifre, which was ridiculed in the popular press for its unusual brushwork and inscrutable spatial setting.\r The painting was acquired by Durand-Ruell in 1872 and again in 1893. Between 1873 and 1893, the painting was owned by Manet's friend, composer and baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure. Le fifre was accepted by the French government in lieu of taxes on the estate of its last private owner, the Count Isaac de Camondo, and entered the national collections in 1911. It was displayed at the Louvre from 1914 until 1947, when it was relocated to the Mus\u00e9e du Jeu de Paume. In 1986, it was moved to its current home in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, the national museum of 19th-century art.\r It was included in a large exhibition of Manet's work in 1884, a year after his premature death, and was included in the sweeping Manet retrospective held at the Grand Palais in 1983, the 100th anniversary of the artist's death.\r As in the painting by Spanish painter, Manet conceived a shallow depth, where vertical and horizontal planes are barely distinguishable. According to Peter H. Feist, in The Player fife, Manet showed the attraction for \"the decorative effect of a large single figures, with emphatic contours and placed before a background surface.\" Before the monochrome background, the figure is strongly highlighted but based on a reduced palette of colors, dominated by the impasto technique: the very sharp black of the jacket and shoes, red pants, white strap, etc.. As a result, the figure stands \"firm, smooth and alive.\"\r Moreover, as in Vel\u00e1zquez's work, Manet also portrayed an anonymous character, a teenage musician of the band of the Imperial Guard of Napoleon III, who was sent to Manet by commander Lejosne, \"treated like a grandee of Spain.\" Additional models may have also posed for the figure: the likenesses of both L\u00e9on Leenhoff and Victorine Meurent have been seen in the boy's face and figure.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Races at Longchamp\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/races-at-longchamp\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Races at Longchamp is an 1866 painting by the French artist \u00c9douard Manet.

Partially a portrait of 16-year-old L\u00e9on Leenhoff \u2014 the son of Suzanne Leenhoff before her 1863 marriage to Manet, and possibly the son of Manet or Manet's father Auguste \u2014 it is also an enigmatic work that has received limited attention within Manet's oeuvre. Critic Nan Stalnaker notes that \"despite continued questions about its meaning, the work is acknowledged to be brilliantly painted and a major Manet work\".\r In the summer of 1868 Manet traveled to Boulogne-sur-Mer for his summer vacation, where he painted Luncheon in the Studio and other works. Luncheon was posed in the dining room of Manet's rented house.\r Leenhoff is the focus of the painting, with his back to the other two people, who have at various points been identified as his mother and Manet. These identifications are now seen as incorrect; the man seated at the table, smoking a cigar and enjoying a coffee and a digestif, is anonymous\u2014although he bears a resemblance to Manet (his friend, the painter Auguste Rousselin has also been suggested). The woman gazing toward the viewer is a servant. Given the uncertain status of Leenhoff's paternity, Meyers proposes that the two figures may nevertheless represent Suzanne and \u00c9douard symbolically, specifically \"their belated recognition and acceptance of Auguste [Manet]'s son\".\r In an otherwise muted color scheme, the yellow in Leenhoff's tie, pants, and straw hat connect with the lemon on the table. The armour that appears incongruently in the bottom-left corner recalls its symbolism and collectibility before and during the Second Empire, when it was also the subject of still lifes. The table holds more conventional subjects of the genre, including a peeled lemon, oysters, a Delft sugar bowl, and a knife that protrudes off the table. In this way Manet represents both the \"romantic\" and \"naturalistic\" modes of his art, according to Collins, who also notes, given the presence of the man in the background, that smoking was popular among \"young romantics\".\r The painting was exhibited in the 1869 Paris Salon along with Manet's The Balcony, another work that lacked a simple genre affiliation, and in which at least one of the figures seems to confront the viewer as if challenging the \"fourth wall\". Both pieces were found wanting by art critics of the day; by this time a common criticism of Manet was that his goal was to \"attract attention at any price\". The reviewer Jules-Antoine Castagnary criticized the two paintings in a quote that well reflects the conventional expectations of a painting in this period, just before the further turbulence that Impressionism brought upon art:\r Another critic, Marius Chaumelin, echoed this sentiment (speaking of both paintings): \"The personages... are not at all handsome [except for the seated woman in The Balcony, Berthe Morisot], their faces having something morose and disagreeable about them, like the faces of persons who pose, and in fact all these figures have the air of saying to us: Look at me!... Thus, no expression, no feeling, no composition.\" He spoke of \"types without character, scenes devoid of all interest\" and said disparagingly (yet insightfully from the point of view of modern criticism) that \"Manet had made the portrait of a Balcony and a Luncheon\".\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Emile Zola\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/portrait-of-emile-zola-1868\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of \u00c9mile Zola is a painting of \u00c9mile Zola by \u00c9douard Manet.

Manet produced three large oil paintings, a smaller oil sketch and a lithograph of the same subject. All five works were brought together for an exhibition in London and Mannheim in 1992\u201393, and at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2006.\r Maximilian was born in 1832, the son of Archduke Franz Karl of Austria and Princess Sophie of Bavaria. After a career in the Austrian Navy, he was encouraged by Napoleon III to become Emperor of Mexico following the French intervention in Mexico. Maximilian arrived in Mexico in May 1864. He faced significant opposition from forces loyal to the deposed president Benito Ju\u00e1rez throughout his reign, and the Empire collapsed after Napoleon withdrew French troops in 1866. Maximilian was captured in May 1867, sentenced to death at a court martial, and executed with Generals Miguel Miram\u00f3n and Tom\u00e1s Mej\u00eda on 19 June 1867.\r Manet supported the Republican cause, but nonetheless was inspired to start work on a painting heavily influenced by Goya's The Third of May 1808. The final work, painted in 1868\u201369 is now held by the Kunsthalle Mannheim. The painting is signed by Manet in the lower left corner but bears the date of Maximilian's execution in 1867 despite being painted in 1868\u201369.\r Fragments of an earlier and larger painting from about 1867\u201368 are held by the National Gallery in London. Parts of this work were probably cut off by Manet, but it was largely complete on his death; other parts were sold separately after his death. The surviving pieces were reassembled by Edgar Degas and they were bought by the National Gallery in 1918, but then separated again until 1979 and finally combined on one canvas in 1992.\r A third, unfinished oil painting is held by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, donated from Mr. and Mrs. Frank Gair Macomber in 1930, who bought it from Ambroise Vollard in 1909. A much smaller work in oils, a study for the Mannheim painting, is held by the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen. Manet was refused permission to reproduce the lithograph in 1869, but an edition of 50 impressions was produced in 1884, after his death. Examples of the lithograph are held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts.\r In the Boston version of the painting, the soldiers wear clothes and sombrero of Mexican Republicans. In the final version in Mannheim, they are dressed in 19th century field dress, common to many armies at that time, but Manet recognized the irony that they could be easily mistaken for French soldiers in this picture. The sergeant wearing a red cap clearly resembles Napoleon III (in reality, the execution was bungled, and a Coup de gr\u00e2ce was required).\r Political sensitivities made it impossible for Manet to exhibit his paintings in France during the reign of Napoleon III, but the Mannheim version was exhibited in New York and Boston in 1879\u201380, brought there by Manet's friend, the opera singer \u00c9milie Ambre. The Mannheim and Boston versions were exhibited together at the Salon d'Automne in 1905. The Mannheim version was acquired by the Kunsthalle Mannheim in 1910 after being exhibited at the Berliner Secession earlier that year.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: The Balcony\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/the-balcony-1869\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Balcony (French: Le balcon) is an 1868-69 oil painting by the French painter \u00c9douard Manet. The painting depicts four figures on a balcony, one sitting and the others standing. Seated on the left is the painter Berthe Morisot, who became the wife of Manet's brother, Eug\u00e8ne in 1874. In the centre is the painter Jean Baptiste Antoine Guillemet. On the right is Fanny Claus, a violinist. The fourth figure, partially obscured in the interior's background, is possibly L\u00e9on Leenhoff, Manet's son. It was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1869, and then kept by Manet until his death in 1883. It was sold to the painter Gustave Caillebotte in 1884, who left it to the French state in 1894. It is currently held at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, in Paris.\r The painting, inspired by Majas on the Balcony\u00a0(fr) by Francisco Goya, was created at the same time and with the same purpose as Luncheon in the Studio.\r The three characters, who were all friends of Manet, seem to be disconnected from each other: while Berthe Morisot, on the left, looks like a romantic and inaccessible heroine, the young violinist Fanny Claus and the painter Antoine Guillemet seem to display indifference. The boy in the background is probably Manet's son, L\u00e9on. Just behind the railings, there are a hydrangea in a ceramic pot, and a dog with a ball below Morisot's chair.\r This was the first portrait of Morisot by Manet. Manet adopts a retrained colour palette, dominated by white, green and black, with a accents of blue (Guillemet's tie) and red (Morisot's fan).\r Manet made many preparatory studies, painting the four subjects individually many times: Guillemet as many as fifteen times. A preparatory study for The Balcony was painted at Boulogne in 1868. This unfinished portrait of Fanny Claus, the closest friend of Manet\u2019s wife Suzanne Leenhoff; Claus married Manet's friend Pierre Prins in 1869. The work was bought after Manet's death in a studio sale by John Singer Sargent. The portrait had only been seen once in public since it was first painted in 1868, but in 2012 the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford succeeded in raising the funds to acquire it and keep it permanently in a public collection in the United Kingdom.\r The painting was not well received when it was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1869. The aggressive and bold green of the balcony rails drew much attention, as evidenced by the article devoted to the work by the Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si\u00e8cle in 1878 which stated: \"This painting was exhibited at the Salon of 1869 and is one of those who contributed to form this reputation for eccentricity realistic, this reputation of bad taste that was attached to Mr. Manet.\" The press considered the painting as \"discordant\". The contrast of colours (the background completely black, the white faces and clothes, the blue tie of the man, and the green railings) contributes to create an atmosphere of \"mystery\".\r Manet deliberately eschewed any sense of connection between the figures, treating them more like objects in a still life than living people. None of them looks at the others. One commentator, the caricaturist Cham, sarcastically called for the shutters to be closed. Morisot herself said \"Je suis plus \u00e9trange que laide; il para\u00eet que l'\u00e9pith\u00e8te de femme fatale a circul\u00e9 parmi les curieux (\"I look more peculiar than ugly; it seems that people asking about it have used the words femme fatale to describe me.\"). Albert Wolff described it as \"coarse art\"\" at \"the level of house painters\".\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: The reading\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/the-reading-1869\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Reading is an oil painting by French painter \u00c9douard Manet, circa 1865 - 1873.\r The painting was first exhibited in 1880 in one of the regular solo exhibitions mounted by Manet in his workshop. The picture was also part of the great posthumous exhibition of Manet's work in 1884, a year after his death.\r The work first belonged to the private collection of Winnaretta Singer, Princess Edmond de Polignac, where it remained until 1944, after the death of the Princess. It was offered as a gift to the French State and deposited in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. In 1947, it was transferred to the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume, a showroom located in the Jardin des Tuileries and which belongs to the Louvre. It remained there until 1986, when, with the creation of the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, it was brought to this museum, like the rest of the collection of Impressionist paintings in the Louvre. It can currently be seen in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, in room 31 of level 5.\r The painting depicts the artist's wife, Suzanne Manet (born Suzanne Leenhoff), seated, and their son, Leon, standing and reading a book. Leon was a recurrent model for Manet who portrayed him in several pictures, such as The Lunch, The Boy Carrying a Sword and The Bubbles of Soap.\r In this work the white woman's dress dominates, and the sofa and curtains are treated with broad strokes of high brightness, in counterpoint to the dark tone of the belt and collar. According to Peter H. Feist, in this painting \"Manet reacts more sensitive than usual, and looks especially to shades of white that are offered to his eyes\".\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Effect of Snow at Petit-Montrouge\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/effect-of-snow-at-petit-montrouge-1870\n\nWikipedia Article:\nEffect of Snow on Petit-Montrouge (French: Effet de neige \u00e0 Petit-Montrouge) is an 1870 landscape painting by the French painter \u00c9douard Manet.\r The oil on canvas painting shows a winter view of Petit-Montrouge, an area in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. Manet painted this picture while a member of the National Guard during the 1870\u201371 Siege of Paris of the Franco-Prussian War. As opposed to the history painters of his time, Manet does not show a heroic view of battle, but rather the dusky ambiance of a looming battle. The image reflects Manet's loss of hope about the military situation, his profound loneliness, and the deprivation he suffered during this time. It is one of the few landscapes in Manet's oeuvre, and is one of Manet's first plein air paintings. Today it is in the collection of the National Museum Cardiff.\r Manet uses earthly and muted tones to illustrate an urban snow landscape; between the large peaks of white and diagonals of murky brown the Paris district of Petit-Montrouge is illustrate, overshadowed by the brown dirty snow and bleak beige sky.

It depicts fellow painter Berthe Morisot dressed in black mourning dress, with a barely visible bouquet of violets. The painting, sometimes known as Portrait of Berthe Morisot, Berthe Morisot in a black hat or Young woman in a black hat, is in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris. Manet also created an etching and two lithographs of the same composition.\r Manet became acquainted with Berthe Morisot in 1868. She was the grand-niece of Fragonard, and also a painter; Morisot and Manet influenced each other's work. He painted her portrait many times, including his earlier work The Balcony. She married Manet's brother Eug\u00e8ne in 1874.\r Manet had remained in Paris during the Franco-Prussian War 1870-71, and served in the Garde Nationale to defend the city in the Siege of Paris. He was unable to paint while he was serving, and left Paris after the city surrendered at the end of January 1871. He returned to painting later in 1871, and returned to Paris after the defeat of the Paris Commune in May 1871.\r This painting was one of several portraits of a black-clad Morisot by Manet in 1872-74: others show her with a pink shoe, with a fan, and veiled.\r The half-length portrait is on a canvas measuring 55.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a040.5 centimetres (21.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015.9\u00a0in) \u2014 71.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a057.5 centimetres (28.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a022.6\u00a0in) with frame \u2014 and is signed \"Manet 72\" in the upper right corner. It is a study in shades of black. Unusually for Manet's portraits, which typically have an even light, Morisot is lit from one side, so that she is brightly illuminated on her right side and the left is in deep shadow. She wears black mourning dress and hat, with her face surrounded by black ribbons and scarves, against a lighter background, and an earring in each ear. The violet flowers are barely perceptible where the neckline of Morisot's dress dips towards her chest. Manet also painted violets in his Woman with a Parrot of 1866.\r Manet painted Morisot with black eyes, although her eyes were actually green. The dark costume and eyes may allude to Manet's impression that she looked Spanish. Manet had earlier painted a similar portrait of his own mother in mourning, made in 1863, which shows his mother clad in black, on a dark background.\r The painting was followed by a similar etching - probably the first copy, with the pose reversed - and two lithographs, all made in 1872 to 1874. Manet made a similar painting of Morisot in mourning dress in 1874, after the death of her father, Edm\u00e9 Tiburce Morisot.\r The work was quickly considered a masterpiece of Manet's work. It was praised by Paul Val\u00e9ry in the catalogue of Manet's retrospective at the Orangerie in 1932 for the centenary of his birth. Val\u00e9ry knew the painting well: he was married to Morisot's niece, Jeannie Gobillard, the daughter of Morisot's sister Yves and her husband Theodore Gobillard, and so he also related by marriage to Manet; indeed, his wedding in 1900 was a double celebration at the same time as the marriage of Morisot's daughter Julie Manet to Ernest Rouart. Val\u00e9ry compared Manet's painting to Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring: \"I do not rank anything in Manet's work higher than a certain portrait of Berthe Morisot dated 1872\".\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Railway\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/railway-1873\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Railway, widely known as Gare Saint-Lazare, is an 1873 painting by \u00c9douard Manet. It is the last painting by Manet of his favourite model, the fellow painter Victorine Meurent, who was also the model for his earlier works Olympia and the Luncheon on the Grass. It was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1874, and donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1956.\r Meurent is depicted sitting to the left side of the frame, in front of an iron fence near the Gare Saint-Lazare in Paris. The pensive subject is wearing a dark hat and sombre deep blue dress with white details, and is looking towards the viewer, while a sleeping puppy, a fan and an open book rest in her lap. Next to her is a little girl, modelled by the daughter of Manet's neighbour Alphonse Hirsch, a contrasting figure wearing a white dress with large blue bow, standing her back to the viewer, watching through the railings as a train passes beneath them. The black band in the girl's hair echoes the black band around the neck of the woman. Instead of choosing the traditional natural view as background for an outdoor scene, Manet opted for the iron grating which \"boldly stretches across the canvas\" (Gay 106). The only evidence of the train is its white cloud of steam. Modern apartment buildings can be seen in the background, including the house on the Rue de Saint-P\u00e9tersbourg, near the Place de l'Europe, where Manet had rented a studio since July 1872, and also a signal box and the Pont de l'Europe.\r The arrangement compresses the foreground into a narrow focus, separated from the background by the row of railings. The traditional convention of deep space is ignored. Resting on a parapet to the right of the painting is a bunch of grapes, perhaps indicating that the painting was made in the autumn. The dog may be a reference to Titian's Venus of Urbino; Manet had earlier echoed Titian's composition in his Olympia.\r Historian Isabelle Dervaux has described the reception this painting received when it was first exhibited at the official Paris Salon of 1874: \"Visitors and critics found its subject baffling, its composition incoherent, and its execution sketchy. Caricaturists ridiculed Manet's picture, in which only a few recognized the symbol of modernity that it has become today\". The painting is currently in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\r Shortly after it was completed, the painting was sold to baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure. It was sold in 1881 for 5,400 francs to the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, who gave it several names: Enfant regardant le chemin de fer, Le pont de l'Europe, A la Gare St. Lazare, and later just Gare St. Lazare. It was sold on 31 December 1898 for 100,000 francs to American Henry Osborne Havemeyer. His wife Louisine Havemeyer left 2,000 artworks to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York on her death in 1929, but she divided a small collection, including The Railway, among her three children. The painting was donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1956 on the death of her son Horace Havemeyer.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Nana\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/nana-1877\n\nWikipedia Article:\nNana is a painting by French painter \u00c9douard Manet. It was completed in 1877 and was refused at the Salon of Paris the same year. The work is now at the Kunsthalle Hamburg art museum in Germany.\r The painting shows a young and beautiful woman who stands before a mirror with two extinguished candles, her face turned to the spectator. Her dress is incomplete; she wears a white chemise, blue corset, silk stockings and high-heeled footwear. The interior suggests that it is a boudoir. Behind the woman is a sofa with two pillows. An elegantly dressed man, sitting on the sofa, can be partly seen on the right of the painting. On the left side, there is a chair, a table and a flowerpot.\r Both the title and the numerous details suggest that the picture represents a high class prostitute and her client. \"Nana\" was a popular assumed name for female prostitutes during the second half of the 19th century (much like the connotation \"Candy\" has had for English-speakers more recently). Even today the French word \"nana\" is used to describe a frivolous woman (or simply \"a female\" in argot).\r Manet wanted to present the painting at the Salon of Paris but it was rejected because it was deemed to be contemptuous of the morality of the time. French society was not prepared for such frank depictions of prostitution, and the critics did not see the artistic qualities of the work and concentrated solely on the scene which was represented. One of the defenders of Manet was \u00c9mile Zola who in 1880 published a novel of the same name as the ninth volume of Les Rougon-Macquart series. However, there is no clear evidence of mutual inspiration in the choice of the theme and the title as the book was published three years later. Perhaps Manet found inspiration in L'Assommoir, Zola's previous book, in which the character of Nana appears for the first time.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Plum\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/plum-1878\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Plum (French: La Prune) - also known as Plum Brandy - is an oil-on-canvas painting by \u00c9douard Manet. It is undated but thought to have been painted about 1877.\r The painting is a study in loneliness, depicting a quiet, almost melancholy, scene of a young working girl seated in a caf\u00e9. The subject is viewed from nearby, perhaps by another seated customer. She may be a prostitute waiting for a client, or possibly a shop worker hoping for some conversation. On the table is a plum soaked in brandy, a speciality of Parisian caf\u00e9s at the time (originally painted as a glass of beer), which gives the painting its title. She may be waiting for a waiter to bring a spoon to eat her plum. The plum may be a reference to the woman's sexuality, as the fruit was later used in James Joyce's Ulysses. She leans forward, with her cheek resting on her right hand, and her right elbow on the marble tabletop, looking into the distance with a blank pensive look. Her left hand rests on the table holding an unlit cigarette. She wears a pink dress with embroidered cuffs, a white blouse, and a black hat draped with silk and lace. Her head is framed by the decorative grille behind her, above the red upholstered banquette on which she sits.\r Manet may have based the painting on observations at the Caf\u00e9 de la Nouvelle Ath\u00e8nes on the Place Pigalle in Paris. However, the background - the decorative grille and its gold frame - does not match other depictions of the caf\u00e9, and suggests the painting was made in Manet\u2019s studio, where he is known to have had a caf\u00e9-style marble table on iron legs. Manet uses a simple style: for example, the plum in its glass and the fingers of the woman's left hand are created with just a few dabs of colour.\r The model is the actress Ellen Andr\u00e9e, who was also depicted with Marcellin Desboutin in the similar 1876 painting L'Absinthe (or In a Caf\u00e9) by Edgar Degas. The similarities between the two paintings suggest that Manet's The Plum may be a response to Degas's L'Absinthe. Degas's painting shows a bleak scene of despair blunted by absinthe; Manet's is a more hopeful scene, where there is the chance that the sitter's loneliness may be broken. Andr\u00e9e also appears in Renoir's 1881 painting Luncheon of the Boating Party. Edward Hopper's 1927 painting Automat has a similar theme.\r The painting measures 73.6 centimetres (29.0\u00a0in) by 50.2 centimetres (19.8\u00a0in). Manet sold the painting to collector Charles Deudon in about 1881. It was inherited by Deudon's wife on his death in 1914 and sold before 1919. It came into the collection of Arthur Sachs and was then sold by M. Knoedler & Co to Paul Mellon in 1961. It was donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC in 1971.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: At the Cafe-Concert\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/at-the-cafe-concert\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Caf\u00e9-Concert is an 1879 painting by the French painter \u00c9douard Manet, who often captured caf\u00e9 scenes depicting social life at the end of the nineteenth century similar to those depicted in this painting.\r The setting has been identified as the Brasserie Reichshoffen on the Boulevard Rochechouart. Manet shows us men and women in the new brasseries and cafes of Paris, which presents the viewer with an alternate view of new Parisian life. Manet claimed he was painting \u201cdes oeuvres sinceres\u201d or \u201csincere works\u201d. The women depicted in these scenes were courting certain risks with regards to perception and morality.\r In The Caf\u00e9-Concert, Manet presents a caf\u00e9-concert in which three central figures form a triangle but are all engaged in opposite directions. The scene of a caf\u00e9-concert, supposedly casual, is hinted by Manet to be one of separation. The waitress enjoys a beer, while the woman at the bar smokes a cigarette and appears subdued and the man appears to be at ease as he watches the performance (the singer known as \u201cLa Belle Polonaise\u201d is reflected in the mirror in the background of the painting). It is noted that the man evokes confidence, because men unlike women could frequent caf\u00e9\u2019s without insecurity. The painting was posed and completed in a studio but gives the appearance of being freshly observed.\r In this painting, concepts of conventional composition are rejected. The figures of the individuals represented are not clearly defined but modeled with brushstrokes. The colors are placed directly on the canvas with loose, repetitive strokes instead of applying layers of pigments and glazes over a dark background.\r Currently, The Caf\u00e9-Concert is being featured in Off the Wall, an open-air exhibition on the streets of Baltimore, Maryland. A reproduction of the painting, the original is part of The Walters Art Museum collection, will be on display at the CFG Community Bank (Fell's Point). The National Gallery in London began the concept of bringing art out of doors in 2007 and the Detroit Institute of Art introduced the concept in the U.S.. The Off the Wall reproductions of the Walters' paintings are done on weather-resistant vinyl and include a description of the painting and a QR code for smart phones.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Self Portrait with a Palette\nArtwork Genre: self-portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/self-portrait-with-a-palette-1879\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSelf-Portrait with Palette (French: Autoportrait \u00e0 la palette) is an 1878\u201379 oil-on-canvas painting by the French artist \u00c9douard Manet. This late impressionistic work is one of his two self-portraits. Velasquez's self-portrait in Las Meninas was a particular inspiration for Manet's painting which despite its allusion to the previous artist's work is very modern in its focus upon the personality of the artist and loose paint handling.\r A long series of prominent collectors have owned this painting. Most recently, it sold for $29.48 million at Sotheby's on 22 June 2010.\r The 83 \u00d7 67\u00a0cm (33 \u00d7 26 in) painting shows a half-length portrait of the painter \u00c9douard Manet. In this self-portrait as painter he depicted himself as a stylish Boulevardier in front of a dark background. The depicted wears a black top hat and a brown jacket, under which is a white shirt, of which only the collar can be seen. The neckline of the suit jacket covers a black silk tie which is affixed by a tie pin. In the right, only vaguely depicted hand he holds a long wooden brush with red paint on the tip; the left hand holds a painting palette with about three more brushes. No further accessories are shown. The figure is lit from the left by which the shadows beneath the left arm and the right half of the face are created. His pose is slightly turned to the right, so that the right half of the body is darker than the forward, left half. The painter's gaze is directed forwards at the viewer.\r Because Manet was almost certainly not left-handed, the painting is a mirror image.\r As has been established by X-ray analysis, Manet painted his Self-Portrait with Palette over a portrait in profile of his wife Suzanne Manet. In this picture she was depicted in a pose similar to that in the painting Madame Manet at the Piano (1868, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay).\r The dating of the painting goes back to Manet's friend Th\u00e9odore Duret, who asked L\u00e9on Leenhof, the son of Manet's wife, about it after the painter's death. Moreover, Manet had used the same suit jacket that he wore in Self-Portrait with Palette in the painting At \"P\u00e8re Lathuille\" (also from 1879), for the depiction of the son of the restaurant's owner.\r Las Meninas, in which Diego Vel\u00e1zquez depicted himself in a similar pose with brush and palette, is considered an important precedent for the Self-Portrait with Palette. There the painter stands almost in the background of his studio, while his models, the five-year-old Margarita Teresa of Spain and her servants, occupy the foreground. From here Manet appropriated the pose of the painter and his equipment, but as opposed to Vel\u00e1zquez, he makes himself the thematic center of the image. At the same time, however, he is working on a painting, but leaves its subject matter, as well as his surroundings, to the imagination of the viewer. Manet himself between 1865 and 1870 portrayed Vel\u00e1zquez in a studio scene in which the Spanish painter is posed similarly to his self-portrait.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: The conservatory\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/the-conservatory-1879\n\nWikipedia Article:\nIn the Conservatory (French: Dans la serre) is an 1879 oil painting by \u00c9douard Manet in the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin, depicting Manet's friends, a couple, in a conservatory. There is an ambiguity in the painting that has led art critics to characterize the couple's relationship in divergent ways.\r The setting is a conservatory at 70 Rue d'Amsterdam in Paris, then owned by painter Otto Rosen and which Manet used as a studio for nine months in 1878 and 1879. Such a conservatory may have been more than a greenhouse; French painter Alix-Louise Enault's Consolation depicted the Parisian conservatory as a \"luxuriously decorated and intimate locale\u2014a secluded indoor area conducive to private rendezvous\". At first glance, we see a double portrait of a fashionable and attractive couple of some social rank. They are Manet's friends, the Guillemets, who owned a clothing shop. Their married status is conveyed by their rings, and the proximity of their hands is the nearest hint of intimacy. The woman becomes the focus of the portrait, however, being more prominently placed and colourfully dressed. Their physical separation\u2014with the husband Jules slouching in dark clothing behind the bench\u2014their lack of engagement with the viewer, and their abstract gazes create a sense of detachment, which has been the primary theme in modern criticism of the work.\r The interplay of lines formally defines the work. The woman has an erect posture echoed by the vertical slats of the bench, and the man, though leaning forward, does not break that vertical. The bench continues off the right side, reinforcing the horizontal and the separation of foreground and background. The diagonal pleats on the woman's dress provide some relief from the linearity of the composition.\r Since the painting's exhibition, critics have interpreted the couple's relationship diversely. Huysmans called the subjects \"marvelously detached from the envelope of green surrounding them\". As Collins summarizes:\r The painting was exhibited in the 1879 Paris Salon and was regarded as surprisingly conservative for Manet. Jules-Antoine Castagnary wrote, with tongue in cheek, \"But what is this? Face and hands more carefully drawn than usual: is Manet making concessions to the public?\"\u2014and said it portrayed \"the elegance of fashionable life\".\r Manet's Chez le P\u00e8re Lathuille (see Gallery), having similar subjects and painted later in the same year, may be seen as a companion to In the Conservatory. It was not included in the 1879 Salon.\r Jean-Baptiste Faure bought In the Conservatory from Manet, along with three other paintings, for the \"paltry sum\" of 11,000 francs. In 1896 the Deutsche Nationalgalerie in Berlin purchased it, becoming the first museum worldwide that purchased a picture of Manet.\r In 1945 by the end of the Second World War In the Conservatory was among the objects evacuated from the German National Gallery and the Berlin State Museums and put for safekeeping in a mine in Merkers. After the war the picture was discovered and secured by the Monuments Men. Its salvage was documented in several photographs which show soldiers from the U.S. Army posing with Manet\u2019s painting in the mine in Merkers. These photographs have gained iconographic status over the years and are often falsely used as an illustration of Nazi looted art in prestigious publications like the Deutsche Welle, The Washington Post, The New York Times and even in academic papers.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: The Suicide\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/the-suicide\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLe Suicid\u00e9 is a small oil painting by \u00c9douard Manet, completed between 1877 and 1881. The painting has been little studied within Manet's oeuvre, as if art historians have had difficulty finding a place for the work within the development of Manet's art.\r The pictorial content of the painting is limited to a man who appears to have just shot himself\u2014still holding a gun while slouched on a bed\u2014and a few pieces of furniture. Manet has removed the trappings of earlier depictions of suicide, and provided next to no narrative content or \"moralizing tendency\". Ilg associates the painting with the realism of Gustave Courbet, noting that Courbet also used a depiction of death in his Burial at Ornans (1849\u201350), a work that Courbet later indicated marked the beginning of his new artistic approach.\r The realism of Le Suicid\u00e9 has fueled speculation that it depicts an actual suicide, but the subject, if any, is not known. Speculation has concerned an assistant of Manet who committed suicide in Manet's studio more than a decade earlier. Another suicide proposed to be connected with the painting was that of an artist whom \u00c9mile Zola had written about in 1866. Recent critics have downplayed these associations.\r Manet's approach to this depiction may represent his continuing desire to break from academic tradition, in which a depiction of suicide could only fit within the genre of history painting\u2014where death and suicide would be placed within a narrative associated with sacrifice, idealism, or heroism. Examples in the French language include The Death of Socrates (1787) by Jacques-Louis David, which depicts Socrates' choice to kill himself by hemlock rather than go into exile. There is no such grand statement underlying Manet's painting. The artist has not given us a time, a place, or a protagonist. The painting is plainly constructed rather than carefully styled. This departure from tradition would have been controversial with contemporary viewers.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: A Bar at the Folies-Bergere\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/a-bar-at-the-folies-bergere-1882-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nA Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re (French: Un bar aux Folies Berg\u00e8re), painted and exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1882, is considered the last major work of French painter \u00c9douard Manet. It depicts a scene in the Folies Berg\u00e8re nightclub in Paris. The painting originally belonged to the composer Emmanuel Chabrier, who was Manet's neighbor. Chabrier hung it over his piano. The painting is currently in The Courtauld Gallery in London, England.\r The painting exemplifies Manet's commitment to Realism in its detailed representation of a contemporary scene. Many features have puzzled critics but almost all of them have been shown to have a rationale, and the painting has been the subject of numerous popular and scholarly articles.\r The central figure stands before a mirror, although critics\u2014accusing Manet of ignorance of perspective and alleging various impossibilities in the painting\u2014have debated this point since the earliest reviews were published. In 2000, however, a photograph taken from a suitable point of view of a staged reconstruction was shown to reproduce the scene as painted by Manet. According to this reconstruction, \"the conversation that many have assumed was transpiring between the barmaid and gentleman is revealed to be an optical trick\u2014the man stands outside the painter's field of vision, to the left, and looks away from the barmaid, rather than standing right in front of her.\" As it appears, the observer should be standing to the right and closer to the bar than the man whose reflection appears at the right edge of the picture. This is an unusual departure from the central point of view usually assumed when viewing pictures drawn according to perspective.\r Asserting the presence of the mirror has been crucial for many modern interpreters. It provides a meaningful parallel with Las Meninas, a masterpiece by an artist Manet admired, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. There has been a considerable development of this topic since Michel Foucault broached it in his book The Order of Things (1966).\r The art historian Jeffrey Meyers describes the intentional play on perspective and the apparent violation of the operations of mirrors: \u201cBehind her, and extending for the entire length of the four-and-a-quarter-foot painting, is the gold frame of an enormous mirror. The French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty has called a mirror \u2018the instrument of a universal magic that changes things into spectacles, spectacles into things, me into others, and others into me.\u2019 We, the viewers, stand opposite the barmaid on the other side of the counter and, looking at the reflection in the mirror, see exactly what she sees... A critic has noted that Manet\u2019s \u2018preliminary study shows her placed off to the right, whereas in the finished canvas she is very much the centre of attention.\u2019 Though Manet shifted her from the right to the center, he kept her reflection on the right. Seen in the mirror, she seems engaged with a customer; in full face, she\u2019s self-protectively withdrawn and remote.\u201d\r The painting is rich in details which provide clues to social class and milieu. The woman at the bar is a real person, known as Suzon, who worked at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re in the early 1880s. For his painting, Manet posed her in his studio. By including a dish of oranges in the foreground, Manet identifies the barmaid as a prostitute, according to art historian Larry L. Ligo, who says that Manet habitually associated oranges with prostitution in his paintings. T.J. Clark says that the barmaid is \"intended to represent one of the prostitutes for which the Folies-Berg\u00e8re was well-known\", who is represented \"as both a salesperson and a commodity\u2014something to be purchased along with a drink.\"\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Spring (Study of Jeanne Demarsy)\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: aquatint,canvas,etching,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/spring-study-of-jeanne-demarsy-1882\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSpring is a painting by \u00c9douard Manet that was created in 1881.

The painting also became the first work of art ever to be published in color.\r Spring was the first of a planned quartet of allegorical works using chic Parisian women to depict the four seasons. The idea came from Manet\u2019s friend, Antonin Proust, who suggested a series of seasons personified by contemporary ideals of women, fashion and beauty. The series was never finished and Manet died a year after finishing only the second of the series, Autumn.\r In November 2014, the J.

Despite three previous paintings and numerous still lifes, the painter had not received the critical acclaim which he expected. He finally reached it through Around the Piano. The painting, however, remains the least known of series of four ones, perhaps because the people depicted are less famous.\r Exhibited at the Salon of 1885, the painting was called The Wagnerists by visitors, as the person seated at the piano was thought to be Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, a composer who was an early supporter of Wagner.

Tissot moved to England in the year 1871, when he was thirty five years old and settled there. Before moving to London, Tissot was a successful painter of Paris society.\r It is 30 by 39 inches (76 by 99\u00a0cm) in size. The painting shows a group of elegantly dressed men and women during a picnic at the pond in the painter's garden. The painting is characterized by the attention to detail and vivid colours. Holyday is held in London's Tate Gallery.\r Holyday was painted in the back garden of Tissot's London home, near the Lord's Cricket Ground. Autumn is coming, the leaves of the large chestnut tree are changing color, but the rest of the vegetation is still green and luxurious. The low sun shines a bright afternoon light on the scene. On the right is the painter's wife, Kathleen Newton, who appears to avert her eyes from the scene. The men in the painting belong to the well-known I Zingari cricket club, judging by their yellow, red and black hats. The women are overdressed, one of Tissot's idiosyncrasies. The atmosphere is sensual and relaxed and demonstrates a British sense of superiority.\r Stylistically, Holyday is striking because of its crystal-clear representation. The work is hyperrealistic and greatly detailed, with sparkling colors. The focus on daily scenes comes from Impressionism, which was en vogue in the Paris of those days. The influence of Manet can be recognized, also in the choice of subject, reminiscent of his Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe (The Luncheon on the Grass). However, Holyday does not provoke but is suffused with a British conservatism.\r Tissot's Holyday was shown in 1877 in London's Grosvenor Gallery as a pendant for A Convalescent, which was also painted by Tissot in his yard. He made studies for both paintings in a single sketchbook. He probably intended the two to be a diptych, though they were quickly separated when sold and never exhibited together afterward. A Convalescent is in the Manchester Art Gallery; Holyday was acquired by the Tate Gallery in 1928.\n", "\nArtist: James Tissot\nArtwork Name: The Shop Girl\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/james-tissot/the-shop-girl-1885\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Shop Girl (La Demoiselle de Magasin) is a painting by James Tissot in the collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario. The painting depicts a young woman standing inside a shop selling ribbons and dresses. In one hand she holds a wrapped package of newly purchased items. With the other she holds open the door to the store for the viewer to depart. The shop is filled with piles of ribbons. Outside a busy Parisian street scene is visible through the shop windows. A well dressed man stares in through the window and is greeted by the other girl in the shop.\r The painting was created in the period 1883\u20131885 using Tissot's distinctive style of dry pigments and small brush strokes\u2014not impressionism, but still a major departure from the Academy style. It also reflects some of Tissot's main interests, such as the materialistic world of objects and clothing of the late nineteenth century. The painting also employs Tissot's favourite technique of this period of placing the observer directly in the painting, with the shop girl holding the door open for us. It was first exhibited in 1885 at the Galerie Sedelmeyer. It was a part of an exhibit Tissot titled Quinze tableau sur la femme \u00e0 Paris (fifteen paintings on the woman of Paris). It was his last major exhibition before Tissot embraced religious subjects and spent the rest of his life painting scenes from the Bible. The painting was purchased by the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1968.\r Regina Haggo sees this painting as a depiction of barely contained lust. On the floor a fallen ribbon makes a clear heart shape. To Haggo the position of the heart on the floor makes clear this is a baser form of desire. The women are modestly clothed, but Tissot emphasizes their figures, especially the breasts of the woman raising her arms. In this period a woman working outside the home was considered morally dubious. The leering man and the vantage of the viewer can suggest that more than just the clothing is for sale. The man outside may be flirting with the shop girl, but Haggo notes that Tissot emasculated him by having a women's torso overlap his own.\n", "\nArtist: James Tissot\nArtwork Name: Crucifixion, seen from the Cross\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: watercolor\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/james-tissot/crucifixion-seen-from-the-cross-1890\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Crucifixion, seen from the Cross is a c. 1890 watercolor painting by the French painter James Tissot.

It is a fine example of C\u00e9zanne's skilled, nuanced, and innovative mature work after 1880.\r C\u00e9zanne painted four oil portraits of this Italian boy in the red vest, all in different poses, which allowed him to study the relationship between the figure and space. The most famous of the four, and the one commonly referred to by this title, is the one which depicts the boy in a melancholic seated pose with his elbow on a table and his head cradled in his hand. It is currently held in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. The other three portraits, of different poses, are in museums in the US.\r The Foundation E.G. B\u00fchrle, which currently owns the work, notes the painting's picturesqueness, adding that \"There is a perfect balance here of high compositional intelligence and spontaneous painterly intuition.\" In 1895, art critic Gustave Geffroy said it could stand comparison with the finest figure paintings of the Old Masters.\r The colors of the painting are rich, dense, and festive. The composition is organized with three main diagonals: the angle of the boy's tilted back and head, the angle of the deep-green curtain behind the boy, and the long angle of the seat and table rising from the lower left. These three angles are countered by the angles of the boy's thighs and arms, creating a tightly articulated structure of intersecting diagonals.\r This painting was acquired from C\u00e9zanne by art dealer Ambroise Vollard, probably in 1895, and successively acquired by art collectors Marcell Nemes in 1909 and Gottlieb Reber in 1913. Art collector and patron Emil Georg B\u00fchrle purchased it from Beber in 1948. Following B\u00fchrle's death in 1956, his heirs donated the painting to the Foundation E.G. B\u00fchrle in 1960.\r In February 2008, the painting was stolen from the Foundation E.G. B\u00fchrle in Zurich. It was the museum's most valuable painting and was valued at $91 million. It was recovered in Serbia in April 2012.\n", "\nArtist: Paul Cezanne\nArtwork Name: Basket of Apples\nArtwork Genre: still life\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/still-life-with-bottle-and-apple-basket-1894\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Basket of Apples is a still life oil painting by French artist Paul C\u00e9zanne. It belongs to the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.\r The piece is often noted for its disjointed perspective. It has been described as a balanced composition due to its unbalanced parts; the tilted bottle, the incline of the basket, and the foreshortened lines of the cookies mesh with the lines of the tablecloth. Additionally, the right side of the tabletop is not in the same plane as the left side, as if the image simultaneously reflects two viewpoints.

It depicts four human skulls stacked in a pyramidal configuration. Painted in a pale light against a dark background, Pyramid of Skulls is exceptional in the artist's oeuvre, for \"in no other painting did C\u00e9zanne place his objects so close to the viewer.\" For art historian Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, \"these bony visages all but assault the viewer, displaying an assertiveness very much at odds with the usual reserve of domestic still-life tableaux.\"\r Working in isolation in the last decade of his life, C\u00e9zanne frequently alluded to mortality in his letters: \"For me, life has begun to be deathly monotonous\"; \"As for me, I'm old. I won't have time to express myself\"; and \"I might as well be dead.\" It is possible that the death of his mother on October 25, 1897\u2014she had been a protective and supportive influence\u2014accelerated his meditations on mortality, a subject which had obsessed the artist since the late 1870s, but did not find pictorial form for another twenty years. C\u00e9zanne's health started to deteriorate at the same time. The dramatic resignation to death informs a number of still life paintings he made between 1898 and 1905 of skulls. These works, some painted in oils and some with watercolor, are more subtle in meaning yet also more visually stark than the traditional approach to the theme of vanitas.\r C\u00e9zanne's interest in the subject may have had roots in thoughts other than the contemplation of death. He could have been drawn to the skulls' volumetric forms, just as he was to those of fruits and vases, and he supposedly exclaimed \"How beautiful a skull is to paint!\" They also share physical similarities with his self-portrayals: \"the skulls confront the viewer straight-on in a manner reminiscent of the artist's portraits.\" In both sets of works the mass of the cranium is emphasized: in the self-portraits the lower half of his face is obscured by his beard, while the skulls lack lower jaws altogether. In both series attention is focused on the round pate and eye sockets. There would have been further reason for the subject to interest C\u00e9zanne: skulls were prominent in the homes of Catholics, and C\u00e9zanne was a devout Catholic knowledgeable in ancient Christian texts. Human skulls had also long been common accessories in artists' studios. Indeed, the contents of C\u00e9zanne's studio were known to include \"three skulls, (and) an ivory Christ on an ebony cross\" near one another on the mantelpiece.\r Joachim Gasquet, a friend of the artist, later recalled:\r Pyramid of Skulls was painted at C\u00e9zanne's studio in Aix, where he worked prior to his move into the new Les Lauves studio in September 1902. A visitor to the studio in July 1902 wrote: \"In his bedroom, on a narrow table in the middle, I noticed three human skulls facing one another, three beautiful polished ivories. He spoke of a very good painted study that was somewhere in the attic. I wanted to see it.\" But C\u00e9zanne could not find the key to the garret, and blamed his maid for its misplacement.\n", "\nArtist: Paul Cezanne\nArtwork Name: Large Bathers\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/large-bathers-1906\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Bathers (French: Les Grandes Baigneuses) is an oil painting by French artist Paul C\u00e9zanne first exhibited in 1906. The painting is the largest of a series of \"Bather\" paintings by C\u00e9zanne; the others are in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, National Gallery, London, the Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia, and the Art Institute of Chicago. Occasionally referred to as the Big Bathers or Large Bathers to distinguish it from the smaller works, the painting is considered one of the masterpieces of modern art, and is often considered C\u00e9zanne's finest work.\r C\u00e9zanne worked on the painting for seven years, and it remained unfinished at the time of his death in 1906. The painting was purchased in 1937 for $110,000 with funds from a trust fund for the Philadelphia Museum of Art by their major benefactor Joseph E. Widener. It was previously owned by Leo Stein.\r With each version of the bathers, C\u00e9zanne moved away from the traditional presentation of paintings, intentionally creating works which would not appeal to the novice viewer. He did this in order to avoid fleeting fads and give a timeless quality to his work, and in so doing paved the way for future artists to disregard current trends and paint pieces which would appeal equally to all generations. The abstract nude females present in Large Bathers give the painting tension and density. It is exceptional among his work in symmetrical dimensions, with the adaptation of the nude forms to the triangular pattern of the trees and river. Using the same technique as employed in painting landscapes and still lifes, Large Bathers is reminiscent of the work of Titian and Peter Paul Rubens. Comparisons are also often made with the other famous group of nude women of the same period, Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.\r The purchase of the painting, while generally praised, was nevertheless questioned by The Philadelphia Record, which noted that 41,000 (or ten percent) of Philadelphia's residents were without bathtubs, and that the money could therefore have been better spent elsewhere. While C\u00e9zanne's drawing ability has always been criticized, a critic once said that he \"made the ineptly drawn Bathers a warm evocation of leisurely summer bliss.\" The painting was featured in the BBC Two series 100 Great Paintings.\n", "\nArtist: Odilon Redon\nArtwork Name: The Cyclops\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/odilon-redon/the-cyclops\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Cyclops is a painting by Odilon Redon depicting a myth starring an \"unlucky naiad Galatea, loved by Polyphemus, the most famous Cyclops.\" Like most Cyclops in mythology, Polyphemus was villainized as a wild creature that hunted its victims and then consumed them. This subject had been painted before by artists such as Moreau; however Redon has taken this myth and given Polyphemus a makeover. In Redon's version, Polyphemus is shown as a non-threatening passive creature. The normally menacing beast is shown softly gazing with a large eye that has been seen in previous Redon works. Galatea, the naiad, is shown naked and vulnerably lying on a patch of vegetation. It appears Polyphemus is keeping one gentle eye watching over the \"sexualized maiden.\" He has hidden himself from Galatea behind the rocky terrain, too shy to directly confront her \"helpless\" form. Redon's departure from the normal depiction of Polyphemus was influenced by his dream-like style and ambivalence toward the artistic norm.\r Redon, born in Bordeaux on April 20, 1840, worked his way into the art community. He had to take the entrance exam for art school more than once; his artwork was at first only known and popular in Symbolist circles. Redon was a contemporary of Monet and Renoir but never an adherent of Impressionism. Redon was viewed as an outsider and his art was not widely accepted during his life. The official Salon rejected his work and he rarely exhibited other than at La vie moderne in 1881 and at Le Gaulois in 1882. Drawing deeply from his imagination, Redon explains, \"My father often used to say to me: 'Look at those clouds, can you see as I can, the changing shapes in them?' And then he would show me strange beings, fantastic and marvelous visions, in the changing sky.\" So much of what Redon would create was conjured from his imagination. He described his style as follows: \"My originality consists in bringing to life, in a human way, improbable beings and making them live according to the laws and probability, by putting- as far as possible- the logic of the visible at the service of the invisible.\"\r This fabulous theme, similar to Hieronymus Bosch and the writer Edgar Allan Poe, was refreshing for the period and caught the eye of Andries Bonger. Bonger would become Redon's primary collector and over time his intimate friend. It was through this relationship that Redon gained his good standing in the art community.\r The Cyclops Polyphemus was not the first mythical creature to grace Redon's work. Centaurs, winged horses, satyrs, sirens and even human-headed spiders also frequent his paintings and drawings. In his work The Origins, a series of eight lithograph illustrations done in 1883, Redon depicts another Cyclops, known as No. 3 in the series. You can see a great similarity in style to the larger painting The Cyclops. The eyes of both creatures are large and would otherwise be menacing if it weren't for the sensitive nature in their rendering. No.3 goofily smiles while staring upward to the sky. Not much can be seen of his location but it appears to be outdoors. \"The mis-shapen polyp floated on the shores, a sort of smiling hideous Cyclops.\" The creature, usually meant to be repulsive and terrifying, does not manage to strike fear into the viewer's heart. Just like the other illustrations in the series, the Cyclops of the lithograph may retain his hideous face, but it is hidden under the same gentle quality portrayed in the painting The Cyclops. \"Redon's entire career consisted in finding ways to represent nature's surplus. His monsters unwittingly came to symbolize the staunchly idiosyncratic nature of his artistic trajectory: art, like the monster itself, would prove us wrong in our will to distinguish between human and nonhuman, ugly and beautiful.\"\n", "\nArtist: Claude Monet\nArtwork Name: Women in the garden\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet/women-in-the-garden\n\nWikipedia Article:\nWomen in the Garden (French: Femmes au jardin) is an oil painting begun in 1866 by French artist Claude Monet when he was 26. It is a large work painted en plein air; the size of the canvas necessitated Monet painting its upper half with the canvas lowered into a trench he had dug, so that he could maintain a single point of view for the entire work. The setting is the garden of a property he was renting. His companion Camille posed for the figures. Monet finished the work indoors, and used magazine illustrations to render fashionable clothing.\r Monet at this time was early in his career, experimenting with method and subject matter. His earlier paintings were successful at Paris Salons, but Women in the Garden was rejected in 1867 on the grounds of subject and narrative weakness. The Salon was also troubled by Monet's heavy brushstrokes, a style which would, of course, become one of the hallmarks of Impressionism. A judge commented, \"Too many young people think of nothing but continuing in this abominable direction. It is high time to protect them and save art!\" The painting was purchased by fellow artist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille to help support Monet at a time when he had no money.\r Although the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, the painting's owner, comments that \"Monet has skilfully rendered the white of the dresses, anchoring them firmly in the structure of the composition\", Christoph Heinrich, author of a Monet biography, notes how posterity has found the painting lacking. In this view, the figures appear poorly integrated into the scene, with the woman at right \"gliding across the ground as if she had a trolley concealed beneath her dress\". The painting's treatment of light and shadow is lauded, however, and in this respect the work may have shown Monet where his artistic path lay.\n", "\nArtist: Claude Monet\nArtwork Name: Garden at Sainte-Adresse\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet/garden-at-sainte-adresse\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Garden at Sainte-Adresse is a painting by the French impressionist painter, Claude Monet. (Oil on canvas, 98.1\u00a0cm x 129.9\u00a0cm). The painting was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art after an auction sale at Christie's in December 1967, under the French title La terrasse \u00e0 Sainte-Adresse. The painting was exhibited at the 4th Impressionist exhibition, Paris, April 10\u2013May 11, 1879, as no. 157 under the title Jardin \u00e0 Sainte-Adresse.\r Monet spent the summer of 1867 at the resort town of Sainte-Adresse on the English Channel, near Le Havre (France). It was there, in a garden with a view of Honfleur on the horizon, that he painted this picture, which combines smooth, traditionally rendered areas with sparkling passages of rapid, separate brushwork, and spots of pure colour.\r The models were probably Monet's father, Adolphe, in the foreground, Monet's cousin Jeanne Margu\u00e9rite Lecadre at the fence; Dr. Adolphe Lecadre, her father; and perhaps Lecadre's other daughter, Sophie, the woman seated with her back to the viewer.\r Although the scene projects affluent domesticity, it is by no means a family portrait. Monet's relations with his father were tense that summer, owing to family disapproval of the young artist's liaison with his companion, Camille Doncieux, his wife to be.\r Monet called this work in his correspondence \"the Chinese painting in which there are flags\"; his friend, Renoir referred to it as \"the Japanese painting\". In the 1860s, the composition's flat horizontal bands of colour would have reminded the sophisticated of Japanese colour wood-block prints, which were avidly collected by Monet, Manet, Renoir, Whistler and others in their circle. The print by the Japanese artist Hokusai that may have inspired this picture, \"Turban-shell Hall of the Five-Hundred-Rakan Temple\" (1830), remains today at Monet's house-museum at Giverny.\r The elevated vantage point and relatively even sizes of the horizontal areas emphasize the two-dimensionality of the painting. The three horizontal zones of the composition seem to rise parallel to the picture plane instead of receding into space. The subtle tension resulting from the combination of illusionism and the two-dimensionality of the surface remained an important characteristic of Monet's style.\r The painting is now in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was bought in 1967, with special contributions given or bequeathed by friends of the Museum.\n", "\nArtist: Claude Monet\nArtwork Name: Regatta at Sainte-Adresse\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet/regatta-at-sainte-adresse\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Regatta at Sainte-Adresse is an oil-on-canvas painting by the impressionist painter Claude Monet. It was painted in 1867 and is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\r This painting and The Beach in Sainte-Adresse (Art Institute of Chicago) were probably conceived as a pair. They are identical in size, and their viewing point differs by only a few yards.\r Sainte-Adresse, the well-to-do suburb of Le Havre, was the home of Monet's father. Destitute, Monet spent the summer of 1867 with his father and aunt Sophie Lecadre at the cost of abandoning his companion, Camille Doncieux, and their newborn son, Jean. Monet attended the birth in Paris and returned to the coast a few days later.\r The pair of paintings juxtaposes this sunny regatta watched at high tide by well dressed bourgeois, with an overcast scene at low tide, fishing boats hauled onto the beach peopled with sailors and workers. Since Monet never exhibited the paintings side by side, the contrast between them was probably not intended as a social manifesto but instead reflected differing conditions under which the same place could be painted.\r On 25 June 1867, Monet reported that he was working on about twenty pictures:\r The painting is signed at the lower left.\r ?Henri Hecht, Paris (1873; bought in January for Fr 500 from the artist);\u00a0?sale, H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, April 5, 1884, no. 25, as \"Sainte-Adresse\"; [Durand-Ruel, Paris, about 1888\u201391, sold on August 20, 1891 to Widener]; P.

Monet's patron, Louis Joachim Gaudibert, helped arrange a house in \u00c9tretat for Monet's girlfriend Camille Doncieux and their newborn son, allowing Monet to paint in relative comfort, surrounded by his family.\r Between 1867 and 1893, Monet and fellow Impressionists Alfred Sisley and Camille Pissarro painted hundreds of landscapes illustrating the natural effect of snow (effet de neige). Similar winter paintings were produced by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, and Paul Gauguin. Art historians believe that a series of severe winters in France contributed to an increase in the number of winter landscapes produced by Impressionists.\r The Magpie is one of approximately 140 snowscapes produced by Monet. His first snowscape, A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur, was painted sometime in either 1865 or 1867, followed by a notable series of snowscapes in the same year, beginning with the Road by Saint-Simeon Farm in Winter. The Magpie was completed in 1869 and is Monet's largest winter painting. It was followed by The Red Cape (1869\u20131871), the only known winter painting featuring Camille Doncieux.\r The canvas of The Magpie depicts a solitary black magpie perched on a gate formed in a wattle fence, as the light of the sun shines upon freshly fallen snow creating blue shadows. The painting features one of the first examples of Monet's use of colored shadows, which would later become associated with the Impressionist movement. Monet and the Impressionists used colored shadows to represent the actual, changing conditions of light and shadow as seen in nature, challenging the academic convention of painting shadows black. This subjective theory of color perception was introduced to the art world through the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul earlier in the century.\r At the time, Monet's innovative use of light and color led to its rejection by the Paris Salon of 1869. Today, art historians classify The Magpie as one of Monet's best snowscape paintings. The painting was privately held until the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay acquired it in 1984; it is considered one of the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.\r In the late 1850s, French landscape painter Eug\u00e8ne Boudin (1824\u20131898) introduced Monet (1840\u20131926) to the art of painting en plein air\u2014\"in the open air\", using natural light. The invention of the collapsible metal paint tube (1841) and portable easel brought painting, formerly confined to studios, into the outdoors. Boudin and Monet spent the summer of 1858 painting nature together. Like Boudin, Monet came to prefer painting outdoors rather than in a studio, the convention of the time. \"If I have become a painter,\" Monet said, \"I owe it to Boudin.\"\r The landscape paintings of Dutch painter Johan Barthold Jongkind (1819\u20131891) influenced both Boudin and Monet and contributed to the development of early Impressionism. After meeting Jongkind in Sainte-Adresse in 1862, Monet began to cultivate an interest in Jongkind's perspective on the changing conditions of the landscape. From Jongkind, Monet learned to substitute optical color for local color. \"Complementing the teaching I received from Boudin, Jongkind was from that moment my true master,\" Monet later reminisced. \"It was he who completed the education of my eye\". This new way of seeing, a shift from a conceptual to a perceptual approach, formed the basis for Monet's Haystacks (1890-1891), a series of 25 works showing the effects of dynamic atmospheric conditions over time on a single haystack motif.\n", "\nArtist: Claude Monet\nArtwork Name: The\u00a0Grenouill\u00e8re\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet/the-grenouill%C3%A8re\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBain \u00e0 la Grenouill\u00e8re is a painting by the impressionist painter, Claude Monet.

Pierre-Auguste Renoir, who has just spent two months here, also wants to do this painting.\" Monet and Renoir, both desperately poor, were quite close at the time.\r The painting here and one in the London National Gallery (Bathers at La Grenouillere, oil on canvas, 73 x 92\u00a0cm) are probably the sketches mentioned by Monet in his letter. A bigger size painting, now lost but formerly in the Arnhold collection in Berlin, may well have been the \"tableau\" that he dreamed of. The broad, constructive brushstrokes here are clearly those of a sketch. For his exhibition pictures Monet usually sought a more delicate and carefully calibrated surface at this time. An almost identical composition of the same subject by Renoir is in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm. The two friends were undoubtedly working side by side.\r La Grenouill\u00e8re was a popular middle-class resort consisting of a spa, a boating establishment and a floating caf\u00e9. Optimistically promoted as \"Trouville-sur-Seine\", it was located on the Seine near Bougival, easily accessible by train from Paris and had just been favoured with a visit by Emperor Napoleon III with his wife and son. Monet and Renoir both recognized in La Grenouill\u00e8re an ideal subject for the images of leisure they hoped to sell.\r As in his earlier picture of the Garden at Sainte-Adresse, Monet concentrated on repetitive elements \u2013 the ripples on the water, the foliage, the boats, the human figures \u2013 to weave a fabric of brushstrokes which, although emphatically brushstrokes, retain a strong descriptive quality.\r The painting is now in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Shown at what would later be known as the \"Exhibition of the Impressionists\" in April 1874, the painting is attributed to giving rise to the name of the Impressionist movement. Impression, Sunrise depicts the port of Le Havre, Monet's hometown, and is his most famous painting of the harbor.\r Impression, Sunrise is displayed at the Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet in Paris.\r Monet visited his hometown of Le Havre in the Northwest of France in 1872 and proceeded to create a series of works depicting the port of Le Havre. The six painted canvases depict the port \"during dawn, day, dusk, and dark and from varying viewpoints, some from the water itself and others from a hotel room looking down over the port\".\r Impression, Sunrise became the most famous in the series after being debuted in April 1874 in Paris at an exhibition by the group \"Painters, Sculptors, Engravers etc. Inc.\" Among thirty participants, the exhibition was led by Monet, Edgar Degas, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley, and showed over two hundred works that were seen by about 4,000 people, including some rather unsympathetic critics.\r In 1985 the painting was stolen from the Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet by Philippe Jamin and Youssef Khimoun. It was recovered and returned to the museum in 1990,, and put back on display in 1991.\r Monet claimed that he titled the painting Impression, Sunrise due to his hazy painting style in his depiction of the subject: \"They asked me for a title for the catalogue, it couldn't really be taken for a view of Le Havre, and I said: 'Put Impression.'\" In addition to this explanation for the title of the work, art historian Paul Smith claims that Monet might have named the painting Impression to excuse his painting from accusations of being unfinished or lacking descriptive detail, but Monet received these criticisms regardless of the title.\r While the title of the painting seemed to be chosen in haste for the catalogue, the term \"Impressionism\" was not new. It had been used for some time to describe the effect of paintings from the Barbizon school. Both associated with the school, Daubigny and Manet had been known to use the term to describe their own works.\r In critic Louis Leroy's review of the 1874 exhibition, \"The Exhibition of the Impressionists\" for the newspaper Le Charivari, he used \"Impressionism\" to describe the new style of work displayed, which he said was typified by Monet\u2019s painting of the same name.\r Before the 1860s and the debut of Impression, Sunrise, the term \"impressionism\" was originally used to describe the effect of a natural scene on a painter, and the effect of a painting on the viewer. By the 1860s, \"impression\" was used by transference to describe a painting which relayed such an effect. In turn, impression came to describe the movement as a whole.\r Initially used to describe and deprecate a movement, the term Impressionism \"was immediately taken up by all parties\" to describe the style, and Monet\u2019s Impression, Sunrise considered to encapsulate the start of the movement and its name.\n", "\nArtist: Claude Monet\nArtwork Name: Boulevard of Capucines\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet/boulevard-of-capucines-1874\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBoulevard des Capucines is an oil on canvas street scene painting of Boulevard des Capucines by French Impressionist artist Claude Monet created in 1873.\r From the late 1860s, Monet and other like-minded artists, met with rejection from the conservative Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts which held its annual exhibition at the Salon de Paris. During the latter part of 1873, Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, and Sisley organized the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme des artistes peintres, sculpteurs et graveurs to exhibit their artworks independently. At their first exhibition, held in April 1874, Monet exhibited the work that was to give the group its lasting name, Impression, Sunrise. Among the works Monet included in the first Impressionist exhibition was The Luncheon, 1868, which features Camille Doncieux and Jean Monet. The painting was rejected by the Paris Salon of 1870.\r Also in this exhibition was a painting titled Boulevard des Capucines, a painting of the boulevard done from the photographer Nadar's apartment at no. 35. Monet painted the subject twice and it is uncertain which of the two pictures, that now in the Pushkin Museum in Moscow, or that in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City (shown here) was the painting that appeared in the groundbreaking 1874 exhibition, though more recently the Moscow picture has been favoured.\n", "\nArtist: Claude Monet\nArtwork Name: Snow Scene at Argenteuil\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet/snow-scene-at-argenteuil\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSnow at Argenteuil (French: Rue sous la neige, Argenteuil) is an oil-on-canvas landscape painting from the Impressionist artist Claude Monet. It is the largest of no fewer than eighteen works Monet painted of his home commune of Argenteuil while it was under a blanket of snow during the winter of 1874\u20131875. This painting\u2014number\u00a0352 in Wildenstein\u2019s catalogue of the works of Monet\u2014is the largest of the eighteen. The attention to detail evident in the smaller paintings is less evident in this larger picture. Instead, Monet has rendered large areas of the canvas in closely like tones and colours of blue and grey. The application of smaller strokes of greens, yellows, reds and darker blues breaks up these large expanses, and the almost choreographed dispersal of these various colours helps bind the picture together. Paint at the depicted road surface is thicker than elsewhere in the painting, and impasto is suggestive of the feel of disturbed snow.\r Most of Monet\u2019s Snow at Argenteuil pictures from the winter of 1874\u20131875 were painted from locations close to the house on the boulevard\u00a0Saint-Denis (now number 21\u00a0boulevard\u00a0Karl Marx) into which Monet and his family had just moved. This particular painting shows the boulevard Saint-Denis looking in the direction of the junction with the rue\u00a0de\u00a0la\u00a0Voie-des-Bans, with the river Seine out of sight to the rear, and the local railway station behind Monet\u2019s back as he painted.\r In December 1879 the painting was acquired from Monet by Th\u00e9odore Duret.

The cliff that can be seen is that of \u00c9tretat (Seine Maritime), as Monet stayed in the city many times from the winter 1864-1865, and wrote: \"I spend my time outdoors on the stone when it's big time [...] and of course I work all the time.\" Monet composed the painting in February 1883 from the window of the hotel he lived then. Subsequently, the painting was bought by the Parisian dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, then became the property of the Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon in 1902. The museum thus became a precursor gaining early in the twentieth century Impressionist paintings.\r The painting is composed of four major elements, each painted in a different way. The central part is invaded by the pearlized surfs painted in forms of commas.

Monet painted this subject as part of a series of views of the monastery-island of San Giorgio Maggiore. These were begun in 1908 when the 68-year-old artist made his only visit to Venice.\r One version of San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk was acquired in Paris by the Welsh art collector Gwendoline Davies. She bequeathed it to the Art Gallery (now National Museum Cardiff) in Cardiff, Wales. The painting is normally on display there.\r There is a version in the Bridgestone Museum of Art.\r San Giorgio Maggiore al Crepuscolo is approximately two-by-three feet and painted in oil on canvas. It depicts mysterious buildings that seem to magically appear from the surrounding landscape, they almost seem to float in the background. The forms are gently inserted, though not enough to disguise their identity. The painting focuses on the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore with its bell tower rising to the top of the painting. To the right are the faintly visible domes of Santa Maria della Salute and the mouth of the Grand Canal.\r Monet painted the church of San Giorgio Maggiore in six lighting conditions. With this varied approach, the paintings focused on the \u2018nature of experience.\u2019 He was particularly impressed by the Venetian sunsets, \u201cthese splendid sunsets which are unique in the world.\u201d He had previously been inspired by other sunsets, such as those of Normandy (in Rouen Cathedral and Haystacks, his series of the 1890s) and London (Houses of Parliament).\r Monet and his wife Alice stayed at the Palazzo Barbaro for a couple of weeks, and then moved to the Hotel Britannia, where they stayed until December. According to Mme. Monet, the Britannia had a view, \"if such a thing were possible, even more beautiful than that of Palazzo Barbaro...\" Monet painted looking out from this hotel, but not, it seems, in the case of this particular painting. Although the view from the hotel included the church of San Giorgio Maggiore, the painting appears to have been viewed from the waterfront known as the Riva degli Schiavoni, where the island forms a focal point of the view.\r Monet was reportedly reluctant to paint from the waterfront out of fear of conforming to other artists who were drawn to Venice, such as Renoir or Manet. San Giorgio Maggiore was a favorite subject for painters, including the proto-Impressionist Turner.\r Monet felt Venice was a city \"too beautiful to be painted\", which may be why he returned with many paintings unfinished to Giverny, his home in France. However, he had already retreated from his earlier practice of painting from life, in front of the subject. He worked on the Venetian scenes at home and the death of his wife Alice in 1911 seems to have been a factor in their completion. In 1912 he held a successful exhibition Claude Monet Venise at the gallery Bernheim-Jeune in Paris.\n", "\nArtist: Claude Monet\nArtwork Name: The Grand Canal 03\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet/the-grand-canal-03\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLe Grand Canal is an oil on canvas painting by French Impressionist painter Claude Monet (1840 - 1926). This painting is part of a series of paintings Monet undertook during 1908. This painting series en plein air, is a classic view of the Grand Canal, an attempt to capture the ever-changing face of Venice, as seen from the Palazzo Barbaro, where he stayed during his trip, was painted during a period that is generally regarded by art historians as the peak of his career. One of the paintings from this series of Venetian waterscapes by Claude Monet was sold for more than $35 million at 2015 Sotheby's auction. Sotheby's called this painting \"one of the most celebrated Venice paintings\". Previously it has been in the private collection of the New Orleans sugar magnate, Hunt Henderson, who was a noted art collector.\r This painting was undertaken on Monet's trip to Venice in the autumn of the year 1908, when the artist responded to an invitation from the American woman Mary Young Hunter, to visit her at the Palazzo Barbaro, in Venice. Monet was 68 years old this year. Hunter was a friend of Monet's wife, Alice, who invited the couple to come to visit her in Venice, where she rented this palazzo. Initially Monet was not keen but he did decide to travel. Monet and his wife arrived in Italy on October 1.\r While there Monet completed a series of artwork on the Canale Grande painting the same motif at different times of the day. Monet had the habit of studying the same subject in a varying light, at different times of the day, which resulted during his active career in many distinct Monet series, like for example the Water Lilies series, Poplar series, Rouen Cathedral series, Haystacks series and Charing Cross Bridge series. Monet painted 37 works of Venice during his three-month stay in Italy, from October to December, including this painting and five more depicting the same theme, Canale Grande. One is hosted at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.\r This painting depicts the view, from the Palazzo Barbaro. Monet\u2019s series introduced a fresh approach of a theme that was painted by many notable artist before him. The series are a pictorial exploration of the light upon the ancient city. The painter captured the sensations according to how the appearance of the motif changed as the light shifted on the water and its surroundings. The painter used the mooring-poles to counterbalance the buildings of the background including the Baroque church of Santa Maria della Salute. Monet was more preoccupied with capturing the light on the water and the sun rays reflections in this painting than the well known panoramas and sites or buildings in Venice, even if he stated that the city was very beautiful.\n", "\nArtist: Berthe Morisot\nArtwork Name: Summer's Day\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/berthe-morisot/summer-s-day-1879\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSummer's Day is a painting by French Impressionist painter Berthe Morisot.

Originally part of a now dismantled altarpiece known as Peter's Altar Table, the panel depicts the miraculous catch of 153 fish as reported in the Gospel of John and shows a scene of the disciples, who had been fishing at the edge of a lake, recognising the stranger who had called out to them from the shore as the resurrected Jesus. Peter is shown wading toward Jesus to greet him. In this painting Witz takes the revolutionary step of moving the scene from the biblical Sea of Galilee to his local area, around Lake Geneva. With this move, Witz was able to base his rendering of the far landscape on his own observation of actual topographical features rather than rely on imaginative interpretation as earlier artists did. He further brought the landscape to the fore of his work; here the range is not simply a footnote seen through a window or detail visible beyond a crucifixion scene. The painting is renowned for its naturalistic representation of the Graian Alps and the snow-capped peaks of Mont Blanc and Le M\u00f4le seen in the distance. In this regard the work is the earliest known faithful portrayal of a landscape in European art history.\r Detailed landscapes had already been portrayed by Early Netherlandist painters such as Jan van Eyck, and their characteristic attention to surface textures and rendering the depth of the receding landscape held strong influence over Witz. However these earlier works were neither based on actual geographical areas, or the careful observation evident in this work. In its innovation, the panel is analogous to Hans Bornemann, at the time working in L\u00fcneburg, who also adapted and greatly advanced the Netherlandish method when he began to paint, for the first time, cityscapes that gave a true account of all of the visible features, and not just the most important buildings.\r The painting can be seen as close study of the optics of reflection and the manner in which the form and appearance of objects is distorted reflected on water's surface. The buildings and rocks to the right are reflected, as are the coloured clothes of the men hauling a net in the small boat. In the foreground the water is so transparent the bed of the lake can be seen, while at the far end of the lake the tone of the water surface dissolves into a silvery expanse. Only the figure of Christ standing at the edge of the shore does not cast a reflection, the implication being that the laws of nature do not apply to the divine.\n", "\nArtist: Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald\nArtwork Name: The Mocking of Christ\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/matthias-grunewald/the-mocking-of-christ-1503\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Mocking of Christ (German: Die Verspottung Christi) is an early oil on wood painting (1503\u20131505) by Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald.

It is on display at the Unterlinden Museum at Colmar, Alsace, in France. The museum celebrated the 500th anniversary of the work in 2012. It is Gr\u00fcnewald's largest work, and is regarded as his masterpiece. It was painted for the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim near Colmar, which specialized in hospital work. The Antonine monks of the monastery were noted for their care of plague sufferers as well as their treatment of skin diseases, such as ergotism. The image of the crucified Christ is pitted with plague-type sores, showing patients that Jesus understood and shared their afflictions.\r The altarpiece has two sets of wings, displaying three configurations:\r Wings closed:\r With the exception of certain holy days, the wings of the altarpiece were kept closed, displaying The Crucifixion framed on the left by the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian pierced by arrows, and on the right by Saint Anthony the Great, remaining placid although he is being taunted by a frightening monster. The two saints protect and heal the sick, Saint Anthony as the patron saint of the victims of Saint Anthony's fire and Saint Sebastian, whose aid was invoked to ward off the plague. Gr\u00fcnewald's Crucifixion stands as one of the most poignant representations of this scene in Western art due to the artist's masterful depiction of horrific agony, with Christ's emaciated body writhing under the pain of the nails driven through his hands and feet. This body covered with sores and riddled with thorns must have terrified the sick, but also left no doubt about Christ's suffering, thus comforting them in their communion with the Saviour, whose pain they shared. \"Gr\u00fcnewald depicts Jesus' body ravaged by crucifixion yet evokes pointedly the Christian message of Jesus' horrible suffering; originally intended for a hospital, the altar painting may have been designed to provide comfort and solace to the sick.\" Mary, the mother of Jesus, is shown at Christ's right, collapsing in anguish in the arms of John, the beloved disciple of Christ, and shrouded in a large piece of white cloth.\r At Christ's left, John the Baptist is accompanied by a lamb, symbolising the sacrifice of Jesus. The presence of John the Baptist is anachronistic. Beheaded by order of Herod in 29 AD, he could not possibly have witnessed the death of Christ. This last figure announces the New Testament by crying out in Latin, illum oportet crescere me autem minui (Vulgate, John 3:30), \"He must increase, but I must decrease.\" The inclusion of John the Baptist in this scene is symbolic, since he is considered as the last of the prophets to announce the coming of the Messiah.\r Outer wings opened:\r The outer wings of the Isenheim Altarpiece were opened for important festivals of the liturgical year, particularly those in honour of the Virgin Mary. Thus are revealed four scenes: the left wing represents the Annunciation during which the archangel Gabriel comes to announce to Mary that she will give birth to Jesus, the son of God. The Virgin Mary is depicted in a chapel to indicate the sacred character of the event. In the central corpus, the Concert of Angels and the Nativity are not independent scenes but instead fit within a unified concept: the viewer witnesses Christ's coming to earth as a newborn baby, who will be led to combat the forces of evil personified by certain of the angels, disturbing in their physical appearance. A number of symbols provide keys to aid in interpretation: the enclosed garden represents Mary's womb and is a sign of her perpetual virginity, the rose bush without thorns refers to her as free of original sin, the fig tree symbolises mother's milk. The bed, the bucket and the chamber pot underscore the human nature of Christ. Lastly, the right wing shows the Resurrection, in which Christ emerges from the tomb and ascends into Heaven bathed in light transfiguring the countenance of the Crucified into the face of God. The Resurrection and the Ascension are therefore encapsulated in a single image.\n", "\nArtist: Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald\nArtwork Name: The Stuppach Madonna\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/matthias-grunewald/the-stuppach-madonna-1519\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Stuppach Madonna (German: Stuppacher Madonna) is a 1514\u20131519 painting of the Madonna and Child by the German Renaissance painter Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald.

They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451\u20131514) and Albrecht D\u00fcrer the Elder (c. 1427\u20131502), when she was around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of the physical and emotional effects of ageing. The D\u00fcrer family was close and D\u00fcrer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter.\r They were created either as pendants, that is conceived as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation may have been a later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of D\u00fcrer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings D\u00fcrer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident.\r Each panel measured 47.5\u00a0cm\u00a0x 39.5\u00a0cm (18.7\u00a0in\u00a0x 15.6\u00a0in), but the left hand panel has been cut down. They have been separated since at least 1628, until Barbara's portrait\u2014long considered lost\u2014was reattributed in 1977. The panels were reunited in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum's 2012 exhibition \"The Early D\u00fcrer\".\r The three-quarter view was widely used in southern German portraiture of the late-15th century. Rosary beads were often included to indicate the piousness and modesty of the sitters, although by the 16th century religious motifs and sentiments like this were falling out of fashion. D\u00fcrer distinguishes himself from his contemporaries through his tight and detailed focus on his parents' faces, a technique that draws comparison to the work of the first generation of Early Netherlandish painters active 50 years earlier. Albrecht the Elder had travelled to Flanders and from working with Netherlandish artists had acquired a strong appreciation for the work of both Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden. That he passed on this influence to his son is evident from the early use of silverpoint, a medium which according to Erwin Panofsky requires \"an exceptional degree of confidence, accuracy and sensitive feeling for its successful handling\".\r D\u00fcrer would have been aware of Hans Pleydenwurff's portrait of the ageing Count Georg von Lowenstein, through his teacher Michael Wolgemut. Pleydenwurff's portrait was in turn likely influenced by van Eyck's 1438 Portrait of Cardinal Niccol\u00f2 Albergati. Von Fircks believes the portrait of D\u00fcrer's father took from Pleydenwurff's portrait, which she describes as a \"highly detailed representation of [a] white haired old man, who defies the pains of growing old with an alert mind and an inner animation\".\r Von Fircks notes that D\u00fcrer's 1484 self-portrait was created with the use of a mirror while his most iconic work is a self-portrait; the 1500 Self-Portrait at Twenty-Eight. From these she concludes that the \"accurate observation and documentary recording\" of both his own and his parents' appearances over time was not just a compulsion, but that is indicative of a deeper interest in the effects of time and age on human appearance. Although D\u00fcrer was fascinated by the effects of ageing on others, he seems to have had some hesitancy at examining how it might affect him personally. The self-portraits tend to be idealised and the 1500 portrait was his last. Later self-portraits are far more understated and executed in a 'secondary' media, such as his drawings of the Man of Sorrows and nude drawing of 1505, which depicted an emaciated body during the time of the plague.\n", "\nArtist: Albrecht Durer\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Elector Frederick the Wise of Saxony\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/portrait-of-elector-frederick-the-wise-of-saxony-1496\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Frederick III of Saxony is a tempera on canvas painting by German Renaissance artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer, executed in 1496.

The lion was almost surely drawn from St. Mark's Lion depictions in the city.\r The painting was previously in the Fitzwilliam Museum of Cambridge, and was later bought by the London museum.\r St. Jerome was a common subject of art at the time. D\u00fcrer for this works was probably inspired by similar depictions by Giovanni Bellini, or other artists influenced by Andrea Mantegna.\r Jerome is portrayed during his hermitage, surrounded by all the symbols traditionally attributed to him: the tamed lion, the hat and the cardinal garments on the ground (a symbol of rejection of earthly honors), the book (Jerome was a translator of the Vulgate), the stone he used to hit himself, and the crucifix for the prayers.\r The depiction of nature is typical of Northern European art, with numerous details such as the small birds, the white butterfly in the lower part, as well as the fine rendering of the trunk's bark or the depiction of grass spear by spear. The sky in the background is similar to D\u00fcrer's watercolor of the Pool in the Wood, now in the British Museum.\r On the reverse of this painting is an intriguing image of what appears to be a meteor/meteorite or comet. D\u00fcrer's inspiration may have been the depictions of comets in the Nuremberg Chronicle of 1493. However, those woodcuts are highly stylized, and are not intended to show historical comets, whereas D\u00fcrer's image has the feel of an actual observation, as does the blazing star in D\u00fcrer's enigmatic engraving Melencolia I, published in 1514.\r If D\u00fcrer's images do represent actual celestial objects, then there are three possible candidates. The first is the Comet of 1491. Dr Sten Odenwald said that it \"allegedly came to within 0.0094 AU on 1491 Feb. 20.0 TT, but the orbit of this comet is very uncertain\"; NASA's website agrees with Odenwald's comment on the orbit. The second is the Ensisheim meteorite. This was suggested by Ursula B Marvin ('The meteorite of Ensisheim \u2013 1492 to 1992',(1992)), in relation to Melencolia I. This object fell in Alsace on 7 November 1492.

The child holds a fruit, a symbol of the Original Sin; the red padding of the cushion, as well as the tassels, perhaps symbolize the blood of the Jesus' Passion.\r The reverse of the painting is also painted, showing a Biblical scene of Lot's flight from Sodom, with a landscape including a firing town in the background. Since the two scenes are unrelated, it has been supposed that the panel was originally part of a diptych showing also the donor, with Lot and his children in the left panel.\n", "\nArtist: Albrecht Durer\nArtwork Name: Self-Portrait\nArtwork Genre: self-portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/self-portrait-1498\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSelf-portrait (or Self-portrait at 26) is the second of Albrecht D\u00fcrer's three painted self-portraits. In this work, executed in oil on wood panel in 1498, D\u00fcrer haughtily elevates himself to the social position he believed suited to an artist of his ability. D\u00fcrer depicts himself indoors under an arch, in half length, turning towards the viewer. Painted after his first trip to Italy, he is depicted bearing an arrogant, cocky expression which betrays the assured self-confidence of a young artist at the height of his ability. D\u00fcrer's presence dominates the pictorial space, from his hat which almost reaches the top of the canvas to his arm positioned on the lower ledge, where he rests his fingers enclosed in fine rich gloves.\r Until some time in the 19th century the painting was hung with and kept as a companion piece with Portrait of D\u00fcrer's Father at 70; in 1636 the two paintings were gifted as a pair to Charles I of England by the city of Nuremberg, and this work was at some point acquired by Philip IV of Spain. Today it is in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.\r D\u00fcrer shows himself before an open window with a flat plane with a lake before distant snow-capped mountains, the landscape perhaps representing either the memory of his recent travels abroad or his inner mental state. Light spills from the window, falling along his head to highlight both his delicate skin tones and long blond hair. D\u00fcrer is dressed with effeminate grace in flamboyant, extravagant clothes showing the influence of Italian fashion. His low-necked shirt or chemise is of fine linen, gathered and trimmed with a band of gold braid or embroidery, and worn under an open-fronted doublet and a cloak tied over one shoulder. His white jacket has black lining under a white pleated shirt of which the verticals match the horizontals of his headdress. His fingers are crossed, hidden inside silk gloves, an unusual pose for D\u00fcrer's early career; he always paid close attention in detailing the hands of his sitters who are usually showing holding an object; examples include a pillow, rosary, sheet of paper and flower.\r D\u00fcrer presents himself as almost seductive, with a rakish patterned hat placed over long, almost girlishly curled blond locks of hair under a draped pointed hat with a tassel. He looks out at the viewer with a cool ironic stare.\r Art historian Marcel Brion believes the self-portrait marks a farewell to his irresponsible youth, the acclaim he received during his visit to Italy and his general apprehension as the 15th century came to an end and dark clouds hung over the Germanic states. The middleground of the pleasing flat plain and lake may represent his travels from 1492 to 1497, yet they are shadowed by steep mountainous glaciers; forebodings of what lay in store. In this Brion interprets the artist's state as looking toward his future and past. D\u00fcrer's youthful character was enthusiastic, adventurous and inhibited, and after he left his hometown of Nuremberg in 1490 to travel as journeyman painter he was able to live his early youth with abandon and almost without consequence. By the time this portrait was painted he was back home, and old enough to begin to accept responsibilities.\n", "\nArtist: Albrecht Durer\nArtwork Name: Self-Portrait at the Age of Twenty Eight\nArtwork Genre: self-portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/self-portrait-at-the-age-of-twenty-eight-1500\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSelf-Portrait (or Self-Portrait at Twenty-Eight) is a panel painting by the German Renaissance artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Painted early in 1500, just before his 29th birthday, it is the last of his three painted self-portraits. Art historians consider it the most personal, iconic and complex of his self-portraits.  The self-portrait is most remarkable because of its resemblance to many earlier representations of Christ. Art historians note the similarities with the conventions of religious painting, including its symmetry, dark tones and the manner in which the artist directly confronts the viewer and raises his hands to the middle of his chest as if in the act of blessing.  D\u00fcrer's face has the inflexibility and impersonal dignity of a mask, hiding the restless turmoil of anguish and passion within. In its directness and apparent confrontation with the viewer, the self-portrait is unlike any that came before. It is half-length, frontal and highly symmetrical; its lack of a conventional background seemingly presents D\u00fcrer without regard to time or place. The placement of the inscriptions in the dark fields on either side of D\u00fcrer are presented as if floating in space, emphasizing that the portrait has a highly symbolic meaning. Its sombre mood is achieved through the use of brown tones set against the plain black background. The lightness of touch and tone seen in his earlier two self-portraits has been replaced by a far more introverted and complex representation.  In 1500, a frontal pose was exceptional for a secular portrait. In Italy the conventional fashion for profile portraits was coming to an end, but being replaced with the three-quarters view which had been the accepted pose in Northern Europe since about 1420, and which D\u00fcrer used in his earlier self-portraits.  Fully frontal poses remained unusual, although Hans Holbein painted several of Henry VIII of England and his queens, perhaps under instruction to use the pose.  Late medieval and Early Renaissance art had developed the more difficult three-quarters view, and artists were proud of their skill in using it; to viewers in 1500 and after, a frontal pose was associated with images from medieval religious art, and above all images of Christ.  The self-portrait is of a markedly more mature D\u00fcrer than both the 1493 Strasbourg self-portrait and the 1498 self-portrait which he produced after his first visit to Italy; in both of these earlier paintings he had highlighted his fashionable hairstyle and clothing and played on his youthful good looks. D\u00fcrer turned 28 around 1500, the time of this work. In the medieval view of the stages of life, 28 marked the transition from youth to maturity. The portrait therefore commemorates a turning point in the artist's life and in the millennium: the year 1500, displayed in the centre of the upper left background field, is here celebrated as epochal. Moreover, the placing of the year 1500 above his signature initials, A.D., gives them an added meaning as an abbreviation of Anno Domini. The painting may have been created as part of a celebration of the saeculum by the circle of the Renaissance humanist scholar Conrad Celtes, which included D\u00fcrer.\n", "\nArtist: Albrecht Durer\nArtwork Name: The Seven Sorrows\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/the-seven-sorrows\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Seven Sorrows Polyptych is an oil on panel painting by Albrecht D\u00fcrer. The painting includes a central picture (108 x 43\u00a0cm), currently at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, and seven surrounding panels (measuring some 60 x 46\u00a0cm) which are exhibited at the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister of Dresden.  The work was commissioned by Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, not a long time after his meeting with D\u00fcrer at Nuremberg in April 1496. Stylistic considerations suggest that the artist started to work on the painting only from around 1500.  Modern scholars tend to attribute to  D\u00fcrer only the central panel, the others having been executed by his pupils based on his drawings. The central panel, portraying the Sorrowing Mother, arrived in the Bavarian museum from the   Benediktbeuren convent of Munich in the early 19th century. It was restored in the 1930s: once the overpaintings and additions were removed, the shell-shaped niche (a motif typical of Italian art), the halo and the sword (a symbol of Mary of the Seven Sorrows) on the right were rediscovered, clarifying the subject of the work.  The other panels were at Wittenberg, seat of Frederick's castle. In 1640 they were moved to the  Kunstkammer of the Prince of Saxony. In the mid-20th century they were restored: their conditions improved, but the attribution was not cleared.\n", "\nArtist: Albrecht Durer\nArtwork Name: Young Hare\nArtwork Genre: animal painting\nArtwork Media: paper,watercolor\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/a-young-hare\n\nWikipedia Article:\nYoung Hare (German: Feldhase) is a 1502 watercolour and bodycolour painting by German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Painted in 1502 in his workshop; it is acknowledged as a masterpiece of observational art alongside his Great Piece of Turf from the following year. The subject is rendered with almost photographic accuracy, and although the piece is normally given the title Young Hare, the portrait is sufficiently detailed for the hare to be identified as a mature specimen \u2014 the German title translates as \"Field Hare\" and the work is often referred to in English as the Hare or Wild Hare.\r The subject was particularly challenging: the hare's fur lay in different directions and the animal was mottled with lighter and darker patches all over, D\u00fcrer had to adapt the standard conventions of shading to indicate the outline of the subject by the fall of light across the figure. Despite the technical challenges presented in rendering the appearance of light with a multi-coloured, multi-textured subject, D\u00fcrer not only managed to create a detailed, almost scientific, study of the animal but also infuses the picture with a warm golden light that hits the hare from the left, highlighting the ears and the run of hair along the body, giving a spark of life to the eye, and casting a strange shadow to the right.\r D\u00fcrer lightly sketched the image and underpainted it with some washes of brown watercolour. Then he patiently built up the texture of the fur with a variety of dark and light brushstrokes in both watercolour and bodycolour. Gradually, the painting was brought to completion with the addition of a few refined details such as the whiskers and the meticulous reflection of a window in the creature's eye.\r There is some debate over how D\u00fcrer accurately captured the image of the hare: he may have sketched a hare in the wild and filled in the individual details from a dead animal, or captured one and held it alive in his studio while he worked on the painting. A reflection of the window frame in the hare's eye is often cited as evidence for the theory that D\u00fcrer copied the hare from life in his workshop, but this cross-barred reflection is a technique that D\u00fcrer frequently used to add vitality to the eyes of his subjects.\r D\u00fcrer used his watercolour and bodycolour studies as source material for his prints, but in The Holy Family with Three Hares the hares are modestly rendered, and in the only of his other prints to feature a hare, the 1504 copperplate engraving Adam and Eve, the hare is turning away, half-hidden behind the legs of Eve. The prominent date and D\u00fcrer monogram on the Young Hare indicate that D\u00fcrer considered it a work in its own right rather than merely a preparatory sketch. The painting engendered numerous copies: at least twelve from contemporaries are known.\n", "\nArtist: Albrecht Durer\nArtwork Name: Great Piece of Turf\nArtwork Genre: flower painting,still life\nArtwork Media: watercolor\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/great-piece-of-turf-study-of-weeds-1503\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Great Piece of Turf (German: Das gro\u00dfe Rasenst\u00fcck) is a watercolor painting by Albrecht D\u00fcrer. The painting was created at D\u00fcrer's workshop in Nuremberg in 1503. It is a study of a seemingly unordered group of wild plants, including dandelion and greater plantain. The work is considered one of the masterpieces of D\u00fcrer's realistic nature studies.  In 1495  D\u00fcrer  returned from his Wanderjahre in Italy and settled in Nuremberg, where he opened a workshop. D\u00fcrer was only twenty-four years old at the time, but his workshop soon gained a great reputation for the high quality of his work. In 1500 he produced what is perhaps his most famous work, his Christ-like Self-Portrait. At the same time he was also creating smaller-scale works that were more focused on the study of nature, such as the Great Piece of Turf, which he painted in 1503, and the Young Hare from the year before.  The watercolour shows a large piece of turf and little else. The various plants can be identified as cock's-foot, creeping bent, smooth meadow-grass, daisy, dandelion, germander speedwell, greater plantain, hound's-tongue and yarrow.  The painting shows a great level of realism in its portrayal of natural objects. Some of the roots have been stripped of earth to be displayed clearly to the spectator. The depiction of roots is something that can also be found in other of D\u00fcrer's works, such as Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513). The vegetation comes to an end on the right side of the panel, while on the left it seems to continue on indefinitely. The background is left blank, and on the right can even be seen a clear line where the vegetation ends.  The humanist scholar Conrad Celtes compared D\u00fcrer's work to the literary work of the medieval philosopher and scientist Albertus Magnus. Like Magnus, D\u00fcrer based his work on the observation of nature. Along with the Wild Hare, the Great Piece of Turf had been called one of the masterpieces of this part of D\u00fcrer's work.  The composition shows little order and arrangement, the various roots, stems and flowers seem to be in opposition to each other. The apparent chaos, combined with the attentive detail of each individual plant, lends the painting greater realism. Though the composition of vegetation in itself is continuous and seemingly disorganised, the blank background provides a contrast to the chaos, and imposes a sense of order.  Though this work has been highly valued by later art historians, a realistic representation of nature was not a goal in itself for D\u00fcrer, but simply a tool for better conveying the sacred messages of his greater works. The Great Piece of Turf was primarily a study that would help him in the development of his art. The results can be seen both in his paintings, and in his highly detailed engravings, such as Adam and Eve from 1504.\n", "\nArtist: Albrecht Durer\nArtwork Name: Lamentation for Christ\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/lamentation-for-christ-1503\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLamentation of Christ (also known as Glimm Lamentation) is an oil-on-panel painting of the common subject of the Lamentation of Christ by the German Renaissance artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer, executed around 1500 and now in the Alte Pinakothek of Munich, Germany.\r The work was commissioned by goldsmith Jakob Glimm as a memorial of his first wife, Margaret Holzmann, who a died in 1500.

Some art historians identify the central panel with the Uffizi Adoration of the Magi, while according to others there was instead a group of sculptures. The Apostles on gilded background now at the Alte Pinakothek of Munich have also been associated with the polyptych: in this view, the two known paintings would form a single image on the external shutters once closed; in fact, the two share a common background, and the dress of Job's wife continues to the right panel as well.\r It is named after one of its owners, Everhard Jabach, in whose family chapel it was still hanging in the late 18th century, before being split up and scattered to different locations.\r The left panel depicts the prophet Job seated, with a desperate expression on his face, after Satan has defied him to keep his allegiance to God even in the most tremendous afflictions.

The work dates to D\u00fcrer's sojourn in Venice, and had been commissioned by Jakob Fugger, intermediary between emperor Maximilian I and Pope Julius II, during the painter's stay as the banker's guest in Augsburg.    The contract was renewed in the Italian city by the brotherhoods of the traders from Nuremberg (D\u00fcrer's hometown) and from other German cities, the latter being supported by the  Fugger family.  According to the contract, the painting, to be housed in the church of the German nation in Venice, San Bartolomeo at Rialto, should be   finished before May 1506. The subject was the Feast of the Rosary, a theme connected to the particular worship that the German citizens in Venice had towards Our Lady of the Rosary.  The execution however dragged on until September of that year, when the Doge, the Patriarch and other Venetian nobles visited D\u00fcrer's workshop to see the finished work. In a later letter written to Nurnberg's Senate in 1523, D\u00fcrer wrote how, in that occasion, the doge had proposed him the position of the Republic's painter, but he had refused. The visitors included perhaps, among other artists, Giovanni Bellini.  The work was acquired by emperor Rudolf II in 1606, who had it moved to Prague. It was assigned to the Strahov Monastery and, during the centuries, it underwent to several restorations, causing damage to the painted surface. Later it was moved to the Rudolfinum and then to the National Gallery of the Czech capital.  The painting shows the Virgin Enthroned holding the Child in the center, with two flying angels who are holding, above her, an elaborated royal crown made of gold, pearls and gems; this was a Flemish art scheme already widespread in the German area at the time. The throne's backrest is covered with a green drape and by a  baldachin which is also held by two flying cherubim. Below is an angel playing a lute, an evident homage to Giovanni Bellini's altarpieces. Mary is depicted in the act of distributing rose garlands to two groups of kneeling worshippers, portrayed on two symmetrical rows at the sides.  The two rows are headed, on the left, by Pope Julius II (who had been approved the German brotherhood with a bull in 1474), crowned by the Child and followed by a procession of religious figures; and, on the right, by the German emperor Frederick III (portrayed with the face of his son and patron of D\u00fcrer, Maximilian\u00a0I), crowned by Mary and followed by a lay procession. D\u00fcrer likely based his portrait of the emperor on a drawing by  Ambrogio de Predis, who had worked for Maximilian at Innsbruck. The pope and the emperor, considered at the time the supreme authorities of the Catholic world, have previously deposed the papal tiara and the imperial crown, and are now kneeling to receive the Madonna's blessing.  Other angels are distributing crowns of flowers, as well as St. Dominic of Guzman (protector of the adoration of Mary and of the Rosary), who stands at the side of the Virgin.

In the background are prisoners walking through to a cliff from where they are thrown down against rocks and thorny bushes, as well as scenes of fighting, stoning and hitting with huge clubs.\r At the center of the crowded scene, dressed in black, are two characters who walk placidly, apparently unaware of the horrors around them: one is D\u00fcrer's self-portrait (holding his signature), the other his friend and humanist Conrad Celtes, who had died a few months before the execution of the painting.\n", "\nArtist: Albrecht Durer\nArtwork Name: Melancholy I\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: engraving\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/melancholia-1514\n\nWikipedia Article:\nMelencolia I is a 1514 engraving by the German Renaissance master Albrecht D\u00fcrer. It is an allegorical composition which has been the subject of many interpretations. One of the most famous old master prints, it has sometimes been regarded as forming one of a conscious group of Meisterstiche (\"master prints\") with his Knight, Death and the Devil (1513) and Saint Jerome in his Study (1514).\r The engraving measures 24 \u00d7 18.8cm.\r The work has been the subject of more modern interpretation than almost any other print, including a two-volume book by Peter-Klaus Schuster, and a very influential discussion in Erwin Panofsky's D\u00fcrer monograph. The (archaically spelled) title Melencolia I appears within the engraving itself. It is the only one of D\u00fcrer's engravings to have a title in the plate. The date 1514 appears in the bottom row of the magic square, and also above D\u00fcrer's monogram at bottom right. It is likely that the \"I\" refers to the first of the three types of melancholia defined by the German humanist writer Cornelius Agrippa. In this type, Melencholia Imaginativa, which he held artists to be subject to, 'imagination' predominates over 'mind' or 'reason'.\r One interpretation suggests the image references the depressive or melancholy state and accordingly explains various elements of the picture. Among the most conspicuous are:\r An autobiographical interpretation of Melencolia I has been suggested by several historians. Iv\u00e1n Feny\u0151 considered the print a representation of the artist beset by a loss of confidence, saying: \"shortly before [D\u00fcrer] drew Melancholy, he wrote: 'what is beautiful I do not know' ... Melancholy is a lyric confession, the self-conscious introspection of the Renaissance artist, unprecedented in northern art. Erwin Panofsky is right in considering this admirable plate the spiritual self-portrait of D\u00fcrer.\"\r D\u00fcrer's Melencolia is the patroness of the City of Dreadful Night in the final canto of James Thomson's poem of that name.\n", "\nArtist: Albrecht Durer\nArtwork Name: Portrait of the Artist's Mother\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: paper\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/portrait-of-the-artist-s-mother-1514\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of the Artist's Mother at the Age of 63 (German: Bildnis der Mutter mit 63 Jahren) is a charcoal drawing from March 1514 by the German printmaker and painter Albrecht D\u00fcrer, now in the Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin. It is a tender but unflinching study of his mother, Barbara Holper (c. 1451\u20131514), completed while she was gravely ill, two months before she died. D\u00fcrer was close to his mother and after her death wrote that she had \"died hard\" and that \"I felt so grieved for her that I cannot express it\". In its bleakness of mood, the drawing has been compared to his two great 1514 engravings, Melencolia I and Madonna by the Wall. This work is her second portrait; the c. 1490 oil on oak panel painting now in Nuremberg is today generally accepted to be either an original or a copy of a lost original. It was bought in c. 1877 by the Kupferstichkabinett from the Firmin-Didot auction house in Paris during a period of acquisition of over 35 D\u00fcrer drawings by the gallery.\r Barbara Holper was the daughter of Hieronymus Holper, under whom D\u00fcrer's Hungarian father served his apprenticeship as a goldsmith. Albrecht D\u00fcrer most likely lived in the Holper household during his apprenticeship and saw his master's daughter grow from a child to a woman. Hieronymus Holper gave his daughter into marriage when D\u00fcrer's father was 40 and she was 15. Although they appear have been compatible and well-matched, according to their son they shared difficult lives and many set-backs. They had 18 children together, beginning in 1468 and ending in 1492, only two of whom survived into adulthood. D\u00fcrer biographer Jane Hutchinson suggests that Barbara Holper may have been trained and worked as a goldsmith.\r After her death her grieving son wrote \"This my pious Mother bore and brought up eighteen children; she often had the plague and many other severe and strange illnesses, and she suffered great poverty, scorn, contempt, mocking words, terrors, and great adversities. Yet she bore no malice. She feared Death much, but she said that to come before God she feared not. Also she died hard, and I marked that she saw something dreadful, for she asked for the holy-water, although, for a long time, she had not spoken. Immediately afterwards her eyes closed over. I saw also how Death smote her two great strokes to the heart, and how she closed mouth and eyes and departed with pain. I repeated to her the prayers. I felt so grieved for her that I cannot express it. God be merciful to her.\"\r D\u00fcrer presents his mother with a stark realism that at first view might seem cruel or grotesque if he had not left behind written record of his affection for her and was with her during her last days. Her face is emaciated to the point of appearing skeletal, her skin deeply wrinkled and shadowed, her eyes almost detached and her face seemingly looking up towards a void of despair. Yet his written record about both his parents are deeply compassionate, sympathetic and caring and it is accepted that the portraits are sensitive studies of the ravish of old age and illness on human flesh. While D\u00fcrer forensically detailed the effects of aging on others, he was less inclined to record its work on his own body; his last full self-portrait was completed in 1500.\n", "\nArtist: Albrecht Durer\nArtwork Name: St. Jerome in his Study\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: engraving\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/st-jerome-in-his-study-1514\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Jerome in His Study (German: Der heilige Hieronymus im Geh\u00e4us) is an engraving of 1514 by the German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Saint Jerome is shown sitting behind his desk, engrossed in work. The table, on the corner of which is a cross, is typical of the Renaissance. An imaginary line from Jerome's head passing through the cross would arrive at the skull on the window ledge, as if contrasting death and the Resurrection. The lion in the foreground is part of the traditional iconography of St. Jerome, and near it is a sleeping dog, an animal found frequently in D\u00fcrer's works, symbolizing loyalty. Both creatures are part of Jerome's story in the Golden Legend (c. 1260), which contained fanciful hagiographies of saints.\r St. Jerome in His Study is often considered as part of a group of three D\u00fcrer engravings, the other two being the well-known Melencolia I (1514) and Knight, Death and the Devil (1513). Together they have been viewed as representing the three spheres of activity recognized in medieval times: Knight, Death, and the Devil belongs to the moral sphere and the \"active life\"; Melencolia I represents the intellectual; and St. Jerome the theological and contemplative life.\r The composition is intimate, but the viewer has difficulty locating himself in relation to the picture's space. Thomas Puttfarken suggests that while the scene is very close to the observer, D\u00fcrer did not intend the viewer to feel present: \"the intimacy is not ours, but the saint's as he is engrossed in study and meditation\" (94). Art historian Erwin Panofsky comments on the perspective:\r Using a dried gourd hanging from the rafters, D\u00fcrer memorializes Jerome's courage, in the face of a long brewing philological controversy with St. Augustine in his preference for Greek over Latin nomenclature for the fast-growing plant known in Hebrew as \u05e7\u05d9\u05e7\u05d9\u05d5\u05df (qiyqayown) encountered only this once, in the Book of Jonah. The Old Testament text closes abruptly (Jonah 4) with an epistolary warning based on the emblematic trope of a fast-growing vine present in Persian narratives, and popularized widely in certain collections of Aesop's fables such as The Gourd and the Palm-tree. Jerome elected to use Hedera (from the Greek, meaning ivy) over the more common Latin cucurbita from which the related English plant name cucumber is derived, perhaps to avoid confusion while making a more perfect analogy to the typology of Christ \"I am the Vine you are the branches\". In fact Augustine's view had already prevailed by D\u00fcrer's time.\n", "\nArtist: Albrecht Durer\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Emperor Maximilian I\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/portrait-of-emperor-maximilian-i-1518\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Emperor Maximilian I is an oil painting by Albrecht D\u00fcrer, dating to 1519 and now at the Kunsthistorisches Museum of Vienna, Austria. It portrays the emperor Maximilian I.\r In the Spring of 1512, the newly elected emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg sojourned in Nuremberg, where he got acquainted with D\u00fcrer. To celebrate the emperor and his house, the artist conceived the large Triumphal Arch woodcut, for which he was rewarded with 100 yearly florins.\r In 1518, during the Diet of Augsburg, Maximilian called D\u00fcrer to portray him. The artist met the emperor in the castle and made a pencil drawing of him, from which he later painted the panel portrait. On the drawing's martig, he noted: \"Is the emperor Maximilian that I Albrecht D\u00fcrer portrayed in Augsburg, up in the high palace, in his small room, Monday 28 June 1518\".\r The oil panel was completed when the emperor had already died, with some variants from the initial drawing.

It shows the Ancient Romean heroine Lucretia (died c.\u2009510 BC), wife of Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, in a tall and narrow framing, in the act of killing herself rather than face the shame of being raped by her cousin Sextus Tarquinius. Lucretia stands in front of a cramped and harshly lit room containing the bridal bed on which she was raped. She looks to the sky, as if asking the gods to witness her suicide. Her face betraying feelings of disgrace, as she stabs herself with a sword to the belly. D\u00fcrer has earlier completed a 1508 pencil on green paper drawing of Lucretia, now in the Albertina Museum, Vienna.\r Her wound is not at the center of her belly, as in the 1508 drawing, but below her right breast, echoing Christ's lance wound. Critics have mentioned how the act is bloodless, without any of the spatterings on bed sheets usually associated with similar treatments from the time. However the painting was executed with finesse, with the brush strokes representing the cloths especially detailed, and composed of a variety of red, blue, and green pigments. The white drapery around her hips is a later addition, from around 1600.\r The panel is D\u00fcrer's second treatment of Lucretia, following a very similar 1508 drawing. Art historians tend not to view it as one of his best paintings, and it is often compared, unfavourably, to a similar work by Lucas Cranach the Elder. However, art historians see the D\u00fcrer as a less formal treatment, more inward and concerned with confronting death and dying. Between 1959-60, Alberto Giacometti completed a Sketch after Durer's Lucretia using ball-point pen on paper.\r Her face bears elements of idealisation, although for the most part she is presented as a real woman. Her expression, near identical to the 1508 drawing, is difficult to interpret, as it contains none of the passivity, chastity, or sly sidelong glances usually associated with contemporary depictions of her. She is given a monumental and statuesque pose, but without the sense of pagan sensuality present in the his 1507 Adam and Eve in the Prado, Madrid. Critics have remarked unfavourably on her sour expression, unnaturally elongated and disproportional figure, and uncomfortable contrapposto pose. The painting has been described as one of D\u00fcrer's most unpopular works, with many art historians, including Max Friedl\u00e4nder and Erwin Panofsky, commenting unfavourably on apparent qualities such as \"austerity and awkwardness\". Art historian Fedja Anzelewsky described her as \"a parody rather than an exaltation of the classical feminine figure.\"\r The feminist scholar Linda Hults observes how \"there is a mechanical quality to Lucretia's suicidal gesture; it seems to operate apart from her facial expression, and it does not seem to require the assistance of her other arm, which is oddly placed behind her back.\"\n", "\nArtist: Albrecht Durer\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Jakob Fugger\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/portrait-of-jakob-fugger\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Jakob Fugger is an oil painting by German Renaissance artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer, executed around 1520.\r Jakob Fugger was one of the richest merchants of Augsburg.

It portrays the 333\u00a0BC Battle of Issus, in which Alexander the Great secured a decisive victory over Darius III of Persia and gained crucial leverage in his campaign against the Persian Empire. The painting is widely regarded as Altdorfer's masterpiece, and is one of the most famous examples of the type of Renaissance landscape painting known as the world landscape, which here reaches an unprecedented grandeur.\r Duke William IV of Bavaria commissioned The Battle of Alexander at Issus in 1528 as part of a set of historical pieces that was to hang in his Munich residence. Modern commentators suggest that the painting, through its abundant use of anachronism, was intended to liken Alexander's heroic victory at Issus to the contemporary European conflict with the Ottoman Empire. In particular, the defeat of Suleiman the Magnificent at the Siege of Vienna may have been an inspiration for Altdorfer. A religious undercurrent is detectable, especially in the extraordinary sky; this was probably inspired by the prophecies of Daniel and contemporary concern within the Church about an impending apocalypse. The Battle of Alexander at Issus and four others that were part of William's initial set are in the Alte Pinakothek art museum in Munich.\r Alexander III of Macedon (356\u2013323\u00a0BC), best known as Alexander the Great, was an Ancient Greek king of Macedon who reigned from 336\u00a0BC until his death. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest military tacticians and strategists in history, and is presumed undefeated in battle. Renowned for his military leadership and charisma, he always led his armies personally and took to the front ranks of battle. By conquering the Persian Empire and unifying Greece, Egypt and Babylon, he forged the largest empire of the ancient world and effected the spread of Hellenism throughout Europe and Northern Africa.\r Alexander embarked on his expedition to conquer the Persian Empire in the spring of 334\u00a0BC, having pacified the warring Greek states and consolidated his military might. During the first months of the Macedonian passage into Persian Asia Minor, Darius III \u2013 king of Persia \u2013 largely ignored the presence of Alexander's 40,000\u00a0men. The Battle of the Granicus, fought in May, was Persia's first major effort to confront the invaders, but resulted in an easy victory for Alexander. Over the next year, Alexander took most of western and coastal Asia Minor by forcing the capitulation of the satrapies in his path. He continued inland, travelling northeast through Phyrgia before turning southeast toward Cilicia. After passing the Cilician Gates in October, Alexander was delayed by fever in Tarsus. Darius meanwhile mustered an army of up to 100,000 (some ancient sources posit exaggerated figures of over 600,000) and personally directed it over the eastern slopes of the Amanus Mountains. In early November, as Alexander proceeded about the Gulf of Issus from Mallus via Issus, the two armies inadvertently passed one another on opposite sides of the mountains. This was decidedly to Darius' advantage: now at the rear of Alexander, he was able to prevent retreat and block the supply lines Alexander had established at Issus. It was not until Alexander had encamped at Myriandrus, a seaport on the southeastern shores of the Gulf of \u0130skenderun, that he learned of the Persian position. He immediately retraced his route to the Pinarus River, just south of Issus, to find Darius' force assembled along the northern bank. The Battle of Issus ensued.\n", "\nArtist: Hans Baldung\nArtwork Name: Eve, the Serpent and Death\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-baldung/eve-the-serpent-and-death-1510\n\nWikipedia Article:\nEve, the Serpent and Death (or Eve, the Serpent, and Adam as Death) is a painting by the German Renaissance artist Hans Baldung, housed in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa. The date of the picture is debated, with proposals ranging from the early 1510s to between 1525 and 1530. Its four main elements are the biblical Eve, a male figure personifying death and generally likened to Adam, a serpent, and a tree trunk.\r The painting was in the collection of British politician William Angerstein before being auctioned in 1875 at Christie's as a work of Lucas Cranach the Elder, though in fact the work offers a great contrast to Cranach's many Adam and Eve's, from which only the pose of Eve is borrowed. Almost a century later, it was determined to be a Baldung work by the Scottish branch of Sotheby's, where it was auctioned in 1969.\r The buyer sold it to the National Gallery of Canada of Ottawa in 1972, where it has since been cleaned and restored.\r Baldung treated the Fall in a number of woodcuts and paintings, which he signifies by the apple and the bite of the serpent; his iconography is often as original and arresting as in this work. In this panel, the bodies are grand in scale and fill essentially the entire space, and pale foreground colors are used against a dark background. The main elements are intertwined; the serpent is coiled around the tree trunk and also around Death, who he holds to the tree. Death's right arm extends upward to grasp the apple. The serpent, which has red eyes and a weasel-like head, closes its jaws around the wrist of Death's left arm, which is at the same time grasping the left arm of Eve. Eve's left hand holds part of the serpent's tail, while her right hand holds an apple behind her back. Among Baldung's treatments of the Fall, the new element in Eve, the Serpent and Death is the active role of the snake; Adam's decrepit condition, halfway between nude and skeleton, suggests the work of poison, as if from the serpent, and the snake's grip on Adam recalls the biting of the apple in the Fall. The apple that each of the figures holds is the symbolic origin of the present scene, in which \"everything is dependent on and implicated in everything else\".\r In the background is a dense forest while two more tree trunks, slim, angled, and parallel, occupy the middle ground. A marguerite, probably an oxeye daisy (Hieatt), sits at the roots of the main tree trunk, in front of Death's right heel.\n", "\nArtist: Hans Baldung\nArtwork Name: The Trinity and Mystic Piet\u00e0\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-baldung/the-trinity-and-mystic-pieta\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Trinity and Mystic Piet\u00e0 is an oil on oak painting undertaken in 1512 by the German artist Hans Baldung.\r The painting shows God supporting his son, with the Holy Spirit above them, represented by a dove; the holy trinity are joined by the weeping figures of St. John and the Virgin Mary. The inclusion of God supporting his crucified son within the picture was popular during the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, but is otherwise rare in art history. Beneath the holy figures are a series of smaller individuals, who are assumed by art historians to be the family who commissioned the painting; this is likely to be the Bettschold and Rothschild families, given the coats of arms present in the lower corners. The donors were often depicted during the Middle Ages as much smaller than the holy figures, in order to emphasise the difference between them.\r The painting was acquired in 1894 by the National Gallery, London, who still hold the piece as at 2015.

It is considered one of the \"masterpieces of Menzel's maturity\", and the artist deemed it his best painting.\r The painting depicts a red colored wall of the artist's studio at night, upon which are hung a series of plaster casts illuminated from below. The casts include portrait busts, death masks and life masks of friends of the artist, children, classical personae such as Dante, Schiller, and possibly Goethe or Wagner, a dog, and male and female torsos; art historian Werner Hofmann saw this assemblage as a conscious blurring of \"the dividing line between fame and anonymity.\" Numerous commentators have noted that the array of dramatically lit casts \"convey an uncanny impression of quasi-animateness.\"\r Studio Wall was preceded by a work of the same title painted in 1852, an oil on paper now in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin. That painting features casts of two arms and a separate hand, the arms arranged so as to suggest a relationship to a body from which they have been removed.\r Studio Wall is also seen as related to Menzel's larger painting Iron Rolling Mill (1872\u20131875), for which it may have served as a study in dramatic lighting, yet it has greater import than that of a merely preparatory exercise, and may have functioned as a kind of memorial: the central death mask is that of the artist's friend Friedrich Eggers, the first critic sympathetic to Menzel's work. Eggers died in August 1872, and the painting is dated from October of that year. A contemplation on the transience of life, Studio Wall is also a bravura piece of alla prima painting.\r Interpretations of the work vary greatly. For art historian Julius Meier-Graefe, Studio Wall was a harmonious example of pictorial unity; to the contrary, Hofmann saw the painting as a \"coded manifesto\", a rejection by Menzel of academic canons in favor of an aesthetic that celebrated the fragmentary and disjointed, and symbolic of the triumph of painting over sculpture. Fried rejects Hofman's view of fragmentariness and anti-academicism, seeing the picture as a structured composition of objects arranged in successive rows. For Fried the likeliest allegorical meaning would be the sublimation of tangible existence to that of \"phantasmagorias\", a world inhabited by ghosts in the form of plaster casts.\n", "\nArtist: Ernst Ludwig Kirchner\nArtwork Name: The Red Tower in Halle\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/ernst-ludwig-kirchner/the-red-tower-in-halle-1915\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Red Tower in Halle (German: Der Rote Turm in Halle) is a 1915 oil on canvas painting by a German expressionist painter and printmaker Ernst Ludwig Kirchner.

El Greco's signature on the base of the central candelabrum was discovered in 1983. The discovery of the Dormition led to the attribution of three other signed works of \"Dom\u00e9nicos\" to El Greco (Modena Triptych, St. Luke Painting the Virgin and Child, and The Adoration of the Magi) and then to the acceptance as authentic of more works, signed or not (such as The Passion of Christ (Piet\u00e0 with Angels), painted in 1566).\r This discovery constituted a significant advance in the understanding of El Greco's formation and early career. The painting combines post-Byzantine and Italian mannerist stylistic and iconographic elements. El Greco is now seen as an artist with a formative training on Crete; a series of works illuminate the style of early El Greco, some painted while he was still in Crete, some from his period in Venice, and some from his subsequent stay in Rome.\r The icon, which retains its function as an object of veneration in the Church of the Dormition of the Virgin in Syros, was probably brought to the island during the Greek War of Independence. The icon conforms closely to the established pattern for this subject, which was very common in the Orthodox Church in which El Greco was raised and was influenced by. Nevertheless, it has lost some elements of the traditional Byzantine austerity, adopting traits of the Renaissance engravings.\r The composition of the Burial of the Count of Orgaz has been closely related to the Byzantine iconography of the Dormition of the Theotokos. The examples that have been used to support this point of view have a close relationship with the icon of the Dormition by El Greco that was discovered in 1983 in the church of the same name in Syros. Marina Lambraki-Plaka believes that such a connection exists. Robert Byron, according to whom the iconographic type of the Dormition was the compositional model for The Burial of the Count of Orgaz, asserts that El Greco as a genuine Byzantine painter worked throughout his life with a repertoire of components and motifs at will, depending on the narrative and expressive requirements of the art.\n", "\nArtist: El Greco\nArtwork Name: Christ driving the traders from the temple\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/el-greco/christ-driving-the-traders-from-the-temple-1570\n\nWikipedia Article:\nChrist Driving the Money Changers from the Temple is a painting by El Greco, from 1568, now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., in the United States.

It shows the Martyred Saint in an atypical kneeling posture which has led some scholars to believe it to be a compositional quotation of various works by other great masters whom the artist admired. The painting is currently on display in the Palencia Cathedral.\r The precise details of the provenance of this particular work are, of necessity, based largely on conjecture. Based on stylistic clues and the available documentation, scholars have dated it to El Greco's first decade in Spain, or roughly 1576-79. Many scholars have suggested that as El Greco's first major commission in Spain, the decoration of three altarpieces in the convent Santo Domingo el Antiguo (Monastery of Saint Dominic of Silos (the Old))\u2014as indicated by a contract signed a month after that for The Disrobing of Christ which would hang in the vestry of the Cathedral at Toledo\u2014was obtained for him by Diego de Castilla, dean of the cathedral and father of El Greco's friend Luis it might be logically assumed that the Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian was painted for the same patron. Indeed, the assumption, based on stylistic similarity and the historical timeline of the Cretan painter's career, seems to have obtained such currency that Johnathan Brown, for example, in his discussion of the Palencia Sebastian, simply notes that it was \u201cpossibly painted for Diego de Castilla\u201d without further discussion. And yet, this assignment of patronage is not universally accepted. Providing an alternative theory of how the painting came to Palencia, Jesus San Martin Payo, based on his study of a sixteenth century manuscript by Dr. Ascencio Garcia on the history of the diocese of Palencia, suggests that the painting was originally owned by Don Juan Alonso de Cordoba the \u201cright arm of the bishop don Juan Ramirez Zapata de Cardenas, patron of the chapel of San Jeronimo, and in whose sacristy\u201d (brazo derecho del obispo don Juan Ramirez Zapata de Cardenas, patrono de la capilla de San Jeronimo, y en cuya sacristia) the painting by El Greco can currently be found. As Juan Ramirez Zapata de Cardenas served as Bishop of the diocese from 1570 until his death in 1577, this alternative theory would indicate that the Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian would actually predate El Espolio, or The Disrobing of Christ, which is generally considered the artist's first known Spanish work.\r The painting depicts Saint Sebastian, as a victim of Diocletian's suppression of Christianity during the 4th century AD. According to popular legend, Sebastian was bound to a tree and shot with arrows, but was miraculously rescued and healed, only to achieve martyrdom when he was clubbed to death shortly thereafter. Saint Sebastian is a popular saint in both the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox traditions. Pierced with arrows\u2014a symbol associated with divine punishment in the form of pestilence since antiquity\u2014and yet miraculously saved from near death, Saint Sebastian was often invoked to intercede on the behalf of plague victims in the 15th and 16th centuries when the painting would have first been put on display. Perhaps because of the popularity of Saint Sebastian during the second plague pandemic, or because his martyrdom offered Counter-Reformation era artists one of the few opportunities to portray the nude in religious art, there are numerous examples of the Saint painted by El Greco and his contemporaries and an established iconographical schema for his portrayal.\n", "\nArtist: El Greco\nArtwork Name: The Disrobing of Christ\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/el-greco/the-disrobing-of-christ-1579\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Disrobing of Christ or El Expolio (Latin: Exspol\u012dum) is a painting begun in the summer of 1577 and completed in the spring of 1579 for the High Altar of the sacristy of the Cathedral of Toledo, where it still normally hangs. In late 2013 it was on temporary display at the Prado in Madrid (with the other El Grecos), following a period of cleaning and conservation work there; it was returned to Toledo in 2014. It is one of El Greco's most famous works. A document dated July 2, 1577 which refers to this painting is the earliest record of El Greco's presence in Spain. The commission for the painting was secured thanks to El Greco's friendship from Rome with Luis, the son of Diego de Castilla, the dean of the Cathedral of Toledo. De Castilla senior also arranged El Greco's other major commission, on which he worked simultaneously, the paintings for the Toledan church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo.\r The painting shows Christ looking up to Heaven with an expression of serenity; His idealized figure seems segregated from the other people and the violence surrounding him. A figure dressed in black in the background points at Christ accusingly, while two others argue over who will have His garments. A man in green to Christ's left holds Him firmly with a rope and is about to rip off His robe in preparation for his crucifixion. At the lower right, a man in yellow bends over the cross and drills a hole to facilitate the insertion of a nail to be driven through Christ's feet. The radiant face of the Savior is violently juxtaposed to the coarse figures of the executioners, who are amassed around Him creating an impression of disturbance with their movements, their gestures and lances.\r Christ is clad in a bright red robe; it is on this red tunic that El Greco concentrated the full expressive force of his art. The purple garment (a metonymic symbol of the divine passion) is spread out in a light fold; only the chromatic couple of yellow and blue in the foreground raises a separate note which approaches, in power, the glorifying hymn of the red.\r In the left foreground, the three Marys contemplate the scene with distress. Their presence was objected to by the Cathedral authorities, since they are not mentioned as present at this point in the Gospels. Greco probably took this detail, with some others like the rope around Christ's wrists, from the account in the Meditations on the Passion of Jesus Christ by Saint Bonaventure. The placement of the tormentors higher than the head of Christ also was cited by the commissioners of the Cathedral in the arbitration process over the price.\r In designing the composition vertically and compactly in the foreground El Greco seems to have been motivated by the desire to show the oppression of Christ by his cruel tormentors. The figure of Christ, robust, tall and tranquil, dominates the center of the composition which is built vertically like a wall. El Greco chose a method of space elimination that is common to middle and late 16th-century Mannerists. According to Wethey, El Greco \"probably recalled late Byzantine paintings in which the superposition of heads row upon row is employed to suggest a crowd\".\n", "\nArtist: El Greco\nArtwork Name: St. Veronica with the Holy Shroud\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/el-greco/st-veronica-with-the-holy-shroud\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Veronica was a woman of Jerusalem in the first century AD, according to Catholic tradition. A celebrated saint in many pious Christian countries, the Acta Sanctorum published by the Bollandists listed her feast under July 12, but the German Jesuit scholar Joseph Braun cited her commemoration in Festi Marianni on 13 January.\r According to Church tradition, Veronica was moved with sympathy when she saw Jesus carrying his cross to Golgotha and gave him her veil that he might wipe his forehead. Jesus accepted the offering, held it to his face, and then handed it back to her\u2014the image of his face miraculously impressed upon it. This piece of cloth became known as the Veil of Veronica.\r The name \"Veronica\" itself is a Latinisation of Berenice (Greek: \u0392\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7, Berenik\u0113, with a secondary form Beronike), a Macedonian name, meaning \"bearer of victory\". The woman who offered her veil to Jesus was known by this name in the Byzantine East, but in the Latin West the name took a life of its own. As proven by a medieval text, \"Veronica\" was used by the 13th century as a designation for a relic venerated in Rome as the true image of Jesus. Since the Latin word for \"true\" or \"authentic\" happens to be vera, the theory emerged that the name itself is derived from the Latin phrase \"true image\", vera icon (one Latin word for image is icon, derived from Greek: \u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1, eikona). In the 13th-century text and also in some later sources the term Veronica was used for the veil, not the person, but for centuries it has been better known as the name of the woman. The claim that the name Veronica is derived from vera icon proved to be very persistent and we encounter it until today. The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica says this about the legend:\r The Catholic Encyclopaedia of 1913 had this to say about the growth of the legend (translations in italics added):\r The reference to Abgar is related to a similar legend in the Eastern Church, the Image of Edessa or Mandylion.\r There is no reference to the story of St Veronica and her veil in the canonical Gospels. She is known as the woman who wiped Jesus's face with her veil. Then the image of Jesus's face appeared on it. The closest is the miracle of the woman who was healed by touching the hem of Jesus\u2019s garment (Luke 8:43\u201348); her name is later identified as Veronica by the apocryphal \"Acts of Pilate\". The story was later elaborated in the 11th century by adding that Christ gave her a portrait of himself on a cloth, with which she later cured the Emperor Tiberius. The linking of this with the bearing of the cross in the Passion, and the miraculous appearance of the image only occurs around 1380, in the internationally popular book Meditations on the life of Christ. The story of Veronica is celebrated in the sixth Station of the Cross in many Anglican, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist and Western Orthodox churches.\r According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, the name \"Veronica\" comes from the Latin vera, meaning \"true\" or \"Truthful\", and the Greek eikon, meaning \"image\"; the Veil of Veronica was therefore largely regarded in medieval times as the \"true image\", the truthful representation of Jesus, preceding the Shroud of Turin.\n", "\nArtist: El Greco\nArtwork Name: The Knight with his hand on his breast\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/el-greco/the-knight-with-his-hand-on-his-breast\n\nWikipedia Article:\nEl caballero de la mano en el pecho, variously translated into English as The Gentleman with His Hand at His Breast, Gentleman with his Hand on his Chest or The Nobleman with his Hand on his Chest, is an oil painting by El Greco.\r Painted in Toledo around 1580, and on display at the Museo del Prado, it is the most famous of a series of secular portraits of unknown gentlemen, all of them dressed in black and wearing white ruffs, against dark backgrounds.\r Some authors suggest it may be a portrait of Juan de Silva y Ribera, 3rd Marquis of Montemayor and warden of the Alcazar of Toledo.

Widely considered among his finest works, it illustrates a popular local legend of his time. An exceptionally large painting, it is very clearly divided into two sections, heavenly above and terrestrial below, but it gives little impression of duality. The upper and lower sections are brought together compositionally.\r The theme of the painting is inspired from a legend of the beginning of the 14th century. In 1312, a certain Don Gonzalo Ruiz, native of Toledo, and Se\u00f1or of the town of Orgaz, died (his family later received the title of Count, by which he is generally and posthumously known). The Count of Orgaz was a pious man who, among other charitable acts, left a sum of money for the enlargement and adornment of the church of Santo Tom\u00e9 (El Greco's parish church). He was also a philanthropist and a right-thinking Knight. According to the legend, at the time he was buried, Saint Stephen and Saint Augustine descended in person from the heavens and buried him by their own hands in front of the dazzled eyes of those present.\r The painting was commissioned by Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez, the parish priest of Santo Tom\u00e9, for the side-chapel of the Virgin of the church of Santo Tom\u00e9, and was executed by El Greco between 1586\u20131588. N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who had initiated a project to refurbish the Count's burial chapel, is portrayed in the painting reading.\r Already in 1588, people were flocking to Orgaz to see the painting. This immediate popular reception depended, however, on the lifelike portrayal of the notable men of Toledo of the time. It was the custom for the eminent and noble men of the town to assist the burial of the noble-born, and it was stipulated in the contract that the scene should be represented in this manner.\r El Greco would pay homage to the aristocracy of the spirit, the clergy, the jurists, the poets and the scholars, who honored him and his art with their esteem, by immortalizing them in the painting. The Burial of the Count of Orgaz has been admired not only for its art, but also because it was a gallery of portraits of the most eminent social figures of that time in Toledo. Indeed, this painting is sufficient to rank El Greco among the few great portrait painters.\r The painting is very clearly divided into two zones; above, heaven is evoked by swirling icy clouds, semiabstract in their shape, and the saints are tall and phantomlike; below, all is normal in the scale and proportions of the figures. The upper and lower zones are brought together compositionally (e.g., by the standing figures, by their varied participation in the earthly and heavenly event, by the torches, cross etc.).\r The scene of the miracle is depicted in the lower part of the composition, in the terrestrial section. In the upper part, the heavenly one, the clouds have parted to receive this just man in Paradise. Christ clad in white and in glory, is the crowning point of the triangle formed by the figures of the Madonna and Saint John the Baptist in the traditional Orthodox composition of the Deesis. These three central figures of heavenly glory are surrounded by apostles, martyrs, Biblical kings and the just (among whom was Philip II of Spain, though he was still alive).\n", "\nArtist: El Greco\nArtwork Name: St. Paul and St. Peter\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/el-greco/st-paul-and-st-peter-1595-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Peter and Saint Paul is a painting by the Cretan-Spanish artist El Greco.

It is currently on display at the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, who purchased the work in 1932.\r El Greco completed Saint Peter and Saint Paul between 1590 and 1600, while living in Toledo, Spain. The painting depicts saints Peter and Paul, two of the Apostles of Jesus. According to the guide of the Museu Nacional d\u2019Art de Catalunya, the painting is \u201cenriched by modern use of colour, the fruit of the lessons the artist had learned in Venice.\u201d El Greco created a sense of a halo around the heads of the saints by providing an intense blue opening in the background clouds. The placement of the hands of the saint, crossed without actually touching, symbolizes a possible disagreement between the two. The older Peter, on left, is gesturing towards Paul, suggesting a sign of surrender in the disagreement.\r Dom\u00e9nikos Theotok\u00f3poulos was born around 1541 in what is modern day Heraklion, Crete. The nickname El Greco is Italian and means \u201cThe Greek\u201d, reflecting his citizenship and the time he spent in Italy. In the 1560s, El Greco moved to Venice, where he studied painting under Titian and learned the techniques of Renaissance painting. El Greco moved in 1577 to Toledo, Spain, where he completed many of the masterpieces attributed to him. El Greco died in Toledo in April 1614. Today, El Greco is seen as a major influence for Cubism and Expressionism, as well as artists such as Picasso and C\u00e9zanne.\r The figure on the left in El Greco\u2019s Saint Peter and Saint Paul can be identified as Saint Peter. In the Bible, Peter is one of the first disciples that Jesus calls upon. In the Book of Matthew, Jesus said to Peter, \u201cAnd I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\"  El Greco included the keys of heaven in this painting, as seen in the left hand of Peter.\r On the right of the painting is Saint Paul. Paul was one of the major contributors to the Bible, as well the founder of many Christian churches. Paul was born Jewish and lived under these beliefs until he was visited, on the street, by the resurrected Jesus, causing his conversion to Christianity. In El Greco\u2019s painting, Paul is depicted holding a sword, a symbol of his martyrdom for his Christian beliefs.\r The Museu Nacional d\u2019Art de Catalunya purchased El Greco\u2019s Saint Paul and Saint Paul in 1932. The painting was part of a large collection the museum purchased from Lluis Plandiura, a Catalan politician.

M. W. Turner and Claude Monet, among others. Most notable is the distinct color contrast between the dark and somber skies above and the glowing green hills below. While influenced by the Mannerist style, El Greco's expressive handling of color and form is without parallel in the history of art. In this painting, he takes liberties with the actual layout of Toledo insofar as certain building locations are re-arranged. However, the location of the Castle of San Servando, on the left, is accurately depicted. El Greco's signature appears in the lower-right corner.\r Landscape paintings were rare among Spanish paintings of the Renaissance and Baroque periods. The Council of Trent's ban against landscape painting lends credence to the idea that this work may stand as the first Spanish landscape painting of its time. It is thought that this painting's enigmatic symbolism could be related to the mysticism that infused the city during the period. The English art historian David Davies asserts that the philosophies of Platonism and ancient Neo-Platonism, the works of Plotinus and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, the texts of the Church fathers and the liturgy offer the keys to the understanding of El Greco's style. Summarizing the ensuing scholarly debate on this issue, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez Lopera, curator at the Museo del Prado, Madrid, concludes that the presence of \"Byzantine memories\" is obvious in El Greco's mature works, though there are still some obscure issues concerning his Byzantine origins needing further illumination.\n", "\nArtist: El Greco\nArtwork Name: Christ driving the Traders from the Temple\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/el-greco/christ-driving-the-traders-from-the-temple-1600\n\nWikipedia Article:\nChrist Driving the Money Changers from the Temple is a 1600 painting by El Greco, now in the National Gallery in London, England.

It is part of a collection at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C..\r The painting depicts the Greek and Roman mythological story of the deaths of Laoco\u00f6n, a Trojan priest of Poseidon, and his two sons Antiphantes and Thymbraeus. Laoco\u00f6n and his sons were strangled by sea serpents, a punishment sent by the gods after Laoco\u00f6n attempted to warn his countrymen about the Trojan horse. Although inspired by the recently discovered monumental Hellenistic sculpture Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons in Rome, Laoco\u00f6n is a product of Mannerism, an artistic movement originating in Italy during the 16th century that countered the artistic ideals of the Renaissance. El Greco\u2019s painting deliberately breaks away from the balance and harmony of Renaissance art with its strong emotional atmosphere and distorted figures.\r El Greco's oil painting of Laoco\u00f6n represents the influence of both classical mythology and artistry.\r According to Greco-Roman mythology, Laoco\u00f6n was a figure in the Trojan War waged between the Achaeans (Greeks) and Trojans. Laoco\u00f6n\u2019s tale appears in many of the numerous classical texts concerning the Trojan War. In particular, Laoco\u00f6n is a minor character in the Aeneid by Roman poet Virgil and the Epic Cycle, a distinct collection of Ancient Greek epic poems.\r Laoco\u00f6n became involved in the war after Greek soldiers, frustrated by their unsuccessful ten-year siege of the city, devised a ruse to end the war: the hollow Trojan Horse filled with Greek soldiers. Laoco\u00f6n attempted to warn his compatriots that the horse was a \u201cdeadly fraud\u201d instead of a gift, but the Trojans did not heed the warning. Believing that the war was over, the Trojans triumphantly brought the horse within their city walls and initiated a catastrophic series of events that brought about the sack of Troy.\r Laoco\u00f6n was killed by divine execution from the gods, who supported the Greeks in the Trojan War and sent the sea serpents as punishment. Laoco\u00f6n\u2019s death is the subject of a famous monumental Hellenistic sculpture, known as Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons. The 1st-century BCE marble sculpture was created by Athenadoros, Agesander, and Polydoros of Rhodes. The Laoco\u00f6n group captures a climactic moment, as Laoco\u00f6n lets out an anguished yell and struggles beside his sons against Athena\u2019s sea serpents. Unearthed in Rome in 1506, the sculpture enamored Renaissance artists with its idealized proportions and graceful, muscular figures. Laoco\u00f6n and his Sons most likely served as artistic inspiration for El Greco, who would depict the subject during his \u201cSpanish Period.\u201d\r El Greco\u2019s version of the classical subject captures the last dying struggle of Laoco\u00f6n and his sons. Laoco\u00f6n, the central figure of the painting, lies down in agony on the undulating, dark rocks of the foreground. Sprawled against the foreshortened, dead body of one of his sons, Laoco\u00f6n clings to life as a serpent bites his head. On the left, Laoco\u00f6n\u2019s standing son contorts in pain, writhing as a serpent swoops in towards his abdomen. Flanking the scene on the right are Apollo and Artemis, who watch the grisly scene unfold. An unfinished figure consisting only of a head and leg also appears on the right.\n", "\nArtist: El Greco\nArtwork Name: Opening of the fifth seal (The vision of Saint John the Divine)\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/el-greco/opening-of-the-fifth-seal-the-vision-of-saint-john-the-divine\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Opening of the Fifth Seal (or The Fifth Seal of the Apocalypse or The Vision of Saint John) was painted in the last years of El Greco's life for a side-altar of the church of Saint John the Baptist outside the walls of Toledo. Before 1908 El Greco's painting was referred to as Profane Love. Cossio had doubts about the title and suggested the Opening of the Fifth Seal. The Metropolitan Museum, where the painting is kept, comments: \"the picture is unfinished and much damaged and abraded.\"\r The very subject is taken from the Book of Revelation (6:9\u201311), where the souls of persecuted martyrs cry out to God for justice upon their persecutors on Earth. The ecstatic figure of St. John dominates the canvas, while behind him naked souls writhe in a chaotic storm of emotion as they receive white robes of salvation.\r The upper portion of the canvas appears to have been considerably cut down (it was destroyed in 1880). This lost upper portion may have resembled that of another altarpiece, the Concert of Angels, painted by El Greco for the same church, and also cut off. Many believed that the bottom section, which has been preserved, depicted profane love, while the missing upper part depicted divine love.\r In the 19th century, the painting was owned by Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo, Prime Minister of Spain. Dissatisfied with the poor condition of the work, he had it \"restored\" around 1880. The restorers actually trimmed it by at least 175 centimetres (68.9\u00a0in), leaving John the Evangelist emphatically pointing nowhere. It was this strange quirk in composition that perhaps intrigued modern viewers the most and contributed to the painting's fame in modernist circles.\r After C\u00e1novas' death in 1897, the painting was sold for 1,000 pesetas to Ignacio Zuloaga, a painter who was instrumental in reviving European interest in El Greco. The painting may be seen in the background of his work Mis amigos, representing several notable members of the Generation of '98. Zuloaga is known to have demonstrated the painting to Pablo Picasso and Rainer Maria Rilke. He declared it as possessing a \"visionary power\" that made it a \"precursor of modernism\". In 1956, the Zuloaga Museum sold this artwork to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, where it is on exhibit today.\r It has been suggested that the Opening of the Fifth Seal served as an inspiration for the early Cubist works of Pablo Picasso, especially Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, which mirrors the expressionistic angularity of the painting. When Picasso was working on Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, he visited his friend Zuloaga in his studio in Paris and studied El Greco's Opening of the Fifth Seal. The relation between Les Demoiselles d'Avignon and the Opening of the Fifth Seal was pinpointed in the early 1980s, when the stylistic similarities and the relationship between the motifs of both works were analysed. Art historian Ron Johnson was the first to focus on the relationship between the two paintings. According to John Richardson, a British art historian, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon \"turns out to have a few more answers to give once we realize that the painting owes at least as much to El Greco as C\u00e9zanne\".\n", "\nArtist: El Greco\nArtwork Name: View and plan of Toledo\nArtwork Genre: landscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/el-greco/view-and-plan-of-toledo\n\nWikipedia Article:\nView and Plan of Toledo is a work of El Greco, made in 1608 during his last period.

This fostered the assumption that it was commissioned by the city council. The enormous detail that was made on the plane caused many scholars to guess that this is a work of Jorge Manuel, son of the painter and expert in architecture.\r At the top of the canvas is the Virgin Mary, accompanied by a court of angels carrying the chasuble of San Ildefonso. In this work it could be read as an anticipation of impressionism, and even Paul C\u00e9zanne.\r The painting was probably commissioned by Pedro de Salazar y Mendoza.

He wears a green turban, white tabard over pantaloons, and a jacket; around his waist is a golden belt, to which prayer beads are attached, and over his shoulder is a shawl. He appears to be struggling to control his anger\u00a0\u2013 as would be expected from Javanese gentry\u00a0\u2013 while the Europeans' eyes are static and avoid the eyes of others.\r De Kock, the captor, stands to Diponegoro's left, at the same level as the guerrilla. Further to the left are various Dutch officers, identified by the historian and Diponegoro biographer Peter Carey as Colonel Louis du Perr, Lieutenant-Colonel W.A. Roest, and Major-Adjutant Francois Victor Henri Antoine Ridder de Stuer. To the prince's right stands a Javanese man identified by Carey as Diponegoro's son, Diponegoro the Younger, followed by Resident of Kedu Franciscus Gerardus Valck, Major Johan Jacob Peri\u00e9, and Captain Johan Jacob Roeps. At Diponegoro's feet, a woman\u00a0\u2013 possibly his wife Raden Ayu R\u011btnaningsih\u00a0\u2013 reaches out to grab him.\r The view from the northeast shows a still morning scene, with no wind blowing, and centered around Diponegoro. Saleh gives the painting depth of field, showing the soldiers closest to the front in crisp detail, while blurring the details of those in the back rows. The heads of the Dutchmen depicted appear to be slightly too large for their bodies, while those of the Javanese soldiers are of proper proportions. The painter, Raden Saleh, inserted himself into the painting twice: as a soldier bowing to the captured leader, and as a soldier facing the viewer.\r This painting measures 112 by 178 centimetres (44\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a070\u00a0in).\r Diponegoro (1785\u20131855), a descendant of the Sultans of Yogyakarta, was passed over several times for ascension to the throne. In 1825, after declaring himself Ratu Adil and his enemies infidels for their lax practice of Islam, he began a war against the reigning sultan and the Dutch colonial government. In the five-year struggle that followed, which was waged over much of central Java, over 200,000 Javanese and 15,000 Dutch soldiers were killed. On 28 March 1830, with most other guerrilla leaders captured, Diponegoro was invited to come to Lieutenant General De Kock's home in Magelang to negotiate an end of hostilities and guaranteed safety of passage. There, after three hours, Diponegoro was arrested. He was exiled to Makassar, Sulawesi, where he remained until his death.\r Saleh's depiction is not the only painted version of Diponegoro's capture. An earlier version, The Submission of Prince Dipo Negoro to General De Kock, was completed c. 1835 by Nicolaas Pieneman on commission by De Kock or his family. Rather than an angry and defiant man, Pieneman presented a submissive and beaten Diponegoro, standing lower than his captor and thus symbolically having less power. Overall, Pieneman's painting gives the impression that, although De Kock is acting sternly in exiling Diponegoro, it is in the best interest of the Javanese. The author Susie Protschky describes both Pieneman and Saleh's works as \"two of the best known history paintings from the Indies\".\n", "\nArtist: Donatello\nArtwork Name: Saint Mark\nArtwork Genre: sculpture\nArtwork Media: marble\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/donatello/saint-mark-1413\n\nWikipedia Article:\nDonatello's Saint Mark (1411\u20131413) is a marble statue that stands approximately seven feet and nine inches high and is displayed in the museum of the Orsanmichele church, Florence. It originally was displayed in an exterior niche of the church, where a copy now stands.   Donatello was commissioned by the linen weavers' guild to complete three pieces for the project.  St. Mark was the first of his contributions. The niche itself was not of Donatello's hand, but created most probably by two stone carvers named Perfetto di Giovanni and Albizzo di Pietro.  Donatello's sculpture is notable for its detailed realism, evidence of the artist's skills.  Even the veins of St. Mark's left hand are visible as he holds a text upon his hip. or natural pose, is used with Donatello's St. Mark.  The saint has more weight on his right leg, his left knee is bent, and his torso is slightly twisted.  The style is much more naturalistic than the symmetry and unrealistic nature of art from the Dark Ages. Also Donatello's sculpture differs from medieval works in the way that drapery is used, specifically in that St. Mark's figure is revealed by a realistic draping of linen.  According to Renaissance scholar Gene A. Brucker, Donatello's statue of St. Mark \"is generally recognized as the first Renaissance monument.\" (Renaissance Florence, 244)  According to Vasari's text The Lives of the Artists, written 140 years after the completion of St. Mark, the linen workers' guild originally rejected the sculpture because it appeared unnatural when set at street level.  This was due to proportion adjustments made for its final resting place in the niche, well above street level.  The head and torso were made larger as they would be further away from the viewer.  Donatello promised to make adjustments, so he covered the statue with a cloth, set the statue in the niche above the street, and without touching the statue for 15 days, once again revealed it to the guild.  With its location above the viewer, the proportions looked perfect and the linen weaver's guild accepted the statue.

It is housed in the Convent of San Domenico, Fiesole, central Italy. The background was repainted by Lorenzo di Credi in 1501.\r The altarpiece is among the earliest known works by Fra Angelico. It was originally commissioned for the high altar in the convent's church, but was later moved to a side altar where it is currently visible.\r In 1501 Lorenzo di Credi repainted the background, which was probably gilded, with a more modern landscape featuring a throne with baldachin, trompe-l'oeil reliefs and two landscapes between pillars. The Gothic cusps were also eliminated in that occasion.\r The work is a Maest\u00e0, a Madonna enthroned, a theme particularly fashionable in Florentine art at the time. The central group with the Madonna and Child is surrounded by eight adoring angels depicted in smaller size. The saints Thomas of Aquino, Barnabas, Dominic and Peter of Verona are at the sides: these were three saints of the Dominican Order (the same owning the convent) and the namesake of Barnaba degli Agli, a Florentine man who had donated 6,000 florins for the convent's restoration and enlargement.\r The naked Child is shown while grasping two flowers: a white rose, symbol of purity, and a red one, a forecast of his future passion connected with the Eucharist: the panel was in fact painted for the church's high altar, where the celebration of this sacrament occurs.\r The composition resembles that of Masaccio's San Giovenale Triptych (1422). The scheme is also similar to the cartoon of the Assumption by Lorenzo Ghiberti for the windows in the fa\u00e7ade of Florence Cathedral (1404\u20131405). It is also one of the most ancient polyptychs in which the figures are in the same painted surface, without being divided into different compartments.\r Elements such as the less evolved perspective and the tile pavements (also found in an anonymous Florentine triptych from 1419 and an altarpiece by Angelico himself at San Gimignano) led to the datation of some three years before his San Pietro Martire Triptych, which is documented from 1428.\r The work had a predella, now at the National Gallery, London and portraying Adoration of Saints, Prophets and Members of the Dominican Order. The latter also houses a tondo with St. Romulus, perhaps located above the polyptych.

It is now in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre of Paris, France.

Some art historians, such as John Pope-Hennessy, date it instead to Angelico's visit to Rome (1450) what is known as two simmm to similarities with the Santa Lucia de' Magnoli Altarpiece by Domenico Veneziano (c. 1445) or the Gothic tabernacles in the Vatican's Niccoline Chapel (1446-1448).\r The painting was brought to France as a result of the pillages of the Napoleonic Wars. Like several other artworks, it was not given back with the excuse of its large size.\r The work shows several differences from the earlier Coronation now at the Uffizi. The gilded background has disappeared, replaced by a more realistic light blue sky. The composition is more advanced, perhaps inspired to the innovation introduced by Masaccio. Angelico here depicts a rich cyborium with Gothic triple mullionss, supported by a series of polychrome marble steps, as the set of the Incoronation. Elements such as the twisted columns show similarities with the tabernacles painted in the frescoes of the Niccoline Chapel in Rome.\r Such as in the Florence painting, the angels and the saints form the audience at the side of the central scene, but the figures are more defined and some are shown from back, and the pavement's tiles are painted according to geometrical perspective. Pope-Hennessy supposed that the angels were influenced by those in the San Brizio Chapel of Orvieto Cathedral (1447).\r The work was executed with the extensive help of assistants, especially in the right side: for example, St. Catherine's wheel is painted approximatively, and some of the saints in this side have less expressive faces.\r The painting has a predella with scenes portraying the Miracles of St. Dominic and, in the middle, the Resurrection of Christ.

Two panels of the predella which once was part of the work are known: they portray the Marriage and the Funeral of the Virgin, and are currently exhibited in the museum of San Marco, Florence.\r The altarpiece arrived at the Uffizi in 1825.

The painting has a mystic tone found in other Fra Angelico works, with a large crowd of saints, angels and blessed figures enhancing this aspect.

The date of the work is unknown and has been assigned by various scholars to different points in Pisanello\u2019s career, but the National Gallery's website currently dates it to \"about 1438\u201342\".\r The work depicts Saint Eustace before a stag, between the antlers of which is a crucifix, as described in the Golden Legend. Although a similar story is told of Saint Hubert, the identification of the figure as Saint Eustace is based on the fact that Pisanello painted Saint Eustace in Sant'Anastasia. Saint Hubert\u2019s depiction in Italian art during this period is also unlikely.\r Saint Eustace is portrayed as a huntsman dressed in the height of court fashion, wearing a golden tunic and blue headdress. The patron was therefore given the opportunity to appreciate the work as a devotional piece in addition to identifying with the aristocratic pastime of hunting and chivalric ideology. The patron for whom the work was painted is, however, unknown. Suggested patrons include the Gonzaga and Filippo Maria Visconti. Leonello or Borso d\u2019Este, keen huntsmen, have also been proposed. It is possible that the saint could be a profile portrait of the patron.\r The hunting scene allowed Pisanello to demonstrate his considerable skill in depicting animals and birds in a naturalistic but decorative way. Drawings of them from pattern books were undoubtedly used. The animals are portrayed at various scales and scattered around a \u2018tipped-up\u2019 landscape not dissimilar to those visible in Netherlandish tapestries. The landscape's construction also demonstrates a familiarity with illuminations in manuscript hunting treatises, such as the canonical Livre de Chasse by Gaston Phoebus.\r The purpose of the blank scroll in the foreground of the painting is unknown. There is no evidence to suggest it ever contained any lettering. Its original intention may have been to carry the words of Christ to Saint Eustace or to bear a motto provided by the patron. It has been suggested, however, that the empty scroll is designed to demonstrate the superfluity of words in relation to images and thus refers to a contemporary humanist debate regarding the relative merits of poetry and art.\r During the course of its history, The Vision of Saint Eustace has been extensively repainted and retouched. Originally, the panel was taller (it has been cut at the top). The landscape has darkened because of the black underpaint and the use of malachite. The gold leaf in the tunic and harness has been regilded. Some animals, like the bear, have been entirely repainted. The saint\u2019s hat and face, however, are well preserved and the pastiglia (low gesso relief for decoration of some details), present in the harness, hunting horn and spurs, is original.\r The painting was bought by the National Gallery in 1895, catalogued as NG 1436, and is today on display in room 55.\r Dunkerton, Jill (1991).

It was probably executed between 1435 and 1449 and is also known as Portrait of a Princess of the House of Este. It is firmly attributed to Pisanello on stylistic grounds and because he stayed in Ferrara in the period, where he also finished a portrait and a celebrative medal of Marquis Leonello d'Este.\r The princess is shown in profile against a background of numerous butterflies and columbine flowers. The butterfly (it seems a Vanessa atalanta) near the princess' brow is a symbol of the soul.\r The painting is currently housed and exhibited in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in Paris, France.\r This picture first came to light in 1860 in a sale, when it was bought by the German Consul Felix Bamberg. In 1893 the Louvre acquired it from Charles Picard for 30000 francs.\r For a long time there has been no doubt in anyone's mind as to the name of the artist; but the identity of the sitter remains a mystery. The portrait represents a very young woman, hardly more than a girl. Against the background of greenery, with its sprinkling of butterflies, pinks and columbines, the profile is sharply defined. Her hair is styled to create the appearance of a high, round forehead, an attribute of beauty in Renaissance Italy. Women of this era frequently plucked their eyebrows, hairlines, and drew hair tightly away from the face to accentuate this quality. \r The only solid basis for a hypothesis of identification is the embroidery on her sleeve, representing the two-handled vase of the Este family; this is also found on the reverse of a medal which Pisanello designed for Lionello d'Este. Attempts have therefore been made to connect the portrait with various princesses of this family. Pisanello was one of the artists employed by them, and stayed on several occasions in Ferrara (Italy), where he decorated a room in the Palazzo Schifanoia.\r Margherita Gonzaga (d. 1439) might be one possibility for the sitter. She was the wife of Lionello d'Este, and the picture might have been painted at the time of their marriage in 1433. Another suggestion identifies this fresh and young face as Ginevra d'Este, because of the sprig of juniper on the sleeve - though this may simply be an emblem of happiness and not a pun on her name. She was the unfortunate niece and wife of the redoubtable Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, who subjected Romagna to fire and arms, and whose shameless affaire with Isotta degli Atti was the scandal of the age. It was Malatesta who commissioned polymath Leon Battista Alberti to build the Tempio Malatestiano at Rimini. He had his wife poisoned in 1440, when she was only twenty-two. It has also been suggested that the lady in the portrait may be a Gonzaga princess: perhaps Beatrice, or Margherita, or the learned Cecilia, whom Pisanello also depicted on a medal (cf. image at right).\n", "\nArtist: Paolo Uccello\nArtwork Name: The Hunt in the Forest\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-uccello/the-hunt-in-the-forest\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Hunt in the Forest (also known as The Hunt by Night or simply The Hunt) is a painting by the Italian artist Paolo Uccello, made around 1470.

It had allegedly been hidden there before the Second World War to prevent the occupying German army from removing it from the chapel. It is probably the first original work by Masaccio. It was commissioned by the Florentine family of Castellani for the Basilica of San Lorenzo, and was later moved to San Giovenale.\r It is dated at the bottom in modern humanist letters, the first work in Europe not inscribed in Gothic characters, which read, \"ANNO DOMINI MCCCCXXII A DI VENTITRE D'AP[RILE]\" (April 23, 1422).

The painting is in a very damaged state, the altarpiece having been cut up and sold in pieces long ago. Today the panel is smaller than its original state; it has lost perhaps as much as 8\u00a0cm. at the bottom and 2-2.5\u00a0cm. at each side. Eleven surviving panels of the altarpiece, which is the only documented work by Masaccio, are in various museums. Scholars hypothesize the reconstruction of the altarpiece based on a very complete description by Vasari.\r The painting contains six figures: the Madonna and Child and four angels. The Madonna is the centre figure and is larger than any of the others to signify her importance. Christ sits on her knees, eating grapes offered to him by his mother. Although he is an exceedingly babyish baby (in comparison to the babies of Masaccio's immediate predecessors, like Lorenzo Monaco or Gentile da Fabriano), the grapes are a symbol of his blood \u2013 like the red wine of Communion \u2013 which indicates Christ's awareness of his eventual death. The Madonna looks sorrowfully at her child, as she also realises his fate.\r Originally a panel of the Crucifixion stood above this painting, underlining the sacrificial (Eucharistic) nature of the image. In many ways the style of the painting is traditional; the expensive gold background and ultramarine draperies of the Virgin, her enlarged scale, and her hierarchical presentation (ceremoniously enthroned) all fit within the late-medieval formulas for the representation of Mary and Jesus in glory. In other ways, however, the painting is a step away from International Gothic in the sense that Masaccio has created a more realistic approach to the subject:\r Masaccio has used linear perspective to create pictorial space; it can be seen on the orthogonal on the cornice of her throne. The vanishing point is at the child's foot. The reason for this is that the work was originally located above a representation of the Adoration of the Magi, in which one of the magi kisses Jesus' foot.\r Although the paintings are noticeably different (the subjects are clothed differently and on different chairs) the Madonna is more or less in the same position in both works. This parallelism is designed to make viewers have the same attitude as the magus when looking at the Madonna and Child. They are imagined to be kneeling in front of Mary, and could easily lean forward to kiss the foot of Jesus.\r Masaccio has also used the overlapping of figures and objects to create pictorial space, like the two angels in the foreground overlapping the throne and the throne overlapping the two angels in the background.\n", "\nArtist: Masaccio\nArtwork Name: St. Paul\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/masaccio/st-paul-1426\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Paul is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Masaccio.

It is located in the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella, in Florence.  The Trinity is thought to have been created by Masaccio sometime between 1425-1427.  He died in late 1428 at the age of 26, or having just turned 27, leaving behind a relatively small body of work.  This painting was one of his last major commissions, and is considered to be one of his masterpieces.   The fresco is located along the middle of the basilica's left aisle.  Although the configuration of this space has changed since the artwork was created, there are clear indications that the fresco was aligned very precisely in relationship with the sight-lines and perspective arrangement of the room at the time; particularly a former entrance-way facing the painting; in order to enhance the tromp l'oeil effect. There was also an altar, mounted as a shelf-ledge between the upper and lower sections of the fresco, further emphasizing the \"reality\" of the artifice.  Not much is known about the details of the commission; no contemporaneous documents naming the altar-piece's patron(s) have been found.  The two donor portraits included in the fresco, one figure kneeling on either side of the archway, have not been positively identified.  The persons depicted are almost certainly contemporary Florentines; either the persons who funded the work, or relatives or close associates.  According to the established conventions of such depictions, it is generally, but not universally, assumed that they were probably still alive at the time of the artwork's commissioning.  Presumably, the representations in the painting serve as relatively accurate likenesses of their actual appearance at the time when their portraits were created.  The leading theories as to their identity favour two local families; either the Lenzi or, for at least one of the figures, a member of the Berti, who were a working-class family from the Santa Maria Novella quarter of Florence.  According to recently discovered (as of 2012) records of the Berti family, they owned a tomb at the foot of the fresco, and it has been suggested that they might have had a particular \"devotional loyalty\" to veneration of the Holy Trinity.  Other sources mention a Lenzi tomb near the altar, with the inscription \"Domenico di Lenzo, et Suorum 1426\", as well as other Lenzi decorations in the chapel at that time, and assume the donor portraits to be posthumous images of Domenico (and his spouse?); based on the full-profile pose used for the figures.  In the Florentine dating system of that time, the new year began on March 25; and factoring in the conversion from Julian to Gregorian calendars Domenico's death, as recorded, would have been on 19 January 1427.  It has been hypothesized that Fra' Alessio Strozzi and/or Filippo Brunelleschi may have been involved, or at least consulted, in the creation of Trinity.  Brunelleschi's work on linear perspective and architecture certainly inspired the painting, and this is clearly demonstrated within Massacio's work.  Fra' Alessio's involvement has been posited more on the matter of the appropriate depiction of the Holy Trinity, according to the preferences and sensibilities of the Dominican order.  However, there is, to date, no concrete evidence for the direct involvement of either of these 2 persons, and due to the lack of documentation about the exact circumstances of the piece's creation, theories about 3rd party involvement in the creative process remain speculative.\n", "\nArtist: Filippo Lippi\nArtwork Name: Adoration of the Magi\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/filippo-lippi/adoration-of-the-magi\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Adoration of the Magi is a tondo, or circular painting, of the Adoration of the Magi assumed to be that recorded in 1492 in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence as by Fra Angelico. It dates from the mid-15th century and is now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. Most art historians think that Filippo Lippi painted more of the original work, and that it was added to some years after by other artists, as well as including work by assistants in the workshops of both the original masters.

The National Gallery of Art dates it to \"c. 1440/1460\".\r Art historians are agreed that the painting was produced over a considerable period, with significant changes in the composition, and contributions from a number of hands.

Only the first of these is looking at Jesus and Mary, from an oblique angle almost behind them. Of the other two, the kneeling one points in the direction of the manger, well behind the sacred figures. The manger is placed outside the stable, and the ox and ass are also in the open air. The interior of the stable is occupied by what are presumably the Magi's horses and their grooms, removing their tack and in one case checking a horseshoe.\r Behind the magi on the left a large procession of their retinues continue to arrive, passing through an arch that is part of a large ruined structure. To the right of the main group the city walls of Bethlehem run up a steep slope, with a road or path running in front of the walls. Down this another large group, presumably more of the Magis' parties, is coming, riding on camels and horses. A number of townsfolk have come out through a gateway in the walls, and are looking and pointing, in one case kneeling in prayer, but all looking in a different direction from the final location of the main figures.

There are several paintings by Lippi of this same name.\r This piece is about six feet by six feet. There is little known information about the painting's origin, although it is likely that it was originally commissioned for use in its current location. The dating (c. 1440) is based on the style and the presence of St. Nicholas in the predella panels. The patron for this piece was notably Niccol\u00f2 Martelli, a rich Florentine citizen who supported the reconstruction of the basilica and other parts of town.\r The painting is considered the first known example of a squared altarpiece, without any traditional gothic decoration like pinnacles or cusps, in order to better match the simple architecture of the church, by Brunelleschi.\r The panel is divided in two by a central column. It uses a geometrical perspective to show a complex architecture including several edifices and an open loggia. There are several elements suggesting the influence of Flemish painting, by which Lippi was influenced during his stay in Padua. These include the glass ampulla in the foreground, symbolizing the Holy Spirit.\r In this piece there are three angels with wings who have come to meet with Mary. Gabriel is in front of two other angels kneeling while they stand. He is holding a long branch with some leaves at its tip; this may be an olive branch, which usually has the biblical significance of a peace offering. However, being paired with the dove flying above, it can be more seen as a symbol of freedom.\r The other two angels are looking off into the distance and not at Mary. The one closest to the audience is looking directly at us, as if acknowledging our presence. They wear woven red socks which are a similar color to their outer garments. Under this red drape they wear light grey outfits tied around their waists by a rope. Mary is wearing a darker grey garment with gold outlining and a light-colored headwear. She is looking down at Gabriel and motioning her hand toward him. She might be reaching her hand out to receive the branch from him, though he doesn't appear to be extending it out to her. There is an object to the right of her which appears to be a placeholder for books or other text.\r They all have golden halos above their heads with teardrop-like patterns inside. These don't seem to be floating, but rather just placed on their heads somehow, without obeying laws of gravity. Their robes are all shown with very exaggerated drapery and wrinkles, which gives this piece depth and adds movement to the figures. This is a style of painting clothing that was popular during this era of the Renaissance.\r The architecture painted displays a very classic Italian Renaissance style. There are two arches on either side of the subjects, and we look in through the arches to see the scene. Behind the figures there seems to be a garden of small trees and one which is almost as tall as the buildings surrounding it. This tree is positioned in line with Gabriel, who is standing directly in front of it. This may have been used to signify his importance and to make him a main subject, separating him from the other angels. The whole courtyard exhibits symmetry in the rows of trees and buildings that are on either side. The cityscape continues on in the background with churches and tall buildings poking above the skyline. The churches can be noticed by their pointed tower tops which stand taller than the other buildings.\n", "\nArtist: Filippo Lippi\nArtwork Name: Coronation of the Virgin\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: tempera,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/filippo-lippi/coronation-of-the-virgin-1445\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Marsuppini Coronation is a painting of the Coronation of the Virgin by the Italian Renaissance painter Filippo Lippi, dating to after 1444. It is in the Pinacoteca Vaticana, Rome.\r The panel was commissioned by the chancellor of the Republic of Florence, Carlo Marsuppini, for the St. Bernard Chapel in the eponymous church at Arezzo. His father Gregorio, to whom it would be dedicated, had died in 1444, and thus the work must date to that year or later, up to c. 1460.\r The work remained in Arezzo until 1785, when the monastery which owned the church was suppressed. It was subsequently split into three parts and sold to privates, and was later acquired by Pope Gregory XVI.

There are no shepherds, kings, ox, ass \u2013 there is no Joseph. \"Lippi removes a whole range of narrative details which would have been present in a standard Nativity - he creates a whole set of mysteries, and then preserves them.\" It was painted for one of the wealthiest men in Renaissance Florence, the banker Cosimo de Medici. In later times it had a turbulent history. Hitler ordered it to be hidden in WW2 and it became part of the story of a mutiny in the U.S. Army - 'the only known case in the whole Second World War of American officers refusing an order.' It is now once again in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin.\r Florence in the 1440s was at an expansive moment in its history. A lot of money was going into building, including the future home of Lippi's Adoration, Cosimo de Medici's Palazzo Medici. Cosimo was the wealthiest man in Florence, a man of power, an adept Italian politician and his home spoke of an attitude of powerful confidence. Yet, in private, he was also a troubled man. He had led a sinful life, had fathered a bastard child on a slave girl, and grown rich by lending money and charging interest \u2013 usury \u2013 a practice to be punished by an eternity in Hell. Tim Parks: \" He was a genuinely religious man, concerned about his soul, and that was a rather large problem for a banker.\" He set about making amends for his sins in building and art. \"Inside his new palace, the first domestic chapel built in all of Italy, as a peace offering to God; a place for Cosimo to kneel and do penance. The walls were decorated with extravagant frescoes, including a portrait of Cosimo himself. But the heart of the room would be the altarpiece - this would be a Nativity, but of a kind never seen before, one that would echo Cosimo's very deepest hopes and fears. \" He chose an artist famous not just for his art, but one whose eye for beauty extended beyond pictures, to women, with scandalous results; - a Carmelite friar - Fra Filippo Lippi. Born in Florence around 1406, Lippi's father was a butcher, and the family home on the south bank of the Arno River. By the age of 8 Lippi was an orphan, and placed into the care of the local convent, Santa Maria del Carmine, which towered over the neighbourhood. So Lippi had not chosen to become a monk, but was to be trained to be one. It was a fortunate home for a youngster of an artistic bent; in the 1420s a chapel there was being decorated - 'and the result was one of the most groundbreaking and beautiful works of the Italian Renaissance.\n", "\nArtist: Filippo Lippi\nArtwork Name: Funeral of St. Jerome\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/filippo-lippi/funeral-of-st-jerome-1465\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Funeral of St. Jerome is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Filippo Lippi of Saint Jerome's funeral. It is housed in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo next to the Cathedral of Prato, central Italy.\r The large altarpiece was commissioned by the provost of Prato, Geminiano Inghirami, a patron of the arts who also called Donatello and Michelozzo to work in the cathedral. The panel is dated 1440, but this has been always considered a false due to the large stylistic differences with other Lippi's works of the period. It is generally recognized to be from between 1452, when Lippi arrived in Prato (or a few years before), and Inghirami's death in 1460.\r It is housed in the cathedral's museum since the 20th century.\r The work features numerous characters, painted in different attitudes. In the center, lying on a catafalque with a precious cloth decorated with pomegranates, is the body of St. Jerome. He is surrounded by a group of monks, whose faces show their mourning and despair for the saint's death. The pomegranate cloth is also visible in the funerary monument of Geminiano Inghirami, once in the church of San Francesco, attributed to Pasquino da Montepulciano (1460).\r The mourner's faces show that Lippi had studied Giotto's work in the Bardi Chapel, as some gestures are very similar, such as that of the monks kissing the saint's feet or the one raising his hands. Also the saint's position is similar to Giotto's, as well as the presence of ancient numismatic, a widespread theme at the time.\r In the foreground is Inghirami kneeling, with a crippled youth in front of him who points at Jerome's body (a trick to avoid that the donor's red garments could distract the observer). The crippled figure is inspired by the frescoes by Masaccio and Masolino da Panicale in the Brancacci Chapel, which Lippi knew well as he had a been a monk in the convent housing the chapel in his youth.\r The upper part of the panel, aside from rocky mountains with three secondary scenes (Adoration of the Child and two episodes of the saint's life), is occupied by angels, perhaps executed by Fra' Diamante or another collaborator. Among them circles which allude to the Heaven's Circles, the Redeemer (with a book with Alpha and Omega), the Holy Spirit dove and the Jesus opening his arms.\r At the bottom is the coat of arms of the Inghirami family.\n", "\nArtist: Filippo Lippi\nArtwork Name: Madonna and Child\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/filippo-lippi/madonna-and-child\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna of Palazzo Medici-Riccardi is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Filippo Lippi.

There are several theories about the provenance of the panel: Poggi assigned it to the Villa of Castelpulci, owned by the Riccardi family, who bought Palazzo Medici in 1655. According to another, the Madonna was instead part of the original decoration of the palace.\r After having been acquired by the Italian state, it was moved to Palazzo Medici-Riccardi, where now is displayed in the Hall of the Triumphs and Arts in the first floor, near the gallery of Luca Giordano. It has been restored in 2001 by the Opificio delle Pietre Dure.\r The model of the painting had been used by Lippi since as early as 1436: it portrays the Madonna's half-bust in a niche with a shell-shaped dome, holding the Child; in this case, he stands on a marble parapet. The style is however typical of his late career, not far from the frescoes in the Cathedral of Spoleto, and is thus generally considered one of the artists' last panels.\r The rear of the panel has a drawing with St. Jerome's head.\n", "\nArtist: Domenico Veneziano\nArtwork Name: Madonna and Child with St. Lucy, St. Francis, St. Nicolas and St. John the Baptist, from Santa Lucia dei Magnoli\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/domenico-veneziano/madonna-and-child-with-st-lucy-st-francis-st-nicolas-and-st-john-the-baptist-from-santa-lucia\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Santa Lucia de' Magnoli Altarpiece (Italian: Pala di Santa Lucia de' Magnoli) is a painting by the Italian painter Domenico Veneziano, dated to around 1445\u20131447.

The large panel had originally a predella, which has been divided between museums in Washington, Berlin and Cambridge.\r It has been described as \"almost certainly ... the first true sacra conversazione\", or painting of the Virgin and Child with saints on a unified scale and sharing the same space.\r The painting is one of the earliest known examples of tabula quadrata et sine civoriis as suggested by Brunelleschi, which meant a \"modern\" type of painting without the inner frames and the gilded background which was typical of earlier painting. The setting is however reminiscent of the frames, with three ogival arches, the columns and the shell-shaped niches. The polychrome floor, and the architecture, including the base of the Madonna's throne, is depicted with the use of geometrical perspective, an innovation introduced in Italian early Renaissance art.\r The saints portrayed are St. John the Baptist and St. Zenobius (patron saints of Florence), St. Lucy (titular of the church where the painting was situated) and St. Francis, who resided in the church at his arrival in Florence in 1211. The garments and the mitre of St. Zenobius are particularly rich, with precious stones, pearls, golden plaques and enamels.\r The predella included panels with scenes of the saints of the main composition, and a central, double-size Annunciation: the Stygmata of St. Francis and John Baptist in the Desert are currently in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the Annunciation and The Miracle of St. Zenobius are in the Fitzwilliam Museum of Cambridge, and the Martyrdom of St. Lucy is in the Berlin State Museums.\n", "\nArtist: Piero della Francesca\nArtwork Name: Baptism of Christ\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/piero-della-francesca/baptism-of-christ-1450\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Baptism of Christ is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Piero della Francesca, finished around 1448\u201350. It is housed in the National Gallery, London.\r The panel was commissioned presumably some time about 1440 by the Camaldolese Monastery of Sansepolcro in Tuscany, originally part of a triptych. Its dating to Piero della Francesca's early career is evidenced by the strong relationship with the \"light painting\" of his master, Domenico Veneziano.\r It portrays Christ being baptised by John, his head surmounted by a dove representing the Holy Spirit. Christ, John's hand, the bird and the bowl form an axis which divides the painting in two symmetrical parts. A second division is created by the tree on the left, which instead divides it according to the golden ratio.\r Behind John, a man in white briefs, his feet already in the water, is struggling to get out of his undershirt. The three angels on the left wear different clothes and, in a break from traditional iconography, are not supporting Christ's garments, but are holding each other's hands, in a sort of way. This could be an allusion to the contemporary Council of Florence (1431\u201345), whose goal was the unification of the Western and Eastern Churches. The Camaldolese monk and theologian, Saint Ambrose Traversari (+1439), who had been Prior General of the Camaladolese congregation, had been a strong supporter of the union. Such symbolism is also suggested by the presence, behind the neophyte on the right, of figures dressed in an oriental fashion.\r Piero della Francesca was renowned in his times as an authority on perspective and geometry: his attention to the theme is shown by John's arm and leg, which form two angles of the same size.\n", "\nArtist: Piero della Francesca\nArtwork Name: The Flagellation of Christ\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/piero-della-francesca/the-flagellation-of-christ-1450-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Flagellation of Christ (probably 1455\u20131460) is a painting by Piero della Francesca in the Galleria Nazionale delle Marche in Urbino, Italy. Called by one writer an \"enigmatic little painting,\" the composition is complex and unusual, and its iconography has been the subject of widely differing theories. Kenneth Clark placed The Flagellation in his personal list of the best ten paintings, calling it \"the greatest small painting in the world\".\r The theme of the picture is the Flagellation of Christ by the Romans during his Passion. The biblical event takes place in an open gallery in the middle distance, while three figures in the foreground on the right-hand side apparently pay no attention to the event unfolding behind them. The panel is much admired for its use of linear perspective and the air of stillness that pervades the work, and it has been given the epithet \"the Greatest Small Painting in the World\" by the art historian Kenneth Clark.\r The painting is signed under the seated emperor OPVS PETRI DE BVRGO S[AN]C[T]I SEPVLCRI \u2013 \"the work of Piero of Borgo Santo Sepolcro\" (his native town).\r The Flagellation is particularly admired for the realistic rendering of the hall in which the flagellation scene is situated in relation to the size of the figures and for the geometrical order of the composition. The portrait of the bearded man at the front is considered unusually intense for Piero's time.\r Much of the scholarly debate surrounding the work concerns the identities or significance of the three men at the front. Depending on the interpretation of the subject of the painting, they may represent contemporary figures or people related to the passion of Christ, or they may even have multiple identities. The latter is also suggested with respect to the sitting man on the left, who is in one sense certainly Pontius Pilate, a traditional element in the subject. The notion of two time frames in the composition is derived from the fact that the flagellation scene is illuminated from the right while the supposedly \"modern\" outdoor scene is illuminated from the left. Originally the painting had a frame on which the Latin phrase \"Convenerunt in Unum\" (\"They came together\"), taken from Psalm 2, ii in the Old Testament, was inscribed. This text is cited in Book of Acts 4:26 and related to Pilate, Herod and the Jews.\r According to a conventional interpretation still upheld in Urbino, the three men would be Oddantonio da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino between his advisors, Manfredo dei Pio and Tommaso di Guido dell'Agnello, who were murdered together on July 22, 1444. Both advisers were held responsible for Oddantonio's death due to their unpopular government, which led to the fatal conspiracy. Oddantonio's death would be compared, in its innocence, to that of Christ. The painting would then have been commissioned by Federico da Montefeltro, who succeeded his half brother Oddantonio as Lord of Urbino. According to another interpretation, the two men to the left and right of the youth would represent Serafini and Ricciarelli, both citizens of Urbino, who allegedly murdered Oddantonio together with his two bad advisors. Against these interpretations speaks the written contract signed by Federico and the citizens of Urbino, \u00b4that he would not bear in remembrance the offenses inflicted on Oddantonio, that no one would be punished for it and that Federico would protect all who may be compromised in these crimes\u00b4. Moreover, Oddantonio's corpse was buried in an unnamed grave. A painting dedicated to the memory of Duke Oddantonio and to his rehabilitation would thus have been a case of betrayal to the citizens of Urbino.\n", "\nArtist: Piero della Francesca\nArtwork Name: Sigismondo Malatesta\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/piero-della-francesca/sigismondo-malatesta-1451\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Piero della Francesca (c. 1451).

Piero was commissioned to paint the fresco for the Gothic-style Residenza, the communal meeting hall which was used solely by Conservatori, the chief magistrates and governors, who before starting their councils, would pray before the image. \"The secular and spiritual meanings of the painting were always intimately intertwined.\" Placed high on the interior wall facing the entrance, the fresco has for its subject an allusion to the name of the city (meaning \"Holy Sepulchre\"), derived from the presence of two relics of the Holy Sepulchre carried by two pilgrims in the 9th century. Piero's Christ is also present on the town's Coat of Arms.  Jesus is in the centre of the composition, portrayed in the moment of his resurrection, as suggested by the position of the leg on the parapet of his tomb, which Piero renders as a classical sarcophagus. His stern, impassive figure, depicted in an iconic and abstract fixity (and described by Aldous Huxley as \"athletic\"), rises over four sleeping soldiers, representing the difference between the human and the divine spheres (or the death, defeated by Christ's light). His figure in the commune's council hall \"both protects the judge and purifies the judged\" according to Marilyn Aronberg Lavin. The landscape, immersed in the dawn light, has also a symbolic value: the contrast between the flourishing young trees on the right and the bare mature ones on the left alludes to the renovation of men through the Resurrection's light. Andrew Graham-Dixon notes that apart from the wound, Christ's \"body is as perfectly sculpted and as blemish-free as that of an antique statue. But there are touches of intense humanity about him too: the unidealised, almost coarse-featured face; and those three folds of skin that wrinkle at his belly as he raises his left leg. Piero emphasises his twofold nature, as both man and God.\"  The guard holding the lance is depicted sitting in an anatomically impossible pose, and appears to have no legs. Piero probably left them out so as not to break the balance of the composition.  According to tradition and by comparison with the woodcut illustrating Vasari's Lives of the Painters, the sleeping soldier in brown armor on Christ's right is a self-portrait of Piero. The contact between the soldier's head and the pole of the banner carried by Christ is supposed to represent his contact with the divinity.  The composition is unusual in that it contains two vanishing points. One is in the center of the sarcophagus, because the faces of the guards are seen from below, and the other is in Jesus's face. The top of the sarcophagus forms a boundary between the two points of view, and the steepness of the hills prevents the transition between the two points of view from being too jarring.  Sansepolcro was spared much damage during World War 2 when British artillery officer Tony Clarke defied orders and held back from using his troop's guns to shell the town.  Although Clarke had never seen the fresco, his diary records his shock at the destruction in Monte Cassino and, apparently remembering where he had read of Sansepolcro, ordered his men to hold fire just as methodical shelling had begun. Clarke had read Huxley's 1925 essay describing the Resurrection, which states: \"It stands there before us in entire and actual splendour, the greatest picture in the world.\" It was later ascertained that the Germans had already retreated from the area \u2014 the bombardment had not been necessary, though Clarke had not known this when he ordered the shelling stopped. The town, along with its famous painting, survived. When the events of the episode eventually became clear, Clarke was lauded as a local hero and to this day a street in Sansepolcro bears his name.\n", "\nArtist: Piero della Francesca\nArtwork Name: Portraits Federico da Montefeltro and Battista Sforza\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/piero-della-francesca/portraits-federico-da-montefeltro-and-battista-sforza-1465\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe double portrait of the Dukes of Urbino, also known as the Diptych of Federico da Montefeltro and Battista Sforza is a diptych, oil on panel (47 \u00d7 33\u00a0cm each panel), with portraits of the Federico da Montefeltro and Battista Sforza.

It is housed in the Pinacoteca di Brera of Milan, where it was deposited by Napoleon.\r The work, of a type known as a sacra conversazione, was commissioned by Federico III da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, to celebrate the birth of Federico's son, Guidobaldo. According to other sources, it would celebrate his conquest of several castles in the Maremma.\r The painting was executed between 1472 and 1474; the terminus ante quem is established by the absence from Federico's figure of the insignia of the Order of the Garter, which he received in the latter year. When it was rediscovered at the Brera at the end of the 19th century, the painting was so disfigured by darkened varnish it was attributed to Fra Carnevale (Bartolomeo di Giovanni Corradini), as Piero's use of oil technique was not yet known.\r Some sources suggest that the work was commissioned to celebrate the birth of Federico's son, Guidobaldo, who was born in 1472. According to this hypothesis, the Child could represent Guidobaldo, while the Virgin may have the appearance of Battista Sforza, Federico's wife, who died in the same year and was buried at San Bernardino.\r The work represents a sacred conversation, with the Virgin enthroned and the sleeping Child in the middle, surrounded by a host of angels and saints. On the right low corner, kneeling and wearing his armor, the patron of arts, duke and condottiero Federico da Montefeltro. The background consists of the apse of a church in Renaissance classical style, which is rendered in such meticulous perspective that the feigned depth of the coffer-vaulted apse at the rear can be calculated. At the center, hanging by a thread from the apse shell is an egg, emblem alike of Mary's fecundity and the promise of regeneration and immortality.\r The Child wears a necklace of deep red coral beads, a color which alludes to blood, a symbol of life and death, but also to the redemption brought by Christ. Coral was also used for teething, and often worn by babies. The saints at the left of the Madonna are generally identified as John the Baptist, Bernardino of Siena (dedicatee of the paintings's original location) and Jerome; on the right would be Francis, Peter Martyr and Andrew. In the last figure, the Italian historian Ricci has identified a portrait of Luca Pacioli, a mathematician born in Sansepolcro like Piero della Francesca. The presence of John the Baptist would be explained as he was the patron saint of Federico's wife, while St. Jerome was the protector of Humanists. Francis, finally, would be present as the painting was originally thought for the Franciscan church of San Donato degli Osservanti, where Federico was later buried.\r Modern cleaning has revealed the great detail in characters' clothes, the angels' jewels, Federico's reflective armor and the oriental carpet beneath the feet of the Virgin, reflecting the influence of Early Netherlandish painting.\n", "\nArtist: Andrea del Castagno\nArtwork Name: David with the Head of Goliath\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: leather,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-castagno/david-with-the-head-of-goliath\n\nWikipedia Article:\nDavid with the Head of Goliath is a painting on leather and wood by artist Andrea del Castagno.\r It has dimensions 115.5 x 76.5 centimeters.

It is now housed in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice.  The painting was commissioned for the Grand Hall of the  Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista, the seat of the eponymous brotherhood in Venice. The commission included a total of nine large canvasses, by prominent artists of the time such as Bellini, Perugino, Vittore Carpaccio, Giovanni Mansueti, Lazzaro Bastiani and Benedetto Rusconi.   The subject of the paintings were to be the miracles of a fragment of the True Cross. The item had been donated to the brotherhood by Philippe de M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, chancellor of the Kingdom of Cyprus and Jerusalem in 1369, and soon became the object of veneration in the city.  The canvasses were all executed in 1496\u20131501.  The canvas shows an event that took place about 50 years earlier, on 25 April 1444: while the members of the Scuola were processing the fragment through the Piazza San Marco (the square of St. Mark's), Jacopo de' Salis, a tradesman from Brescia, knelt before the relic in prayer that his dying son might recover. When he returned home, he discovered that the boy was completely well again.   In the foreground, Gentile has painted the confraternity in its white robes, processing at the head of the parade, the large golden reliquary suspended between them, carried beneath a canopy held by four more Scuola members. Although the subject of the picture is ostensibly the miracle itself, the Brescian merchant is hardly visible in the crowd: he kneels in sumptuous red robes, immediately to the right of the last two canopy-bearers. Rather, the subject of the picture might be more accurately described as the procession, with an especial focus on the space of St. Mark's square and on St Mark's Basilica itself, with its Byzantine domes and glittering mosaics.\n", "\nArtist: Gentile Bellini\nArtwork Name: St. Mark Preaching in Alexandria\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gentile-bellini/st-mark-preaching-in-alexandria-1507\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSt. Mark Preaching in Alexandria is an oil painting by Gentile and Giovanni Bellini, dated to 1504\u201307 and held in the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan  The work is a huge canvas (telero) destined for the Scuola Grande di San Marco in Venice. It is 26m in surface, and has rich narrative and iconographic features. The cycle of paintings with stories of the life of St Mark was completed around 60 years later by Giorgione and Tintoretto, and is today housed in the Pinacoteca di Brera and the Accademia in Venice.  The canvas was started by Gentile in July 1504, but after his death in February 1507, when it was \"largely completed\", it passed to his brother Giovanni, as indicated in Gentile's will. Giovanni completed it, making some modifications. The invitation to complete it was probably from his brother just before he died, to which Giovanni probably responded negatively, This explains its insertion in the will of the clause that consigned a precious collection of drawing to Giovanni should he complete the painting. The commission was confirmed as being passed to Giovanni by the Scuola on 7 March 1507.  The scene is rich with exotic elements adapted from real-life that Gentile had the opportunity to study during his trip to Constantinople in 1479\u20131480. Decorative elements of Mamluk architecture, rather than Ottoman, suggest that the artist may also have reached Jerusalem.  It is not clear which parts were done by which brother: Vasari only mentioned Gentile in the 1550 version of the Vite, and omitting them in the 1568 edition. Modern criticism considers Gentile to have done the background, except for the modified parts, and possibly the characters on the right hand. Giovanni is assigned with some certainty the portraits on the left, and some of the central group.  The canvas was reduced at an unknown time, a strip along the top being cut away, where the buildings finished. The work arrived in the Brera in 1809, following the Napoleonic invasion.

It was commissioned for the convent annexed to the church of Santa Maria extra moenia in Messina, also called San Gregorio, whence its modern name. The panels were originally connected by a carved frame in Neo-Gothic style, which was likely removed from as early as the 16th century.\r The work is in poor state. One of the panel was removed in the 16th century or later, and in 1842 there was a drastic restoration of what remained. In 1908, the former convent where the work was destroyed by the 1908 Messina earthquake, leaving its art pieces exposed to the rain which fell in the following days. In that occasion, large parts of the Madonna's mantle and of St. Gregory went lost.\r Recovery interventions began in 1912, under the direction of Luigi Cavenaghi. This regarded, in particular, the side panels, including a restoration of lost parts basing on existing photographs (such as one of St. Gregory's hands). A new restoration was carried on in 1940-1942 by the Istituto Centrale del Restauro of Rome, followed by another (Angel of Annunciation panel) in 1981. In 2005-2006 there was a complete check of the polyptych, when it was exhibited at the Quirinal Palace. Some details, which had been covered by later repaintings and restorations, were recovered: they include the original decoration with vegetable motifs of Mary's mantle (originally completed by a gilt decoration, now lost).\r Five of the original panels in the polyptych, on two levels, survive. The lower level shows, at the center, the Madonna of the Rosary Enthroned, flanked by St. Gregory the Great at left and St. Benedict at right. The upper level depicts an Angel of Annunciation and the Annunciation, while a central panel, perhaps a Dead Christ Supported by Angels or a Deposition from the Cross, is lost.\r The general layout of the polyptych is rather traditional, such as the presence of gilt background. However, there is a series of more modern details which show Antonello's attention to novelties he saw or learn from the rest of Italy. These include the spatial unification of the panels (as in the steps at the base of the throne, which continue to the side panels), the use of tempera grassa derived from Netherlandish and Catalan artists working in the Kingdom of Naples, as well as the psychological characterization of the characters.\r The polyptych was likely placed on a side wall, as testified by the observation angle, which is from right, and the tapestry behind the throne, which is not at the center. The upper level is instead optimized for view from below. There are also trompe-l'oeil details, such as the saints' feet which apparently jut out from the step's edge, inspired by spatial innovations by northern Italian painters such as Andrea Mantegna. Also typical of northern European art was the attention to smaller details, including the pearls in Benedict's mitre, the brilliant cherries that the Child takes from his mother's wife, or the pearls in the rosary at the Virgin's feet.\n", "\nArtist: Antonello da Messina\nArtwork Name: Annunciation\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/antonello-da-messina/annunciation-1474\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Annunciation is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Antonello da Messina, executed in 1474.

In 1902 a document esplicitly attributing the work to Antonello was found.\r The painting, which was in a poor state of preservation, was restored in 2006.\r The scene is set in a small room with a decorated beamed ceiling, supported by two columns which separate the right half of the painting (with the Virgin) from the left one (with the Angel). The background wall has two windows, with a third in another room visible on the right, according to an iconography derived from the Flemish painting, using different light sources and spatial openings also in interiors.\r The objects and the furnitures, as usually in Antonello's works, are finely detailed.

It is in the collection of the National Gallery, London.\r The picture was painted by Antonello during his Venetian sojourn, and was the property of Antonio Pasqualino.\r The small picture portrays St. Jerome working in his studio, a room without walls and ceiling seen from a kind of triumphal arch (probably within some church of Aragonese style). As in several other works by the Messinese painter, the main scene is accompanied by a host of details, that have points of contact with the contemporary Flemish school: books, animals, objects, all painted with a magnificent taste for detail and \"optical truth\".\r The scene is devised such that the light rays coincide with the perspective axes, centering on the saint's bust and hands. A Mediterranean landscape is hinted at through the windows opening on both sides of the study. Animals include a partridge (alectoris graeca) and a peacock, in the foreground, both having symbolical meanings, a cat and a lion, typically associated with St Jerome, in the shade on the right.\r Antonello uses many symbols throughout the painting. The book St. Jerome is reading represents knowledge. The books surrounding him refer to his translation of the Bible into Latin, the Vulgate. The lion in the shadows to the right of the saint is from a story about St. Jerome pulling a thorn out of a lion's paws. In gratitude, the lion follows St. Jerome around for the rest of his life, like a house cat. The peacock and partridge play no specific part in the story of St. Jerome. However, the peacock generally symbolizes immortality, and the partridge is an ambivalent reference to truth/deceit.\n", "\nArtist: Antonello da Messina\nArtwork Name: St. Sebastian\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/antonello-da-messina/st-sebastian-1477\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSt. Sebastian is a painting, once part of a triptych by the Italian Renaissance artist Antonello da Messina, completed in 1477-9. It is housed in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden, Germany.\r The visit of the Sicilian artist Antonello da Messina to Venice in 1475\u20136 has traditionally been seen as turning point in the history of the city's painting \u2013 Giorgio Vasari crediting him with introducing oil painting to Venice. Antonello painted two altarpieces for Venetian churches, one for the church of San Cassiano, and the other, of which the St Sebastian once formed part, for the altar of the Scuola di San Rocca in the parish church of San Giuliano. It has often been assumed to have been painted in Venice in 1476, but it may have been painted only after Antonella's return to Sicily in the autumn of that year. A description by Francesco Sansovino, dating from 1581, indicates that the altarpiece consisted of a wooden statue of St Roche, flanked by painted panels showing St Christopher and St Sebastian. Sansovino describes the panel of St Christopher as being by Antonello, and that of St Sebastian as being by \"Pino da Messina\" (i.e. his son Jacobello or \"Jacopino\"). However art historians have generally accepted Antonello's authorship of the St Sebastian. The statue and the painting of St Christopher are now lost.\r This picture, dominated by the vertical figure of the saint, shows a marked influence by Piero della Francesca: this can be seen in particular in the perspective of the floor and in the \"mathematical\" disposition of the figurative elements. Original to Antonello is the smooth rendering of the body of St. Sebastian (defying any geometrical break-down) and the passion for the details of landscape, seen for example in Umbrian school painters like Carlo Crivelli.\r Famous details include the man reclining on the left, the typical Venetian-style chimneys, the columns and the monumental appearance of the buildings (probably inspired by some of Mantegna's works) and the debating pairs of men on the right side, forming an interesting mixing of late Gothic elements with Venetian, Flemish and advanced Renaissance ones.\n", "\nArtist: Giovanni Bellini\nArtwork Name: Madonna with Child\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: tempera,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/giovanni-bellini/madonna-with-child-1455\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna and Child is an early tempera on panel painting usually attributed to Giovanni Bellini, dated to 1450-1460 or to 1450-1455 by Pignatti, though Olivari and others consider this to be too early. In the 1450s the painter was still heavily influenced by his father Jacopo and by Bartolomeo Vivarini. The strong line used for the Christ Child also shows the influence of Francesco Squarcione and his studio on the young Bellini. The general composition is based on a widely-copied Byzantine icon in Venice, whilst the Christ Child holds a Flemish-style scroll bearing the artist's signature.

In the front is Saint Joseph, which, according to some scholars, would be a portrait of Bellini's father, Jacopo. On the sides the painter added two further figures, which make the picture rather crowded.

It is in the Frick Collection in New York City, displayed prominently in what was the living room of Henry Clay Frick, an American industrialist, financier, and art patron. The painting is oil on panel and shows the influence of Andrea Mantegna, who was the painter's brother-in-law. It is signed IOANNES BELLINVS on a small, creased tag visible in the lower left corner. The painting is now in the Frick Collection and it is considered to be one of its finest assets.\r The painting portrays the Italian 12th-century saint Francis of Assisi in an Italian landscape, stepping out in the sun from his cave. Francis lived under poor conditions in the beginning of his sainthood and used to participate in isolated spiritual retreats at monasteries but this painting is most probably a symbolic representation of the saint. The animals in the picture may represent the saint's love for nature and animals. The Ecstasy of St. Francis is depicting Francis in a religious ecstasy, perhaps receiving the stigmata, as Millard Meiss suggested though, when Francis is receiving the sigmata, usually an angel, a seraph or a crucifix emitting rays is depicted as well. Alternatively, he may be praying or perhaps singing his Canticle of the Sun, as Richard Turner has argued.\r Whatever the specific moment portrayed may be, the representation is a fresh one and does not follow any of the established iconographic motifs.\r In the left middle-ground is a donkey which can be interpreted as a symbol of humility and patience. In the lower right corner, on a rustic reading table, is a skull, representing mortality, welcomed in the last stanza of the saint's Canticle. The cave may relate Francis to Saint Jerome, who also lived in a cave or cell. The stream in the left middle-ground symbolizes Moses and the great spring, while the barren tree in the centre of the painting represents the Burning Bush. The saint has left his wooden pattens behind and stands barefoot like Moses. In the distance rises the still-empty Heavenly Jerusalem. The overall composition is thought to be a meditation of St. Francis on the creation of the world as related in the Book of Genesis.

It is in the Uffizi gallery in Florence, Italy.\r There is no documentation about the commission and the original location of the work, which is known to have been part of the Austrian Imperial collections in Vienna in the 18th century. In 1793 the director of the Uffizi, Luigi Lanzi, exchanged it with another work in order to improve the Venetian Renaissance presence in the museum. At the time, it was attributed to Giorgione.\r The Italian art historian Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle was the first to identify it as a Bellini. Today his attribution is widely recognized, although another name sometimes mentioned is that of Marco Basaiti.\r The scene is set on a wide terrace with a polychrome marble pavement, in perspective, separated from a lake shore by a parapet. On the left Mary is enthroned, under a baldachin whose support is in cornucopia shape, a symbol of her fertility. The baldachin has four steps, and on its side is a frieze with scenes of the myth of Marsyas, interpreted as a parallel with Jesus' Passion. Near to Mary are two unidentified female figures, which could represent two saints or two virtues. One of them looks to be floating in the air, although the effect could stem from a loss of color near her legs and feet.\r In the middle of the scene are four children playing with a small tree and its silver fruits, perhaps a symbol of the knowledge tree, a symbol of life and wisdom. On the right are Job and St. Sebastian. Outside the parapet, are St. Joseph (or St. Peter) and St. Paul, the latter with his attribute of a sword. He is advancing to the left, where a man with a turban perhaps symbolizes an infidel.\r In the background, beyond a large lake, is a landscape with rocky spurs with men and animals. On the shores are a shepherd in a grotto, and a centaur.\r The exact meaning of the painting had not been yet completely understood, although several hypotheses have been made by art historians. What is sure is that the painting was made for a refined \u00e9lite, whose education allowed them to understand any subtle detail included in it.\r In the early 20th century, Ludwig interpreted it as a pictoral transcription of the early 14th French poem Le P\u00e8lerinage de l'\u00c2me (\"Pilgrimage of the Soul\"), by Guillaume de Deguileville. According to him, the painting represents the ideal path of purification of the soul. The hermit shepherd would be St. Anthony the Abbot, descending from his hermitage in the spiritual path inspired to the first hermit, St. Paul, and overcoming several obstacles including the centaur which waits for him at the end of the staircase. The terrace would represent the Paradise Garden, where the souls in Purgatory, symbolized by the children, wait before they are admitted to heaven. Mary, advocate of the men before God, judges the souls with the help of the crowned Justice coronata. Amongst the children, who are playing with the mystic fruits, the one at the tree would be a soul called to the eternal beatitude. The two saints standing on the left would be the patrons, perhaps connected to the works' commissioners, while the two behind the parapet would be Peter and Paul, who guard the gate of Paradise. The river in the background would be Lethe, which surrounds Paradise. The animals would represent the hermits' virtue: the mule for the patience, and the sheep for humility.\n", "\nArtist: Giovanni Bellini\nArtwork Name: Leonardo Loredan\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/giovanni-bellini/leonardo-loredan-1501-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Doge Leonardo Loredan is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Giovanni Bellini, dating from 1501. It is on display in the National Gallery in London. It portrays Leonardo Loredan, Doge of Venice from 1501 to 1521, in his ceremonial garments with the corno worn over a linen cap, and is signed IOANNES BELLINVS on a cartellino.\r Leonardo Loredan was the Doge of Venice from 1501\u201321. In Bellini's painting he is shown wearing his robes of state. The hat and ornate buttons are part of his official wardrobe. The sitter can be identified as Doge Loredan by comparing his features with portrait medals of him. The shape of the hat comes from the hood of a doublet. It is called a corno ducale and was a type of ducal hat, worn over a linen cap. The painting is part of a Venetian tradition of painting formal portraits of the City's rulers dressed in state robes. It is painted in the style of the sculpted portrait busts popular at the time. These were often inspired by Roman sculpture. Bellini signed his name in its Latin form, IOANNES BELLINVS on the cartellino, or \"small paper\", on the parapet. He was famous for his portraiture and helped make this art form especially popular in Venice.\r John Pope-Hennessy described Bellini as \"by far the greatest fifteenth-century official portraitist\", adding that \"the tendency towards ideality that impairs his private portraits here stood him in good stead, and enabled him to codify, with unwavering conviction, the official personality\".\r The painting would initially have been in Venice and was probably looted when Napoleon conquered the city. It was bought by William Thomas Beckford in 1807 for thirteen guineas (\u00a313 13s). He sold it to the National Gallery in 1844 for \u00a3630.\n", "\nArtist: Giovanni Bellini\nArtwork Name: St. Mark Preaching in Alexandria\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/giovanni-bellini/st-mark-preaching-in-alexandria-1507\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSt. Mark Preaching in Alexandria is an oil painting by Gentile and Giovanni Bellini, dated to 1504\u201307 and held in the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan  The work is a huge canvas (telero) destined for the Scuola Grande di San Marco in Venice. It is 26m in surface, and has rich narrative and iconographic features. The cycle of paintings with stories of the life of St Mark was completed around 60 years later by Giorgione and Tintoretto, and is today housed in the Pinacoteca di Brera and the Accademia in Venice.  The canvas was started by Gentile in July 1504, but after his death in February 1507, when it was \"largely completed\", it passed to his brother Giovanni, as indicated in Gentile's will. Giovanni completed it, making some modifications. The invitation to complete it was probably from his brother just before he died, to which Giovanni probably responded negatively, This explains its insertion in the will of the clause that consigned a precious collection of drawing to Giovanni should he complete the painting. The commission was confirmed as being passed to Giovanni by the Scuola on 7 March 1507.  The scene is rich with exotic elements adapted from real-life that Gentile had the opportunity to study during his trip to Constantinople in 1479\u20131480. Decorative elements of Mamluk architecture, rather than Ottoman, suggest that the artist may also have reached Jerusalem.  It is not clear which parts were done by which brother: Vasari only mentioned Gentile in the 1550 version of the Vite, and omitting them in the 1568 edition. Modern criticism considers Gentile to have done the background, except for the modified parts, and possibly the characters on the right hand. Giovanni is assigned with some certainty the portraits on the left, and some of the central group.  The canvas was reduced at an unknown time, a strip along the top being cut away, where the buildings finished. The work arrived in the Brera in 1809, following the Napoleonic invasion.

It is one of the few mythological pictures by the Venetian artist. Completed in 1514, it was his last major work. It is now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., which calls it \"one of the greatest Renaissance paintings in the United States\".\r The painting is the first major depiction of the subject of the \"Feast of the Gods\" in Renaissance art, which was to remain in currency until the end of Northern Mannerism over a century later. It has several similarities to another, much less sophisticated, treatment of the 1490s by the Florentine artist Bartolomeo di Giovanni, now in the Louvre.\r The painting is signed by an inscription on the fictive paper attached to the wooden tub at lower right: \"joannes bellinus venus / p MDXIIIII\" (\"Giovanni Bellini of Venice, painted 1514\"), and his payment that year is recorded. Based on a narrative by Ovid, it is the earliest of a cycle of paintings, all major works, on mythological subjects produced for Alfonso, I d'Este, the Duke of Ferrara, for his camerino d'alabastro ('chamber of alabaster') in the Castello Estense, Ferrara. The subjects had been chosen by 1511, by the Renaissance humanist Mario Equicola, then working for the Duke's sister Isabella d'Este, and instructions apparently including some sketches were sent to the artists. Later commissions were four large Titians (one now lost), and ten smaller works by Dosso Dossi, probably placed above them. The three surviving Titians painted for the room are Bacchus and Ariadne (National Gallery, London), The Bacchanal of the Andrians and The Worship of Venus (both Prado, Madrid).\r It had been suggested that Bellini made a preliminary set of alterations before or soon after 1514 to make the painting more compatible with the original Latin of Ovid, having previously been working from an Italian Ovidio volgarizzato version, and that at this point Bellini changed most of the characters to gods rather than people from Thebes, giving them attributes and lower necklines for the women. But this view was based on a misunderstanding of the early x-rays taken in 1956. It is now thought that the figures are as originally painted by Bellini. Bellini died in 1516, soon after completing the painting, and some years later Dosso Dossi and perhaps Titian modified the landscape on the left to match it to his The Bacchanal of the Andrians (1518\u20131523), also in Alfonso's Camerino, adding the rocky hill behind the figures and the brighter foliage on a tree at the right. A more thorough reworking by Titian in about 1529 added more landscape, overpainting the earlier changes. But all the work on the figures remains Bellini's. A pheasant in a tree on the right, above Priapus, may have been painted by Alfonso himself, an amateur painter.\n", "\nArtist: Andrea Mantegna\nArtwork Name: St. Jerome in the Wilderness\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-mantegna/st-jerome-in-the-wilderness-1450\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSt Jerome in the Wilderness is a tempera on panel painting, measuring 48 by 36 cm and attributed to Andrea Mantegna. It dates to between 1449 and 1450 and is now in the S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art.\r It is usually thought of as an early work by the artist, shortly after he left the studio of Francesco Squarcione in 1448, enabling him to shift from religious works for third parties to private commissions in a variety of genres, such as this one, thought to have been commissioned by the humanist and poet Ulisse degli Aleotti. It probably also relates to his first trip to Ferrara in 1449 to work at the court of Leonello d'Este. The Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin holds a drawing of St Jerome with a lion, dating to around the same time, with a depiction of the saint that has many similarities to that of the painting, but in a different pose - it may be a preparatory drawing for this composition or a study for another now-lost work.\r The painting merges Jerome the scholar and Jerome the ascetic, the two predominant modes for depicting him. The abandoned sandal in the foreground has probably been borrowed from Flemish works, which Mantegna could have seen in the Este collections. Two hammers are resting on a beam hanging in the cave, possibly referring to Christ's Passion, whilst perched above the cave entrance is a barn owl, traditionally linked to magic and superstition, which Jerome and Ulisse fight with the light of reason.\n", "\nArtist: Andrea Mantegna\nArtwork Name: Presentation at the Temple\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-mantegna/presentation-at-the-temple-1453\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Presentation at the Temple is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Andrea Mantegna.

It was likely commissioned by Borso d'Este during the artist's stay in Ferrara in 1450\u20131451.\r The work, originally on panel, was subsequently moved to canvas at an unknown date, losing a small section on the far right. It is perhaps mentioned in a 1586 inventory of Margherita Gonzaga d'Este's possessions as a \"Prosepio de Andrea Mantegna\" (\"Nativity Scene of Andrea Mantegna\"). By 1603 it was owned by Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini, who kept it in the Villa Aldobrandini, and then it passed to his descendants. Later it was inherited by the Pamphilj, and then by the Borghese. In 1792 it was sold to the painter-dealer Alexander Day, who took it to London. William Buchanan sold it to Richard Payne Knight at Downton Castle, Herefordshire; his eventual heirs sold it to Joseph Duveen. In 1925 it was acquired from Duveen, New York, by Clarence Mackay; it was purchased for the Metropolitan Museum of Art by an anonymous donor.\r The scene is set in an open space, with the Madonna in the middle, adoring the Child while kneeling on a stone step, while to her right St. Joseph is sleeping, and to her left two shepherds pray. St. Joseph's sleep may hint at his role as mere guardian of the Virgin and the Child. The blasted tree on which he leans has born fruit on a single branch; the usual interpretation of this traditional feature is of the mystic renewal of Nature under the new dispensation. Jesus' three-quarters depiction is typical of Mantegna's production.\r On the far left is a fenced orchard, symbolizing Mary's virginity. Also depicted are boards of the ruinous stable in which traditionally Jesus was born. On the right is a wide landscape, framed by two steep mountains. Two other shepherds are represented in the right background, together with a big tree somewhat resembling the Calvary Cross, a presage of Jesus' Passion. There is also an ox, a traditional mute witness of the Nativity.\r Several flaws in the perspective have induced scholars to assign this work to a date near that of the first frescoes executed by Mantegna in the Ovetari Chapel, in particular to the first scenes of the Life of St. James (1448-1450). The attention to detail has been explained by the influence of the Flemish School, which Mantegna could study in the Este family collection, perhaps through a direct knowledge of Rogier van der Weyden. The grotesque portraits of the shepherds, such as their wrinkles and other realistic details, show the influence of northern European examples.\n", "\nArtist: Andrea Mantegna\nArtwork Name: San Zeno Altarpiece\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-mantegna/san-zeno-altarpiece\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe San Zeno Altarpiece is a triptych by the Italian Renaissance painter Andrea Mantegna, from c. 1457-1460.

Their three subjects are the Ascension of Christ (86 by 42.5 cm), Adoration of the Magi the largest and central panel (76 by 76.5 cm) and the Circumcision of Christ (86 by 42.5 cm). They were gathered as a trio in the 19th century, although some art historians doubt that they were created as a triptych set in the way they are now arranged. They are now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.\r Most scholars agree the three works were commissioned in the 1460s for Ludovico III Gonzaga's private chapel in the Castle of St. George in Mantua (together with the Death of the Virgin, now in the Museo del Prado, and Christ Bearing the Soul of the Virgin, now in Ferrara). The paintings for the chapel are mentioned in two letters from Mantegna to Ludovico dated April 1464 and in Vasari as \"a painting [by Mantegna], in which are scenes with small but very beautiful figures ... in the castle at Mantua, for the chapel\".\r Other scholars such as Fiocco argue that there is no evidence for how the three works got from Mantua to Florence and that they were instead produced in Tuscany during one of Mantegna's two trips there in 1466 and 1467. Stylistic reasons, however, link the work to Mantegna's final period in Padua, which ended in 1459, rather than to his maturity in Mantua.\r The first secure reference to the three paintings dates to 1587, when it was found cut up in Valle Muggia near Pistoia among the belongings of Don Antonio de' Medici. They were inherited before in 1632 entering the collection of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, where the Adoration was misattributed to Botticelli. The three works were exhibited together from 1827, with a gilded new neo-Renaissance intaglio frame which compensated for the differing sizes of the central work and the side panels.\r Most modern critics note the differences between the three works, including their form, format, setting and quality, especially between the Circumcision and the other two works. Roberto Longhi doubted that the three works were conceived as a single unified triptych and theorised that instead they all came from different locations in the same chapel, as did Death of the Virgin and Christ Bearing the Soul of the Virgin. According to Longhi, Circumcision replaced Death of the Virgin when it was decided to limit the scheme solely to scenes from Christ's life.\r The panel was probably located in the chapel's apse. The Magi are depicted while descending to the Child's grotto from a path carved out in the rock. The Virgin is portrayed with a crown of angels, according to a Byzantine model.\r Another version of the painting sold for the then record price of $10.5 million in 1985.\n", "\nArtist: Andrea Mantegna\nArtwork Name: Portrait of a Man\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-mantegna/portrait-of-a-man-1460\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of a Man (c. 1460\u20131470) is a painting attributed to the Italian Renaissance artist Andrea Mantegna.

It is now housed in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence.\r Little is known about the painting's origins, and currently the most credited hypothesis is that it would portray Carlo de' Medici, an illegitimate son of Cosimo de' Medici the Elder and a Circassian concubine, as hinted by the subject's intense blue eyes. In 1912 a copy of the portrait was included in a genealogy of the House of Medici. This is however in contrast with the identification of Carlo as a character in Filippino Lippi's Stories of St. Stephen and St. John the Baptist in the Cathedral of Prato. Also the attribution to Mantegna was not immediate, as for a long time the painting was thought to be by Domenico Veneziano.\r The work has been dated from 1459\u20131460, when Mantegna arrived in Mantua and was commissioned numerous official portraits (the subject has been also identified as Ludovico Gonzaga, bishop of Mantua), and 1466, when the painter perhaps travelled to Florence.\r The painting shows the subject from a three-quarter view, an innovation brought in Italy through Flemish masters in the late 15th century; previously profiles, in the ancient Roman tradition, were preferred.\r The subject is dark-skinned and wears the garments of a protonotary apostolic, a position which Carlo held from 1463. The official nature of the painting explains the absence of any psychological element and the attention to details such as the dress and the hat.\n", "\nArtist: Andrea Mantegna\nArtwork Name: Virgin and Child\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-mantegna/virgin-and-child-1470\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna with Sleeping Child is a glue-tempera on canvas painting measuring 43 cm by 32 cm.

While the dating of the piece is debated, it was completed between 1475 and 1501, probably in the early 1480s. It portrays the body of Christ supine on a marble slab. He is watched over by the Virgin Mary and Saint John and St. Mary Magdalene weeping for his death.\r The theme of the Lamentation of Christ is common in medieval and Renaissance art, although this treatment, dating back to a subject known as the Anointing of Christ is unusual for the period. Most Lamentations show much more contact between the mourners and the body. Rich contrasts of light and shadow abound, infused by a profound sense of pathos. The realism and tragedy of the scene are enhanced by the violent perspective, which foreshortens and dramatizes the recumbent figure, stressing the anatomical details: in particular, Christ's thorax. The holes in Christ's hands and feet, as well as the faces of the two mourners, are portrayed without any concession to idealism or rhetoric. The sharply drawn drapery which covers the corpse contributes to the dramatic effect. The composition places the central focus of the image on Christ's genitals - an emphasis often found in figures of Jesus, especially as an infant, in this period, which has been related to a theological emphasis on the Humanity of Jesus by Leo Steinberg and others.\r Mantegna presented both a harrowing study of a strongly foreshortened cadaver and an intensely poignant depiction of a biblical tragedy. This painting is one of many examples of the artist's mastery of perspective. At first glance, the painting seems to display an exact perspective. However, careful scrutiny reveals that Mantegna reduced the size of the figure's feet, which, as he must have known, would cover much of the body if properly represented.\r Mantegna probably made this painting for his personal funerary chapel. It was found by his sons in his studio after his death and sold off to pay debts. The painting is now in the Pinacoteca di Brera of Milan, Italy.\n", "\nArtist: Andrea Mantegna\nArtwork Name: Madonna and Child with Cherubs\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-mantegna/madonna-and-child-with-cherubs-1490\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna with the Cherubim is a c.1485 painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Andrea Mantegna.\n", "\nArtist: Andrea Mantegna\nArtwork Name: The Virgin of Victory (The Madonna and Child Enthroned with Six Saints and Adored by Gian Francesco II Gonzaga)\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-mantegna/the-virgin-of-victory-the-madonna-and-child-enthroned-with-six-saints-and-adored-by-gian-1496\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna della Vittoria is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Andrea Mantegna; the painting was executed in 1496.\r On 6 July 1495 the French army of Charles VIII of France, retreating from Italy after the French Invasion of 1494-1498, fought the Italic League at the Battle of Fornovo. The League, commanded by Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua, was made up of numerous nation-states determined to prevent French dominance in Italy, and included the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, Venice, Milan, and the Papal States controlled by Pope Alexander VI. Though the League lost more soldiers, they had also captured more soldiers than had the French; they also recovered nearly all of the plunder the French had taken over the course of their four-year invasion.\r Particularly valued items included the helmet, sword, and seal of Charles VIII, as well as a book containing portraits of the ladies whose favors he had enjoyed during the invasion. During Francesco's absence from Mantua, Daniele da Norsa, a Jewish banker, had purchased a house in the city's San Simone quarter and replaced the image of the Virgin Mary which decorated its fa\u00e7ade with his own coat of arms. The regent, Sigismondo Gonzaga, ordered him to restore the depiction. Although Daniele agreed to do so, the populace, inflamed by anti-semitic feeling, destroyed his house.\r When Francesco returned, he forced Daniele to fund a chapel and a devotional painting. The painting was to be executed by the Mantuan court painter, Mantegna, and was inaugurated in 1496 on the anniversary of the duke's victory at Fornovo. The work was placed in the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria, which had been constructed over the ruins of Daniele da Norsa's house.\r The painting was one of the works looted by the French during the Napoleonic invasion of Italy, and by 1798 was being exhibited in the Louvre. The painting was never returned; the given excuse was that its large size made the transport difficult. The presence of a sulphur-crested cockatoo in the painting is being investigated by historians as it may have implications on our understanding of 15th-century trading networks.\r The altarpiece shows Francesco Gonzaga paying homage to Mary, who sits on a high throne decorated with marbles intarsias and bas-reliefs. The base of the throne, with lion paws, has, within a medallion, the inscription \"REGINA/CELI LET./ALLELVIA\" (Queen of Heaven, rejoice, Alleluia); it lies on a circular basement with a bas-relief of the \"Original Sin\" and other stories from the Book of Genesis which are partly obscured by the praying figures. The throne's back has a large solar disc, decorated with weavings and vitreous pearls.\r The child Jesus, who holds two red flowers (symbols of the Passion) and Mary look at Francesco Gonzaga, who is kneeling and has a grateful and smiling expression while receiving their blessing. The protection given to Gonzaga during the battle is also symbolized by Mary's mantle, which partially covers his head. Opposite to the donor are St. John the Baptist with a cross featuring the usual cartouche saying \"ECCE/AGNVS/DEI ECCE/Q[VI] TOLL/IT P[ECCATA] M[VNDI]\" (Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sins of the world), and his mother, St. Elizabeth, protector of Isabella d'Este, wife of Francesco Gonzaga. The choice of St. Elizabeth in the place of a patron may have been chosen as a message of judgement to the Norsa who were made to pay for the work as a penalty for removing an image of the Madonna from their home. Unlike the Norsa, St. Elizabeth who is represented as a Jewess in a yellow turban, was said to be the first to recognize the sanctity of Mary.\n", "\nArtist: Andrea Mantegna\nArtwork Name: The Holy Family with Saint Mary Magdalen\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-mantegna/the-holy-family-with-saint-mary-magdalen-1500\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Altman Madonna or 'Holy Family with St Mary Magdalene is a glue-tempera and gold on canvas painting, measuring 57.2 by 45.7 cm and dating to 1495-1505.

The construction was begun in the 15th century on the site of two pre-existing Romanesque, \"twin\" cathedrals (Santo Stefano and Santa Maria del Popolo). The cathedral houses the remains of St. Sirus, first Bishop of Pavia, and a thorn purported to be from the Crown of Thorns worn by Christ. The marble facing of the exterior was never completed.  Until recently, next to the cathedral stood the Civic Tower (Torre Civica), known in 1330 and enlarged in 1583. It collapsed on March 17, 1989.    The cathedral was begun in 1488, under architect Cristoforo Rocchi, who was soon replaced by Giovanni Antonio Amadeo and Gian Giacomo Dolcebuono. The original project, with a nave and two aisles flanked by semicircular niches and a large central dome, was influenced by Bramante, some details of it later appearing in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Leonardo da Vinci is also known to have contributed to the project.  In 1521, the altar area was completed by Gianpietrino Rizzi, a pupil of Da Vinci. By the 17th century, the presbytery had been completed but only in the following century was the tambour built, while the dome itself and the facade had to wait for the 19th century. The dome was designed by Carlo Maciachini and completed in 1885, but partially collapsed the same year. In 1930, construction continued with the two arms of the transept, for which the original plan was followed, although using reinforced concrete (in order to save the remains of the medieval Santa Maria del Popolo). The arms are still missing part of the internal marble decoration.  The church is on the Greek Cross plan: it therefore has the same length and width at the transept. At about 84\u00a0m (276\u00a0ft), it is one of the largest edifices with a central plan in northern Italy. The central dome, with an octagonal plan, is 97\u00a0m (318\u00a0ft) tall, with a total weight of some 20,000 tons. It is the fourth in Italy in size, after St. Peter's Basilica, the Pantheon and the Cathedral of Florence.\n", "\nArtist: Donato Bramante\nArtwork Name: Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio - Bramante's arcades\nArtwork Genre: architecture\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/donato-bramante/basilica-of-santambrogio-bramantes-arcades-1492\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio (official name: Basilica romana minore collegiata abbaziale prepositurale di Sant'Ambrogio) is a church in the centre of Milan, northern Italy.  One of the most ancient churches in Milan, it was built by St. Ambrose in 379\u2013386, in an area where numerous martyrs of the Roman persecutions had been buried. The first name of the church was in fact Basilica Martyrum.  When St. Ambrose arrived in Milan, the local churches were in conflict with each other over the conflict between Arianism and the Nicene Creed as well as numerous local issues.  He was firmly in support of the Nicene side of the conflict, and wanted to make northern Italy into a pro-Rome stronghold.  He did this through both preaching and construction.  He built three or four churches surrounding the city; Basilica Apostolorum (now San Nazaro in Brolo), Basilica Virginum (now San Simpliciano), and Basilica Martyrum (which was later renamed in his honor).  A fourth church, Basilica Salvatoris (now San Dionigi) is attributed to him as well, but may not actually be from the 4th century.  These churches were dedicated with anti-Arian language and as symbols of the wealth and power of the pro-Nicene faction in Milan.  In the centuries after its construction, the edifice underwent several restorations and partial reconstructions, assuming the current appearance in the 12th Century, when it was rebuilt in the Romanesque style.  Initially, the basilica was outside the city of Milan, but over the following centuries, the city grew up around it.  It became a center of religious life and a community of canons developed in the church.  In 789, a monastery was established within the basilica grounds.  The canons, however, retained their own community and identity instead of fading away.  Two, separate, distinct religious communities shared the basilica.  In the 11th century, the canons adopted orders and became Canons Regular.  There were now two separate monastic orders following different rules living in the basilica.  The canons were in the northern building, the cloister of the canons, while the monks were in the two southern buildings.  The two towers symbolize the division in the basilica. The 9th-century Torre dei Monaci (\"Tower of the Monks\") tower was used by the monks to call the faithful to the monks' mass. The monks supported themselves, partly, from the offerings given after mass. However, the canons did not have a bell tower and were not allowed to ring bells until they finished their own tower (on the north side) in the 12th century.  The monastery and church became a large landholder in northern Italy and into what is now the Swiss Canton of Ticino. On 4 August 1528 it was the so-called \"Peace of St. Ambrose\", between the noble and popular factions of the city, was signed here. In 1492 the Benedictines commissioned Donato Bramante, structural architect of St. Peter's Basilica, to renovate the new rectory.  In August 1943 the Allied bombings heavily damaged the basilica, in particular the apse and surrounding area. As a result of this a new building,  painted in pink, was constructed to house the Abbot's offices and the museum.\n", "\nArtist: Donato Bramante\nArtwork Name: Apostolic Palace\nArtwork Genre: architecture\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/donato-bramante/apostolic-palace\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Apostolic Palace (Latin: Palatium Apostolicum; Italian: Palazzo Apostolico) is the official residence of the pope, the head of the Catholic Church, located in Vatican City. It is also known as the Papal Palace, the Palace of the Vatican and the Vatican Palace. The Vatican itself refers to the building as the Palace of Sixtus V, in honor of Pope Sixtus V, who built most of the present form of the palace.  The building contains the Papal Apartments, various offices of the Catholic Church and the Holy See, private and public chapels, Vatican Museums, and the Vatican Library, including the Sistine Chapel, Raphael Rooms, and Borgia Apartment.  The modern tourist can see these last and other parts of the palace, but other parts, such as the Sala Regia (Regal Room) and Cappella Paolina, had long been closed to tourists, though the Sala Regia allowed occasional tourism by 2019. The Scala Regia (Regal Staircase) can be viewed from one end and used to enter the Sala Regia. The Cappella Paolina, however, remains closed to tourists.  In the fifth century, Pope Symmachus built a papal palace close to the Old St. Peter's Basilica which served an alternative residence to the Lateran Palace. The construction of a second fortified palace was sponsored by Pope Eugene III and extensively modified under Pope Innocent III in the twelfth century.  Upon returning to Rome in 1377 after the interlude of the Avignon Papacy, which saw Rome subject to civil unrest and the abandonment of several Christian monuments, the popes chose to reside first at Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere and then at Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. The Vatican Palace had fallen into disrepair from lack of upkeep and the Lateran Palace underwent two destructive fires, in 1307 and 1361, which did irreparable harm. In 1447, Pope Nicholas V razed the ancient fortified palace of Eugene III to erect a new building, the current Apostolic Palace.  In the 15th century, the Palace was placed under the authority of a prefect. This position of Apostolic Prefect lasted from the 15th century till the 1800s, when the Papal States fell into economic difficulties. In 1884, when this post was reviewed in light of saving money, Pope Leo XIII created a committee to administer the palace.  The major additions and decorations of the palace are the work of the following popes for 150 years. Construction of the current version of the palace began on 30 April 1589 under Pope Sixtus V and its various intrinsic parts were completed by later successors, Pope Urban VII, Pope Innocent XI and Pope Clement VIII. In the 20th century, Pope Pius XI built a monumental art gallery and museum entrance.  Construction of the Papal Palace (also known as the Apostolic Palace or Vatican Palace) at the Vatican in Vatican City, took place mainly between 1471 and 1605. Covering 162,000 square metres (1,743,753  square feet), it contains the Papal Apartments, offices of the Roman Catholic Church and Holy See, chapels, Vatican Library, museums and art galleries.  The Apostolic Palace is run by the Prefecture of the Pontifical Household.  The palace is more accurately a series of self-contained buildings within the well-recognized outer structure which is arranged around the Courtyard of Sixtus V (Cortile di Sisto V).

Behind Mary extends a garden with its pink roses dominating the foreground. Below her is a floor with framed marble tiles which demonstrates the painter's mastery of perspective technique.\r The roses symbolize one of the titles of Mary, \"Mystical Rose\". The pomegranate, which Mary holds in her hand and which the Child is tasting, symbolizes fertility, royalty, and with its red color, the blood of the Passion of Jesus.\r The work shows incisive use of chiaroscuro reminiscent of Verrocchio, in whose workshop Botticelli may have trained. The same type of child, with a large oval head and joyful lively expression, can be seen in Verrocchio's sculpture Putto con delfino from the same period. The figure of Mary is elongated and loosely posed, much more so than in the works of Filippo Lippi, another of the young Botticelli's models.\r There are some uncertainties in space such as the disproportion of the architectural background which is too small compared to the figure of Mary and also compared to the flowers in the garden behind her.\n", "\nArtist: Sandro Botticelli\nArtwork Name: Madonna and Child with an Angel\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: tempera,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/madonna-and-child-with-an-angel\n\nWikipedia Article:\nVirgin and Child with an Angel also known as Our Lady of the Eucharist (Italian: Madonna dell'Eucarestia) is a tempera on wood panel painting by Sandro Botticelli made c.1470.

The painting features a young man displaying in triangled hands a medal stamped with the likeness of Cosimo de' Medici. The identity of the young man has been a long-enduring mystery. Completed in approximately 1475, it is on display in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence.\r Central to the painting, seated before a landscape, is a young man with a medal between his hands. The man gazes out into the audience, while the medal displays the profiled likeness of Cosimo de' Medici. The medal is a pastiglia imitation of a real metal medal, made of gilded gesso and inset into the portrait. As the medal is not reversed, evidently Botticelli either had access to the original mold or made a cast from the medal to produce his gesso. The medal appears to be the same as one possibly designed by Donatello and cast in 1465, an example of which is in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, England, called \"Cosimo de' Medici as Pater Patriae\".(link)\r The portrait is remarkable in part for the orientation of its subject. In 1997's The Sculptures of Adrea del Verrocchio, Andrew Butterfield suggests that Botticelli may have \"attempted to devise a new format for portraits\" with this and his Smeralda Bandinelli, by placing his subjects in the same \"continuum\" with their audience, directly engaging him.\r The identity of the young man in the portrait has never been agreed, but there has been considerable speculation. Writing in 1900, art historian George Noble Plunkett colorfully identified whom he believed the youth portrayed:\r Contemporary biographer Guido Cornini notes other theories held by historians: the youth\u2014who wears garments appropriate to the middle class\u2014may be one of the possible designers of the medal (Michelozzo Niccol\u00f2 Fiorentino, Cristoforo di Geremia), a member of the Medici family (including, possibly, Cosimo de' Medici himself) or, as he personally felt more likely, Antonio Botticelli, Botticelli's brother. This, he asserts, is based on the strength of the likeness of the youth to Botticelli himself, as portrayed in his Adoration of the Magi. Antonio Botticelli had also recast and gilded medals, working in the court of the Medicis. However, he would have been about 40 at the time of the portrait.\r Frederick Hartt suggested it might be Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici (Il Poplano, 1463\u20131503), whose two certain portraits, both profiles on medals, vary considerably, though one resembles this. He is also sometimes claimed to be the subject of other Botticelli portraits, with completely different features (e.g. Pitti Palace, wearing a chaperon).\r The appearance at auction in 1982, from the Thomas Merton collection, of a rarely seen painting by Botticelli of a young man identified (with no real evidence) as Giovanni il Popolano in a similar pose, holding up a round medallion cut from a much older painting (albeit of a bearded saint, not Cosimo), has led to speculation that this might be a companion piece, and thus that the young man in this portrait is possibly his brother, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici. (the long dark locks and facial features are not dissimilar from those found on Mercury in Botticelli's Primavera, another presumed representation of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco.) The cut-out now in place may not be the original insertion; it may have been another medal of Cosimo. If so, the meaning of the medallion over the heart may simply be a profession of the loyalty of the cadet branch of the Popolani to the branch of Cosimo.\n", "\nArtist: Sandro Botticelli\nArtwork Name: The Adoration of the Magi\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/adoration-of-the-magi-1476-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Adoration of the Magi is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli, dating from 1475 or 1476, early in his career. The work is on display at the Uffizi in Florence. Botticelli was commissioned to paint at least seven versions of The Adoration of the Magi.\r In the scene numerous characters are present, among which are several members of the Medici family: Cosimo de' Medici (the Magus kneeling in front of the Virgin, described by Vasari as \"the finest of all that are now extant for its life and vigour\"), his sons Piero (the second Magus kneeling in the centre with the red mantle) and Giovanni (the third Magus), and his grandsons Giuliano and Lorenzo. The three Medici portrayed as Magi were all dead at the time the picture was painted, and Florence was effectively ruled by Lorenzo.\r Whether Botticelli's intimate relations with the Medici brothers allowed the wealthy Gaspare to introduce the portraits of their kinsmen in his altar-piece, or Gaspare was glad for this opportunity to pay a graceful compliment to these powerful personages is hard to tell. It is, however, apparent from the great pains in which Botticelli bestowed on these figures, that this formed an important part of the task.\r Also Gaspare himself is said to be included in the painting, as the old man on the right with white hair and a light blue robe looking and pointing at the observer. Furthermore, also Botticelli is alleged to have made a self-portrait as the blonde man with yellow mantle on the far right.\r In his Lives, Vasari describes the Adoration in the following way:\r The attention to details, such as the garments rendering, show the acquisition by the Florentine artist of the influences from the Flemish school at this point of his career.\n", "\nArtist: Sandro Botticelli\nArtwork Name: Giuliano de Medici\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/giuliano-de-medici-1478\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Giuliano de' Medici is a painting of Giuliano de' Medici (1453-1478) by the Italian Renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli, probably painted soon before Giuliano was assassinated in the Pazzi Conspiracy in 1478.

The painting is executed in tempera on panel. It dates from between 1480 and 1483.\r The Madonna of the Book is a soft and elegant work, in which Mary and the Child are seated by a window in the corner of a room. She holds a Book of Hours, the Horae Beatae Mariae Virginis, prayer books for laymen common in the thirteenth to sixteenth centuries. The infant is gazing at his mother whilst she is absorbed in reading the book. The hands of both mother and son are positioned similarly, with the right hands open as in a gesture of blessing, and left hands closed.\r Symbolizing the Passion of Christ, the Christ Child is holding the three nails of the cross, and the crown of thorns. These are probably later additions, added to make the message more explicit. This is the conventional representation in the Christian iconography. In addition, the fruit in the bowl has an emblematic meaning. The cherries represent the blood of Christ or are an allusion to Paradise, plums indicate the tenderness between Mary and the Child, and the figs are characteristic of the Resurrection.\r Mary's blue robe, a color she is often depicted wearing, has the symbolic meanings of purity, heaven, and royalty. In this painting, as in Botticelli's other large series, the Madonna is portrayed as being serious, thoughtful and focused.\r Botticelli interprets the scene with a sensitivity and love for small details: the set of boxes and the maiolica bowl of lush fruits are depicted as a still life; the pages of the book, the garments, and the transparent veils exhibit a realistic tactile quality. The composition is refined with a good balance. Botticelli painted with subtle differences in colour, and he was able to put colours together so that they complement each other admirably. The painting is adorned with gold filigree decorating the clothes and objects. The use of gold was the result of the contractual agreement he made with the commissioner, and was included in the price of the painting. Dating from about 1480, the painting shows all the elements of Botticelli's mature poetic style: a delicate, elegant linearity, a style which is still far from the intense pathos of his late work.\" The identity of his patron is unknown.\r The interrelationship of light, shapes and voids confers an ethereal quality to the work. Indeed, the painting might be considered as newly rediscovered, as a recent restoration revealed a luminescent sky and bright morning aura, which had been obscured by layers of centuries-old varnish. One is reminded of other Marian images made prior to the year 1470. Botticelli might have been influenced by Filippo Lippi's Madonna and Child with an Angel from the Hospital of the Innocents in Florence.\r Botticelli and the Madonna of the Book were the subject of renewed interest in the 19th century. In its \"extraordinary beauty\" it appealed to Italians in particular who saw in it a source of national identity, during Italian unification (\"Risorgimento\"). Among Botticelli's admirers was Gian Giacomo Poldi Pezzoli, who bequeathed his private collection and his apartment to the public. Dr Annalisa Zanni, the Poldi Pezzoli Museum director, recently discovered more about Botticelli's technique and use of materials, as exemplified in the Madonna of the Book. For example, she discovered that Botticelli's top layer of blue was lapis lazuli, a \"very precious and very expensive ingredient, indicating it was commissioned by a highly prestigious patron\".\n", "\nArtist: Sandro Botticelli\nArtwork Name: The Spring\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/primavera-1478\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPrimavera (Italian pronunciation:\u00a0[prima\u02c8ve\u02d0ra], meaning \"Spring\"), is a large panel painting in tempera paint by the Italian Renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli made in the late 1470s or early 1480s (datings vary). It has been described as \"one of the most written about, and most controversial paintings in the world\", and also \"one of the most popular paintings in Western art\".\r The painting depicts a group of figures from classical mythology in a garden, but no story has been found that brings this particular group together. Most critics agree that the painting is an allegory based on the lush growth of Spring, but accounts of any precise meaning vary, though many involve the Renaissance Neoplatonism which then fascinated intellectual circles in Florence. The subject was first described as Primavera by the art historian Giorgio Vasari who saw it at Villa Castello, just outside Florence, by 1550.\r Although the two are now known not to be a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed with Botticelli's other very large mythological painting, The Birth of Venus, also in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the Italian Renaissance; of the two, the Birth is even better known than the Primavera. As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity. It used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain.\r The history of the painting is not certainly known, though it seems to have been commissioned by one of the Medici family. It draws from a number of classical and Renaissance literary sources, including the works of the Ancient Roman poet Ovid and, less certainly, Lucretius, and may also allude to a poem by Poliziano, the Medici house poet who may have helped Botticelli devise the composition. Since 1919 the painting has been part of the collection of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.\r The painting features six female figures and two male, along with a cupid, in an orange grove. The movement of the composition is from right to left, so following that direction the standard identification of the figures is: at far right \"Zephyrus, the biting wind of March, kidnaps and possesses the nymph Chloris, whom he later marries and transforms into a deity; she becomes the goddess of Spring, eternal bearer of life, and is scattering roses on the ground.\" Chloris the nymph overlaps Flora, the goddess she transforms into.\r In the centre (but not exactly so) and somewhat set back from the other figures stands Venus, a red-draped woman in blue. Like the flower-gatherer, she returns the viewer's gaze. The trees behind her form a broken arch to draw the eye. In the air above her a blindfolded Cupid aims his bow to the left. On the left of the painting the Three Graces, a group of three females also in diaphanous white, join hands in a dance. At the extreme left Mercury, clothed in red with a sword and a helmet, raises his caduceus or wooden rod towards some wispy gray clouds.\n", "\nArtist: Sandro Botticelli\nArtwork Name: Pallas and Centaur\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/pallas-and-centaur\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPallas and the Centaur is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli, c. 1482. It is now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. It has been proposed as a companion piece to his Primavera, though it is a different shape. The medium used is tempera paints on canvas and its size is 207 x 148 cm. The painting has been retouched in many places, and these retouchings have faded.\r The life-size figures are from classical mythology and probably form an allegory. There is a centaur on the left, and a female figure holding a very elaborate and no doubt heavy halberd on the right. She is clutching the centaur's hair, and he seems submissive to her. The female figure was called Camilla in the earliest record of the painting, an inventory of 1499, but then in an inventory of 1516 she is called Minerva, the Roman equivalent of Pallas Athene, which remains her usual identification in recent times.\r Camilla was a figure from specifically Roman mythology (if not just invented by Virgil for the Aeneid), a princess raised in the forest by her father, the exiled King Metabus, to be a virgin warrior huntress, for whom subduing a centaur might be considered all in a day's work. Pallas/Minerva, by contrast, is a major deity, goddess of wisdom, trade and much else. Centaurs are associated with uncontrolled passion, lust and sensuality, and at least part of the meaning of the painting is clearly about the submission of passion to reason. Various more specific personal, political and philosophical meanings along these general lines have been proposed.\r The fine cloth of Pallas' clinging dress is decorated with the three ring insignia of the Medici family, confirming that the painting was made for the Medici family. She wears laurel branches, entwined around her arms and chest as a crown; these were often a punning allusion to Lorenzo de' Medici. On her back is a shield and she wears leather sandals on her feet. The halberd, especially in such large and elaborate form, was a weapon carried by guards rather than on the battlefield, and the centaur has apparently been arrested while preparing to shoot his bow.\r The painting is usually dated to about 1482 or 1483 on stylistic grounds, soon after Botticelii's return from Rome, where he had been part of the project to paint the Sistine Chapel. The features of the centaur are close to those of Moses in one of his frescos there. The painting is often connected with the wedding in 1482 of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici to Semiramide Appiano, perhaps as a wedding gift from Lorenzo de' Medici (Lorenzo il Magnifico\").\r Given the Medici device on Pallas' dress, it was presumably commissioned by the Medici family, as were many of Botticelli\u2019s paintings, and has passed to the Uffizi with much of their collection. In 1499 an inventory lists it in the same room as Botticelli's Primavera, in the town palace in Florence of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici and his brother Giovanni \"Il Popolano\". They were the cousins of Lorenzo de' Medici, de facto ruler of Florence, and after their father's early death had been his wards. In the later 16th century it hung in the Palazzo Vecchio. In 1638 it was at the Medici Villa di Castello, as was the Primavera, then it is recorded in the Pitti Palace by about 1830, by which time Botticelli was unfashionable and regarded as mainly of historical interest.\n", "\nArtist: Sandro Botticelli\nArtwork Name: Portrait\u00a0of a Young\u00a0Man\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: tempera,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/portrait-of-a-young-man-1483-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of a Young Man is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli, c. 1483.

It measures 83\u00a0x\u00a0138\u00a0cm and is held in the Prado in Madrid.\r The picture is one of a series of four, possibly commissioned by Lorenzo the Magnificent in 1483 to donate to Giannozzo Pucci on the occasion of his wedding to Lucrezia Bini that year. The four were held in the Palazzo Pucci in Florence until 1868, when they were sold. The first three are now in the Prado, and the last one is now in original location after having spent some time in the Watney Collection in Charlbury, Oxfordshire, England.\r The story of Nastagio degli Onesti, a nobleman of Ravenna, is the eighth tale of the fifth day in The Decameron by Giovanni Boccaccio. This theme was chosen for its happy ending to a love affair, in which the daughter of Paolo Traversari, who rejects Nastagio's courting, changes her mind after witnessing the infernal punishment of another woman guilty of the same sin of ingratitude towards her lover.\r The first episode of the story is set in a pine wood around Ravenna, the city where the story takes place. Nastagio has left the city, disappointed by his unreturned affection, and wanders alone and sorrowful. He is surprised by the sudden appearance of a woman being chased by a knight and his dogs, which seize her in their teeth in spite of Nastagio's attempts to defend her.\r On the left in the painting are some tents, in which Nastagio (in the red hose) is seen being advised by his friends to leave town for a while. Then Nastagio is shown in close-up, roaming the forest. He appears again nearby with a stick, seeking to drive away the dogs that are trying to bite a half-naked woman, chased by a dashing knight with a sword and golden armour.\r The scene has a strong narrative character, showing successive scenes within one picture and requiring three representations of Nastagio, a typically late medieval procedure. The tall, upright trunks of the trees combine with the horizontal seascape in the background to form a kind of grid, giving a remarkable effect of depth. The drama combines with the formal elegance of the slender figures and the graceful gestures of people and animals to achieve a magical suspension between fable and reality. Although the conception of the four pictures is due to Botticelli, the execution was entrusted in part to his assistants, in particular Bartolomeo di Giovanni for the first three pictures and Jacopo da Sellaio for the fourth.\n", "\nArtist: Sandro Botticelli\nArtwork Name: Venus and Mars\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/venus-and-mars-1483-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nVenus and Mars (or Mars and Venus) is a panel painting of about 1485 by the Italian Renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli. It shows the Roman gods Venus, goddess of love, and Mars, god of war, in an allegory of beauty and valour. The youthful and voluptuous couple recline in a forest setting, surrounded by playful baby satyrs.\r The painting was probably intended to commemorate a wedding, set into panelling or a piece of furniture to adorn the bedroom of the bride and groom, possibly as part of a set of works. This is suggested by the wide format and the close view of the figures. It is widely seen as representation of an ideal view of sensuous love. It seems likely that Botticelli worked out the concept for the painting, with its learned allusions, with an advisor such as Poliziano, the Medici house poet and Renaissance Humanist scholar.\r The National Gallery's dating in 2017 of \"c. 1485\" has been followed here. Lightbown dates it to \"probably around 1483\", but the Ettlingers to \"the latter half of the 1480s\". All dates depend on analysis of the style, as the painting has not been convincingly tied to a specific date, such as a wedding. It therefore comes a few years after the Primavera and Pallas and the Centaur (both about 1482) and around the time of The Birth of Venus (c. 1486). It is the only one of these paintings not in the Uffizi in Florence, and has been in the National Gallery in London since 1874.\r Venus watches Mars sleep while two infant satyrs play, carrying his helmet (a sallet) and lance as another rests inside his breastplate under his arm. A fourth blows a small conch shell in his ear in an effort, so far unsuccessful, to wake him. The clear implication is that the couple have been making love, and the male habit of falling asleep after sex was a regular subject for ribald jokes in the context of weddings in Renaissance Italy. The lance and conch can be read as sexual symbols.\r The scene is set in a grove of myrtle, traditionally associated with Venus and marriage, or possibly laurel, associated with Lorenzo de' Medici (il Magnifico), or perhaps both plants. There is a limited view of the meadow beyond, leading to a distant walled city.\r In the foreground, a swarm of wasps hovers around Mars' head, possibly as a symbol that love is often accompanied by pain. Another explanation, first suggested by Ernst Gombrich, is that the wasps represent the Vespucci family that may have commissioned the painting. They had been neighbours of Botticelli since his childhood, and had commissioned his Saint Augustine in His Study for the Ognissanti church in 1480, probably in addition to other commissions. Their coat of arms included wasps, as their name means \"little wasps\" in Italian, and the wasps' nest, in a hollow in the tree in the top left corner, is exactly in the place in the panel where the coat of arms of a patron was often painted.\n", "\nArtist: Sandro Botticelli\nArtwork Name: Portrait\u00a0of a young\u00a0woman\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: tempera,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/portrait-of-a-young-woman-1485\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of a Young Woman is a painting which is commonly believed to be by the Italian Renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli, executed between 1480 and 1485.

It depicts the goddess Venus arriving at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from the sea fully-grown (called Venus Anadyomene and often depicted in art). The painting is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.\r Although the two are not a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed with Botticelli's other very large mythological painting, the Primavera, also in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the Italian Renaissance; of the two, the Birth is even better known than the Primavera. As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity, as was the size and prominence of a nude female figure in the Birth. It used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain.\r They have been endlessly analysed by art historians, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations (generally agreed), the influence of Renaissance Neo-Platonism (somewhat controversial), and the identity of the commissioners (not agreed). Most art historians agree, however, that the Birth does not require complex analysis to decode its meaning, in the way that the Primavera probably does. While there are subtleties in the painting, its main meaning is a straightforward, if individual, treatment of a traditional scene from Greek mythology, and its appeal is sensory and very accessible, hence its enormous popularity.\r In the centre the newly-born goddess Venus stands nude in a giant scallop shell. Its size is purely imaginary, and is also found in classical depictions of the subject. At the left the wind god Zephyr blows at her, with the wind shown by lines radiating from his mouth. He is in the air, and carries a young female, who is also blowing, but less forcefully. Both have wings. Vasari was probably correct in identifying her as \"Aura\", personification of a lighter breeze. Their joint efforts are blowing Venus towards the shore, and blowing the hair and clothes of the other figures to the right.\r At the right a female figure who may be floating slightly above the ground holds out a rich cloak or dress to cover Venus when she reaches the shore, as she is about to do. She is one of the three Horae or Hours, Greek minor goddesses of the seasons and of other divisions of time, and attendants of Venus. The floral decoration of her dress suggests she is the Hora of Spring.\r Alternative identifications for the two secondary female figures involve those also found in the Primavera; the nymph held by Zephyr may be Chloris, a flower nymph he married in some versions of her story, and the figure on land may be Flora. Flora is generally the Roman equivalent of the Greek Chloris; in the Primavera Chloris is transformed into the figure of Flora next to her, following Ovid's Fasti, but it is hard to see that such a transformation is envisaged here. However, the roses blown along with the two flying figures would be appropriate for Chloris.\n", "\nArtist: Sandro Botticelli\nArtwork Name: The Cestello Annunciation\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/the-cestello-annunciation\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Cestello Annunciation, is a painting in tempera on panel made in 1489 for the church of the Florentine monastery of Cestello, which is now known as Santa Maria Maddalena de'Pazzi.\r The subject of the painting is the Annunciation, in which the archangel Gabriel visits the Virgin Mary to 'announce' to her (hence 'Annuciation') that she has been chosen by God to bear the Christ child should she accept this invitation.

The Lamentation over Dead Christ, circa 1492, is currently housed in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich.\r The painting depicts the lamentation (expression of great sorrow or deep sadness)  over Christ\u2019s death. The Virgin Mary sits vertically with the dead Christ on her lap, his body appearing extremely small. The positioning of the two bodies creates the Pieta, which means pity in Italian and is a representation of The Virgin Mary mourning dead Christ. The Three Maries are circling the inner group expressing despair. Mary Magdalen is positioned at the feet of Christ in turmoil. St.John sits above The Virgin Mary and cradles her head in an attempt to soothe her. Joseph of Arimathea stands above the group holding the crown of thorns and three nails. Botticelli paints the figures in contorted and distorted poses. He does not apply the rules of naturalism to the painting. Instead, he focuses on his own personal preference of geometry. This very style of geometry had an influence on third generation renaissance painters to come.\r Sandro Botticelli was a second generation renaissance painter born Allesandro di Mariano Filipepi in 1445. His nickname was Botticelli meaning little barrel. The renaissance began in fourteenth century Italy. Dramatic changes in art, architecture, and sculpture took place during this time. Botticelli has been noted as one of the most powerful painters of the lyrical current. In his later works, Botticelli developed a more personal style, particularly in his religious themed art. He is believed to have been influenced by Girolamo Savonarola. His range of work included religious pieces, mythical themes, portraits, alter pieces and Madonna (art). Additional famous works by Botticelli include Birth of Venus (Botticelli), Primavera (painting) and The Mystical Nativity.\n", "\nArtist: Sandro Botticelli\nArtwork Name: Calumny of Apelles\nArtwork Genre: literary painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/calumny-of-apelles\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Calumny of Apelles is a tempera panel painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli. Based on the description of an ancient lost painting by Apelles, the work was completed in about 1494\u201395, and is now in the Uffizi, Florence.\r The content of Apelles' painting, as described by Lucian, became popular in Renaissance Italy, and Botticelli was neither the first nor last Italian Renaissance artist to depict it. Leon Battista Alberti had praised it and recommended it as a subject for artists to recreate in his highly influential De pictura of 1435, and there were four translations of Lucian's Greek into Latin or Italian during the 15th century.\r A number of Botticelli's secular works show an interest in recreating some of the lost glories of Ancient Greek painting, which are recorded in classical literature, especially the ekphrasis, a popular literary genre consisting of the description of a painting, which had an obvious utility before reproductions were widespread. His Mars and Venus, painted some ten years earlier, is generally agreed to borrow part of its composition, the infant satyrs playing with Mars' armour, from another ekphrasis by Lucian, but no other Botticelli painting is clearly an attempt to recreate an ancient composition almost in full.\r The painting is an allegory with nine figures (as well as many painted statues) but at 62 x 91 cm is far smaller than his large mythological paintings, but larger than the usual size of his spalliere pieces intended to be fitted into panelling or furniture. However, it is comparable in size to his Mystical Nativity, and like that may have been painted for his own use. It was completed around 1494 or 1495, and is probably the last secular painting of his to survive. It is often speculated that Botticelli had a specific slandered individual in mind, perhaps himself, or Savonarola. In 1502, some years after the probable date of the painting, an anonymous denunciation to the authorities accused Botticelli of sodomy.\r The figures are either personifications of vices or virtues, or in the case of the king and victim, of the roles of the powerful and the powerless. From left to right, they represent (with alternative names): Truth, nude and pointing upwards to Heaven; Repentance in black; Perfidy (Conspiracy) in red and yellow, over the innocent half-naked victim on the floor, who is being pulled forward by the hair by Calumny (Slander), in white and blue and holding a flaming torch. Fraud, behind, arranges Calumny's hair. Rancour (Envy), a bearded and hooded man in black, holds his hand towards the king's eyes to obscure their view. On the throne, the king has the donkey's ears of King Midas, and Ignorance on his far side and Suspicion on the near side grasp these as they speak into them. The king extends his hand towards Calumny, but his eyes look down so that he cannot see the scene.\r These identifications are clear from Lucian's description of a painting by Apelles, a Greek painter of the Hellenistic Period. Though Apelles' works have not survived, Lucian recorded details of one in his On Calumny:\n", "\nArtist: Sandro Botticelli\nArtwork Name: Last Communion of St Jerome\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/last-communion-of-st-jerome\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Last Communion of Saint Jerome is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli, finished around 1494\u20131495.

The choice of this scene, far less frequent than the usual depiction of Jerome in his studio, has been connected to Girolamo Savonarola's preaching in Florence at the time the work was executed; the latter's commissioner, identified by some scholars as the rich merchant Francesco del Pugliese, would be in fact a followed of the Ferrarese preacher.\r The topic was depicted by the baroque Bolognese painter Agostino Carracci in his painting now at the Galleria Nazionale of Bologna, and also by the Baroque painter Domenichino in a painting in the Vatican Museum.\n", "\nArtist: Sandro Botticelli\nArtwork Name: Annunciation\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/annunciation-1500\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Annunciation is a painting created by Italian Renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli.

The tondo, painted in Florence between the years of 1490 and 1500, addresses a central theme of the Italian Renaissance art: the divine motherhood. The work is currently housed in the S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art.\r The iconography of the Madonna with the infant Jesus is one of the most recurrent themes throughout art history. Its origin goes back to the hieratic representations of the High Middle Ages where Mary, crowned, enthroned or standing, presents the divine infant in her arms. The painters of the Italian Renaissance contributed to the widespread representation of the \"Virgin of Tenderness\", characterized by a more emotional and humane representation of this theme, rather than the strictly sacred approach given by the Byzantine art. In the words of Marcio Doctors, the Renaissance Madonnas mark \"the Renaissance spirit which it characterizes: faith in mankind, as subjectivity, placing it in the center of the world. Both the Renaissance and the maternal love embrace the man in the same way when they make the world revolve around him\".\r Botticelli produced a large number of Madonnas during the decades of 1480 and 1490. A considerable part consisted of tondi, in which the artist portrayed Mary, the Divine Child and the Infant Saint John the Baptist in worship. The tondi (tondo, singular) were works of art in circular shape (paintings or sculptures), mostly of sacred or historical themes. They were much appreciated in the 15th century and often ordered by patrons and guilds to decorate palaces or for use as objects of private devotion.\r The MASP painting is unanimously dated in the last decade of the 15th century, based on similarities with other works from this period, in which one perceives a change in pictorial style of the author. We emphasize the beautiful structure of the composition, in which the figures of the Virgin and Child stand boldly inside the tondo, hereby freeing himself from the elegant symmetry of his youth. The same compositional clearance can be noted in the details of the angled seat, upon which rests the book Magnificat, supported on the frame of the painting in an almost illusionist fashion. It is equally noteworthy the remarkable intensification of the emotional bond that unites Mary and baby Jesus, unusual in Madonnas executed by the painter in his youth.\r The Italian art historian Roberto Longhi notes that the drawing of the scene is structured through \"cross and radial lines\" and not by \"arching flexible lines\", which places the work in the aforementioned context of freer composition that marks the maturing style of the painter in the late 15th century. Antonino Santangelo emits a similar opinion, noting that the \"free and harmonious intertwining of hands and faces, mobility and precision recall the works of Botticelli shortly before 1500\".\r In fact, it is possible to list at least a dozen productions by Botticelli, all of the last decade of the century, similar in composition to the work of MASP, the closest being the tondo that is conserved at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts, identical to the title of this work and also dated around 1490.\n", "\nArtist: Sandro Botticelli\nArtwork Name: The Mystical Nativity\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/the-mystical-nativity-1500-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Mystical Nativity is a painting of circa 1500\u20131501 by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli, in the National Gallery in London. Botticelli built up the image using oil on canvas. It is his only signed work, and has an unusual iconography for a Nativity.\r The Greek inscription at the top translates as: \"This picture, at the end of the year 1500, in the troubles of Italy, I Alessandro, in the half-time after the time, painted, according to the eleventh [chapter] of Saint John, in the second woe of the Apocalypse, during the release of the devil for three-and-a-half years; then he shall be bound in the twelfth [chapter] and we shall see [him buried] as in this picture\". Botticelli believed himself to be living during the Tribulation, possibly due to the upheavals in Europe at the time, and was predicting Christ's Millennium as stated in Biblical text.\r It has been suggested that the painting may be connected with the influence of Savonarola, whose influence appears in a number of late paintings by Botticelli, though the contents of the image may have been specified by the person commissioning it. The painting uses the medieval convention of showing the Virgin Mary and infant Jesus larger both than other figures, and their surroundings; this was certainly done deliberately for effect, as earlier Botticellis use correct graphical perspective.\r The Mystical Nativity depicts a scene of joy and celebration, of earthly and heavenly delight, with angels dancing at the top of the painting. At the top of the painting stands Sandro Botticelli's name \u2013 but also the apocalyptic and troubling words. And there are dark premonitions \u2013 the helpless child rests on a sheet that evokes the shroud in which his body will one day be wrapped, while the cave in which the scene is set calls to mind his tomb. The Kings on the left bear no gifts, but their own devotion. At the top of the painting twelve angels dressed in the colours of faith, hope and charity dance in a circle holding olive branches, and above them heaven opens in a great golden dome, while at the bottom of the painting three angels embrace three men, seeming to raise them up from the ground. They hold scrolls which proclaim in Latin, \"peace on earth to men of goodwill\". Behind them seven devils flee to the underworld, some impaled on their own weapons. In Renaissance times Last Judgment paintings showed viewers the reckoning of the damned and the saved at the time of Christ's Second Coming. In echoing this kind of painting the Mystical Nativity is asking us to think not only of Christ's birth but of his return..\" (Jonathan Nelson, Syracuse University in Florence).\r The painting emerged from the city of Florence in a time when the fanatical preacher Savonarola held the city in its grip. He had arrived in Florence in 1490 but had been repelled by the artistic glory and enormous wealth that so impressed the world. He preached that this was a corrupt and vice-ridden place. A great scourge was approaching \u2013 and then his words had assumed a terrifying reality: the Italian War of 1494\u20131498. In 1494 a huge French army invaded Italy and 10,000 troops entered Florence so that the Florentines feared the King of France meant to sack the city. Savonarola stepped into the political vacuum, he met with the French king and persuaded him to leave Florence peacefully. In their gratitude and relief the Florentines increasingly saw the friar as a prophet and his preaching attracted huge crowds to Florence Cathedral. Savonarola claimed that Florence could become the new Jerusalem if the citizens would repent and abandon their sinful luxuries \u2013 and that included much of their art. His beliefs were made real as groups of evangelical youths went on to the streets to encourage people to part with their luxuries, their lewd pictures, and books, their vanities, combs, mirrors. Botticelli may well have seen his own paintings fed to the flames. Yet the artist might not have objected because, like much of the city, he too had come under the sway of Savonarola. It seems that a sermon preached by Savonarola bears directly upon the Mystical Nativity.\n", "\nArtist: Sandro Botticelli\nArtwork Name: The Story of Lucretia\nArtwork Genre: illustration\nArtwork Media: panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/the-story-of-lucretia-1504\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Tragedy of Lucretia is a tempera and oil painting on a wood cassone or spalliera panel by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli, painted between 1496 and 1504. Known less formally as the Botticelli Lucretia, it is housed in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of Boston, Massachusetts, having been owned by Isabella Stewart Gardner in her lifetime.\r The picture is a syncretion of scenes from different legendary themes in different time periods that Botticelli considered related. The topic is revolt against tyranny, a popular one in the volatile Italian republics. The main scene is given center foreground. It is the beginning of the revolution that created the Roman republic. The legend is that Lucretia, a noblewoman, was raped by the son of the last king of Rome, Sextus Tarquinius. As a result, Lucius Junius Brutus took an oath to expel the Tarquinii from Rome and never to allow anyone else to reign. In the centre of the picture Lucretia's corpse is on public display as a heroine. Brutus stands over her exhorting the populace to revolt and recruiting a revolutionary army of young men. There is much sword-waving. The dagger with which Lucretia killed herself is in evidence protruding from her breast. The statue at the top of the column behind Brutus in the foreground is David and Goliath's head, which is not very suitable for vengeance, but does fit the political situation. David and Goliath were a symbol of revolt against tyranny in the Republic of Florence. Lucretia had called for vengeance, but Brutus had called for the ouster of monarchy, and the purpose of the assembly was to implement it.\r The legendary funeral oration takes place in the Forum Romanum, but Botticelli makes no effort to represent that well-known place. The setting is a small town, which can be seen trailing into the countryside in the background; some speculate it may have been Collatia, but that place was hardly the scene of a national revolution. None of the buildings are classical Roman and even the triumphal arch in the background commemorating the triumph of the republic is unlike any other. Hilliard T. Goldfarb, author of The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum: A Companion Guide and History, instead suggests that it is a dramatic stage scene in which the players gesticulate theatrically, and also about Botticelli's intent to convey \"a clear political message.\" One does not. however, hire one of the greatest artists of the time to adorn the inside of a wedding chest or the back of a chair, even in a mansion, with clear political messages; presumably, the panel was meant for public display of some sort. Botticelli ten years later was to die in obscure and unappreciated poverty; nevertheless, he was recognized even then as a great master.\r The scene on the right porch is the death of Lucretia. The frieze over the porch depicts Horatius Cocles, a warrior who defended Rome against the intervention of Lars Porsenna and the ousted last king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. The scene on the left porch is the threatening of Lucretia by Sextus to extort her compliance. He rips away her cloak, offering to plunge his sword into her. The frieze over it depicts Judith and Holofernes, a tyrant decapitated by her after offers of seduction in the Old Testament.\n", "\nArtist: Sandro Botticelli\nArtwork Name: The Story of Virginia\nArtwork Genre: illustration\nArtwork Media: panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/the-story-of-virginia-1504\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Story of Virginia (Italian, Storie di Virginia), is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli.

For centuries, this was thought to be a self-portrait signature: however, starting from the 20th centuries the work was attributed, due to styilistical considerations, to Pietro Perugino (in particular, for the similitarities to the Portrait of Francesco delle Opere at the Uffizi), who had studied with Lorenzo in Verrocchio's workshop.\r The painter is portrayed from three-quarters, with a rocky and hilly landscape in the background. He wears a black berret and a blouse of the same color, the collar of a white shirt barely visible at the neck. The melancholic expression, as well as the black clothes, are perhaps connected to the death of the common master Verrocchio, which occurred in 1488.\n", "\nArtist: Pietro Perugino\nArtwork Name: Polyptych Albani Torlonia\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pietro-perugino/polyptych-albani-torlonia\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Albani Torlonia Altarpiece is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Pietro Perugino, executed in 1491 and housed in the Torlonia Collection, Rome.

In 1493 Perugino had married Chiara Fancelli, the daughter of architect Luca Fancelli: the face of the Madonna is a portrait of her.\r In 1786 the panel was acquired for 1000 Italian scudi by Peter Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany, becoming part of the future Uffizi Gallery. The original chapel was redecorated by a painting by Lorenzo di Credi; the one now in the church is a copy by Garibaldo Ceccarelli.\r It was restored in 1995.\r The background, this time featuring two bays, is one of the many porticoes painted by Perugino in the 1480s and 1490s (in works such as the Fano Altarpiece or the Piet\u00e0.

On the right is the common representation of St. Sebastian martyred by arrows, his contemplative gaze directed to the heavens.\r The composition was one of the first examples in Florence of the new style of Holy Conversation elaborated in Venice by Antonello da Messina and Giovanni Bellini a few years before, with a pyramidal development pivoting on the central figure of Mary on a high throne. The painting is also one of the first by Perugino in which the Madonna is no longer an elegant maid, but a more mature and severe woman, according to the more sober climate introduced in Florence by Girolamo Savonarola.

The work has been called \"one of the high points of European painting in the late 15th century.\"\r The painting shows St Bernard of Clairvaux, deep in his studies, being interrupted by a fully corporeal vision of the Virgin Mary, who appears to him in the clear light of day. Four saints surround them. There is a seemingly effortless, perfect symmetry about the composition, yet there is nothing static or artificial about it in any way. The position of the Virgin and St. Bernard's prie-dieu are both slightly off balance, but not enough to ruin the serene harmony of the picture. The faces of the various figures contribute to this quiet beauty, without showing much individualism or realism.

It returned to Italy in 1815, and thenceforth it has been exhibited at the Vatican Museums' art gallery.\r According to art historian Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle, Raphael, then an assistant of Perugino, had a major role in the execution of the Resurrection.

The lower part shows, above a landscape in the background, the open sarcophagus and several Roman soldiers, three of whom are sleeping and one awakened by the miracle. Another example of the scheme is the contemporary Transfiguration in the Collegio del Cambio in Perugia.\r The figure of Christ, holding the flag symbolic of the resurrection, has the typical harmony and softness of Perugino's mature works, with a detailed chest and a bright drapery with deep pleats. The two angels at his sides are symmetrical, and were obtained from the same cartoon (used by the artist and his workshop also in other works, such as the Madonna in Glory with Saints at Bologna).\r The sarcophagus has its cover correctly painted according to geometrical perspective.

It depicts the marriage between Joseph and Mary, and is now in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts of Caen, France. Initially commissioned to Pinturicchio for the recently completed cathedral of Perugia, Perugino took over the commission and finished the work around 1500-1504, probably after several periods of stasis. A very similar composition was painted by unknown artists (sometimes attributed to Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, probable teacher of Perugino or Rocco Zoppo, assistant of Perugino) for the church of San Girolamo in Spello in 1492. Which (if present scholarship is correct) is about ten years earlier than Perugino's and Raphael's treatments of the same subject. Composition is heavier since it does not show elegant central perspective appearing in Perugino's and later Raphael's more famous works. However the figures in the foreground are very similar to both later paintings, including the unmistakable young man breaking the rod.\r Later, in 1797, the picture was looted by Napoleon and was subsequently taken to Caen, Normandy. Attempts by the commune of Perugia, and the personal commitment of Antonio Canova, to retrieve the work failed.\r The wide perspective of the picture, with at its centre an octagonal edifice and the aligned composition of the figures on the sides, is strongly related to the Perugino's Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter at the Sistine Chapel. The painting prominently displays the Virgin's engagement ring, which was then kept at the cathedral as a holy relic.\r Raphael, Perugino's pupil, painted a version of his own of the picture in 1504.\n", "\nArtist: Pietro Perugino\nArtwork Name: Combat of Love and Chastity\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pietro-perugino/combat-of-love-and-chastity-1505\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Battle Between Love and Chastity is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Pietro Perugino, currently housed in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, in Paris, France.

The paintings of the Coronation of Isabella d'Este and Reign of Comus would be completed by Lorenzo Costa.\r The subject was suggested by Isabella's court poet, Paride da Ceresara, documented by the correspondence between Isabella and Perugino, who was then active in Florence. The notary contract included all the details about the literary theme, as well as a drawing which the work had to be based on. For example, when Perugino painted a naked Venus, instead than dressed, the marchesa protested vigorously.\r In 1505, when the painting was delivered, the marchesa was not entirely satisfied. She declared that she preferred it would have been painted in oil, instead of the tempera used under her directives in order to follow Mantegna's style. Perugino, who probably was not at ease with the small format of the work, received 100 ducats for the work.\r After the extinction of the Gonzaga dynasty, the painting was gifted by Charles I of Nevers to cardinal Richelieu, and was thus moved to Paris. Later it was acquired by the state and was added to the collection of the Louvre.\r The painting, over a background with gently steeped hills, portrays a fight between the symbolic figures of Love and Chastity. The theme was similar to other commissioned for the studiolo. Among the numerous mythological figures are Minerva, Diana, Venus, Anteros, nymphs, fauns and others.

The predella, painted by Bartolomeo di Giovanni, is in the same site.\r On 28 October 1485 Francesco di Giovanni Tesori, prior of the Ospedale degli Innocenti, Florence's orphanage, signed a detailed contract with Ghirlandaio regarding the commission of an altarpiece for the high altar of the annexed church of Santa Maria degli Innocenti. The subject chosen was the Adoration of the Magi, a common theme in the 15th century Florentine art. The contract specified that the master himself had to paint it (to avoid the frequent use he made of his workshop), according to a drawing approved by the commissioner and using precious colors. The work should be completed within thirty months, in reward of 115 florins.\r The original frame, commissioned in 1486 to Antonio di Francesco di Bartolo after a design by Giuliano da Sangallo, was destroyed in 1786, wen the interior of the church was renewed and the altarpiece removed. It was moved to the hospital's art gallery in 1917, being joined by the original predella (which had been separated in 1615) in 1971.\r This scene of the Adoration of the Magi expands upon earlier innovations by Sandro Botticelli Adoration of the Magi of Santa Maria Novella (c. 1475) and Leonardo da Vinci's Adoration of the Magi (1481-1482). The Madonna occupies a central position inside a pyramidal composition. The Child is held up to be seen by the Magi and the other spectators. Two Magi are positioned at the base of the composition, one kisses the child's foot, and another kneels with his hand on his chest. A third Magus stands on the left, wearing a yellow and red cloak, gifting a richly decorated chalice. According to the tradition, they represent three different ages of man: youth, maturity and old age. At their sides, crouched, are St. John the Baptist, who looks at the viewer and (in keeping with the contemporary theme) points to the Child; and St. John the Evangelist, who is presenting a wounded child. Another child, in a hint to the orphans (innocenti) cared by the Hospital, is at the opposite end. They are also referred to by the scene of the Massacre of the Innocents represented in the left background.\r The traditional ox and donkey surround the Virgin, together with St. Joseph. The hut includes an unfinished brick wall, a symbol of the decline of paganism, to be replaced by Christianism. The ceiling is supported by four columns decorated with candelabra and gilt Corinthian capitals. Above it, four angels hold a cartouche with a tetragram with the notes and the first words of the Gloria.\r Ghirlandaio painted in the left foreground a series of characters, among which are the donor (dressing in black), and the artist himself, who looks towards the viewer. On the right, in the Magi procession, are three richly donned men, which have been identified as major members of the Arte della Seta (Guild of the Silk Workers), the main financial backer of the Hospital. Above them, the procession continues in the far background, passing under an arch (with the date, MCCCCLXXXVIII, or 1488) another possible symbol of the fall of the transition between paganism and Christianism. The five horses were painted starting from only two cartoons, adding some small variants in the heads. The same sector of the background depicts the annunciation to the shepherds by a flying angel.

One of Ghirlandaio's best-known works, it is considered notable for its emotional poignancy. Its realism has been described as unique among the portraits of the Quattrocento.\r The picture portrays an older man in a red robe, embracing a young child who is also wearing red. They sit in an interior, illuminated against a darkened wall. Behind them at right is a window through which can be seen a generalized landscape, its uneven terrain and winding roads typical of Ghirlandaio's backgrounds. Although the man's fur-lined robe and cappuccio and the boy's elegant doublet and cap indicate a noble heritage, and despite the traditional assumption that the subjects are grandfather and grandson, their identities are unknown. It is possible that the painting was commemorative in purpose, and that the child was a narrative invention intended to emphasize the man's beneficence. The poignancy of the image is dramatized by the contrast between the man's weathered and wise face, and the child's delicate profile. While the composition is thematically related to portraiture from the Netherlands, by the mid-15th century the motif of a portrait in an interior with a landscape seen in the distance was common in Italy.\r An extraordinary feature of the painting is the deformity of the man's nose, evidence of rhinophyma. Ghirlandaio has presented the portrait in a naturalistic and sympathetic fashion, at variance with physiognomic theory of the era, which maintained a connection between external appearances and internal truths. Rather than implying a defect of character, An Old Man and his Grandson invites appreciation of the man's virtuousness. The painting depicts a moment of intimacy between an old man and a child, underscored by the placement of the child's hand on the man's chest, and the man's gentle expression. This show of affection endows the picture with emotional qualities beyond those expected from a traditional dynastic portrait. In the words of art historian Bernard Berenson, \"There is no more human picture in the entire range of Quattrocento painting, whether in or out of Italy.\"\r The painting's provenance is uncertain until 1880, when it entered the Louvre, and then only after it was rejected by the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin out of concern for its condition. Several commentators in the late 19th century reported that the picture had been abraded by overcleaning, and there were disfiguring scratches on the man's face. In 1996 the scratches and areas of discolored inpainting were removed, and the painting was cleaned and retouched.\r A drawing by Ghirlandaio entitled Head of an Old Man, once owned by Giorgio Vasari, portrays the same man as in the painting. The drawing may have been made while the sitter was asleep, or after his death, in which case it would have served as a graphic death mask.\n", "\nArtist: Domenico Ghirlandaio\nArtwork Name: The Visitation\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/domenico-ghirlandaio/the-visitation-1491\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Visitation is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Domenico Ghirlandaio, dating 1491. It is displayed in the Louvre Museum of Paris, France.\r The work was commissioned by Lorenzo Tornabuoni for the church later known as Santa Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi.\r The Visitation episode refers to the meeting between Mary and St. Elizabeth. It was set by Ghirlandaio with a large classical arch in the background featuring a landscape in the center. Elizabeth, wearing a wide yellow vest, is paying homage to Mary and kneeling.\r The paintings features numerous details, including the refraction effects of the light, which Ghirlandaio studied from Flemish paintings at Florence. Others include: the frieze decorated with pearls and shells (allusions to Mary's purity), the light veil of the Madonna, the gilt brooch decorated with pearls and a ruby in the center (this a hint to Jesus' future Passion) which holds her cloak. The Gabinetto dei Disegni e delle Stampe of the Uffizi houses a preparatory drawing of Mary's cloak.\r The two women at the sides are, as described by the inscriptions on the arch, Mary of Cleopas and Salome, whose presence hints to the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Salome's dress is a citation of Filippo Lippi's Bartolini Tondo, which was the inspiration for numerous similarly graceful figures in works by Ghirlandaio, Botticelli and others.\r Stylistic differences in the figures testifies the work of workshop assistants, perhaps Sebastiano Mainardi.

It is housed in the Uffizi gallery of Florence, Italy.\r The subject matter is drawn from Luke 1.26-39 and depicts the angel Gabriel, sent by God to announce to a virgin, Mary, that she would miraculously conceive and give birth to a son, to be named Jesus, and to be called \"the Son of God\" whose reign would never end. The subject was very popular for artworks and had been depicted many times in the art of Florence, including several examples by the Early Renaissance painter Fra Angelico. The details of its commission and its early history remain obscure.\r In 1867, following Gustav Waagen methods, Baron Liphart identified this Annunciation, newly arrived in the Uffizi Gallery from a convent near Florence, as by the young Leonardo, still working in the studio of his master Verrocchio. The painting has since been attributed to different artists, including Leonardo and Verrocchio's contemporary Domenico Ghirlandaio. It was more recently determined to be a collaboration between Leonardo and his master Verrocchio, with whom Leonardo collaborated on the Baptism of Jesus.\r The angel holds a Madonna lily, a symbol of Mary's virginity and of the city of Florence. It is supposed that Leonardo originally copied the wings from those of a bird in flight, but they have since been lengthened by a later artist.\r When the Annunciation came to the Uffizi in 1867, from the Olivetan monastery of San Bartolomeo, near Florence, it was ascribed to Domenico Ghirlandaio, who was, like Leonardo, an apprentice in the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio. In 1869, Karl Eduard von Liphart, the central figure of the German expatriate art colony in Florence, recognized it as a youthful work by da Vinci, one of the first attributions of a surviving work to the youthful Leonardo. Since then a preparatory drawing for the angel's sleeve has been recognized and attributed to Leonardo.\r Verrocchio used lead-based paint and heavy brush strokes. He left a note for Leonardo to finish the background and the angel. Leonardo used light brush strokes and no lead. When the Annunciation was x-rayed, Verrocchio's work was evident while Leonardo's angel was invisible.\r The marble table, in front of the Virgin, probably quotes the tomb of Piero and Giovanni de' Medici in the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence, which Verrocchio had sculpted during this same period. Some immature hesitancies are usually noted, especially the Virgin's ambiguous spatial relation to the desk and the marble on which it rests.\r On March 12, 2007, the painting was at the center of a furor between Italian citizens and the Minister of Culture, who decided to place the picture on loan to exhibit in Japan.\n", "\nArtist: Leonardo da Vinci\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Ginevra Benci\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/portrait-of-ginevra-benci\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGinevra de' Benci is a portrait painting by Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th-century Florentine aristocrat Ginevra de' Benci (born c.\u20091458). The oil-on-wood portrait was acquired by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1967. The sum of US$5 million\u2014an absolute record price at the time\u2014came from the Ailsa Mellon Bruce Fund and was paid to the Princely House of Liechtenstein. It is the only painting by Leonardo on public view in the Americas.\r Ginevra de' Benci, a well-known young Florentine woman, is universally considered to be the portrait's sitter. Leonardo painted the portrait in Florence between 1474 and 1478, possibly to commemorate Ginevra's marriage to Luigi di Bernardo Niccolini at the age of 16. The juniper bush that surrounds Ginevra's head and fills much of the background, serves more than mere decorative purposes. In Renaissance Italy, the juniper was regarded a symbol of female virtue, while the Italian word for juniper, ginepro, also makes a play on the sitter's name. The imagery and text on the reverse of the panel further support the identification of this picture. The reverse is decorated with a juniper sprig encircled by a wreath of laurel and palm and is memorialized by the phrase VIRTVTEM FORMA DECORAT (\"beauty adorns virtue\").\r The Latin motto VIRTVTEM FORMA DECORAT on the reverse of the portrait, is understood as symbolizing the intricate relationship between Ginevra's intellectual and moral virtue on the one hand, and her physical beauty on the other. The sprig of juniper, encircled by laurel and palm, suggests her name. The laurel and palm are in the personal emblem of Bernardo Bembo, a Venetian ambassador to Florence whose platonic relationship with Ginevra is revealed in poems exchanged between them. Infrared examination has revealed Bembo's motto \"Virtue and Honor\" beneath Ginevra's, making it likely that Bembo was somehow involved in the commission of the portrait.\r The portrait is one of the highlights of the National Gallery of Art, and is admired by many for its portrayal of Ginevra's temperament. Ginevra is beautiful, but austere; she has no hint of a smile and her gaze, although forward, seems indifferent to the viewer.\r A strip from the bottom of the painting was removed in the past, presumably owing to damage, and Ginevra's arms and hands were lost. Using the golden section, Susan Dorothea White has drawn an interpretation of how her arms and hands may have been positioned in the original. The adaptation is based on images of hands by Leonardo that are thought to have been executed as studies for this painting.\r For an unorthodox view on Ginevra de' Benci see Angelo Paratico Leonardo Da Vinci.

Some art historians discern the hands of other members of Verrocchio's workshop in the painting as well.   The picture depicts the Baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist as recorded in the Biblical Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke. The angel to the left is recorded as having been painted by the youthful Leonardo, a fact which has excited so much special comment and mythology, that the importance and value of the picture as a whole and within the \u0153uvre of Verrocchio is often overlooked. Modern critics also attribute much of the landscape in the background to Leonardo da Vinci as well. The painting is housed in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.   Andrea del Verrocchio was a sculptor, goldsmith and painter who ran a large and successful workshop in Florence in the second half of the 15th century. Among his apprentices and close associates were the painters Botticelli, Botticini, Lorenzo di Credi and Leonardo da Vinci.   Verrocchio was not himself a prolific painter and very few pictures are attributed to his hand, his fame lying chiefly in his sculptured works. Verrocchio's paintings, as are typical of Florentine works of that date, are in tempera on wooden panel. The technique of painting artworks in paint, previously used in Italy only for durable items like parade shields, was introduced to Florence by Dutch and Flemish painters and their imported works at around the date that this painting was created.  The painting The Baptism of Christ was, according to Antonio Billi (1515), commissioned by the Church of S. Salvi, and was later transferred to the Vallumbrosan Sisterhood in Santa Verdiana. In 1810 it entered the collection of the Accademia and passed to the Uffizi in 1959. In the 16th century the work was discussed in Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Painters in the biographies of both Verrocchio and Leonardo da Vinci.  A pupil in Verrocchio's workshop, Leonardo was asked to paint an angel in his master's composition. According to Vasari, this was so impressive that Verrocchio quit painting. Leonardo also likely painted much of the background landscape; it was painted in oil, like the angel, while the rest of the painting is in tempera.\n", "\nArtist: Leonardo da Vinci\nArtwork Name: Madonna with a Flower (Madonna Benois)\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/madonna-with-a-flower-madonna-benois\n\nWikipedia Article:\nMadonna and Child with Flowers, otherwise known as the Benois Madonna, could be one of two Madonnas Leonardo da Vinci had commented on having started in October 1478. The other one could be Madonna of the Carnation from Munich.\r It is likely that the Benois Madonna was the first work painted by Leonardo independently from his master Verrocchio. There are two of Leonardo's preliminary sketches for this piece in the British Museum. Studies of these sketches and the painting itself suggest that Leonardo was concentrating on the idea of sight. At that time it was thought that human eyes exhibited rays to cause vision with a central beam being the most important. The child is thought to be guiding his mother's hands into his central vision.\r The composition of Madonna and Child with Flowers proved to be one of Leonardo's most popular. It was extensively copied by young painters, including Raphael, whose own version of Leonardo's design (the Madonna of the Pinks) was acquired in 2004 by the National Gallery, London.\r For centuries, Madonna and Child with Flowers was considered lost. In 1909, the architect Leon Benois sensationally exhibited it in Saint Petersburg as part of his father-in-law's collection. The painting had been apparently brought from Italy to Russia by the notable connoisseur Aleksey Korsakov in the 1790s. Upon Korsakov's death, it was sold by his son to the Astrakhan merchant Sapozhnikov for 1400 roubles and so passed by inheritance to the Benois family in 1880. After many a squabble regarding attribution, Leon Benois sold the painting to the Imperial Hermitage Museum in 1914. The purchase was made by Ernst Friedrich von Liphart who was the curator of paintings who had correctly identified the artist. (Ernst's father Karl was an expert on Leonardo).\r Since 1914 the painting has been exhibited in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.\n", "\nArtist: Leonardo da Vinci\nArtwork Name: St. Jerome\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/st-jerome\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSt Jerome in the Wilderness (c. 1480) is an unfinished painting by Leonardo da Vinci, now in the Vatican Museums, Rome.\r The painting depicts Saint Jerome during his retreat to the Syrian desert, where he lived the life of a hermit. St Jerome kneels in a rocky landscape, gazing toward a crucifix which can be discerned faintly sketched in at the extreme right of the painting. In Jerome's right hand he holds a rock with which he is traditionally shown beating his chest in penance. At his feet is the lion which became a loyal companion after he extracted a thorn from its paw. The lion, the stone and a cardinal's hat are the traditional attributes of the saint.\r On the left-hand side of the panel the background is a distant landscape of a lake surrounded by precipitous mountains shrouded in mist. To the right-hand side, the only discernible feature is a faintly-sketched church, seen through the opening in the rocks. The church's presence may allude to Jerome's position in Western Christianity as one of the Doctors of the Church.\r The composition of the painting is innovative for the oblique trapezoid form of the figure of the saint. The angular forms contrast with the sinuous form of the lion which transcribes an \"S\" across the bottom of the painting. The form of St Jerome prefigures that of the Virgin Mary in the Virgin of the Rocks. The rendering of the muscles in the neck and shoulders is seen as the first of Leonardo's anatomical drawings.\r The panel has been reduced in size and the remaining part was cut in two at some point in its history and was reassembled for the early 19th-century collector, Cardinal Fesch, the uncle of Napoleon Bonaparte. Popular legend has it that the Cardinal discovered the part of the panel with the saint\u2019s torso being offered as a table-top in a shop in Rome. Many years later, he found another piece being used as a wedge for shoemaker\u2019s bench. Whatever the circumstances of Fesch's finding the parts, the repaired panel was sold by his descendants to Pope Pius IX, who installed it in the Pinacoteca Vaticana, now part of the Vatican Museums. The St. Jerome was once believed to have been part of the collection of the painter Angelica Kauffman, but this theory too has been rejected by recent scholars.\n", "\nArtist: Leonardo da Vinci\nArtwork Name: The Adoration of the Magi\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/the-adoration-of-the-magi-1480\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Adoration of the Magi is an early painting by Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo was given the commission by the Augustinian monks of San Donato a Scopeto in Florence, but he departed for Milan the following year, leaving the painting unfinished. It has been in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence since 1670.\r The Virgin Mary and Child are depicted in the foreground and form a triangular shape with the Magi kneeling in adoration. Behind them is a semicircle of accompanying figures, including what may be a self-portrait of the young Leonardo (on the far right). In the background on the left is the ruin of a pagan building, on which workmen can be seen, apparently repairing it. On the right are men on horseback fighting and a sketch of a rocky landscape.\r The ruins are a possible reference to the Basilica of Maxentius, which, according to Medieval legend, the Romans claimed would stand until a virgin gave birth. It is supposed to have collapsed on the night of Christ's birth (in fact it was not even built until a later date). The ruins dominate a preparatory perspective drawing by Leonardo, which also includes the fighting horsemen. The palm tree in the center has associations with the Virgin Mary, partly due to the phrase \"You are stately as a palm tree\" from the Song of Solomon, which is believed to prefigure her. Another aspect of the palm tree can be the usage of the palm tree as a symbol of victory for ancient Rome, whereas in Christianity it is a representation of martyrdom\u2014triumph over death\u2014so in conclusion we can say that the palm in general represents triumph. The other tree in the painting is from the carob family, the seeds from the tree are used as a unit of measurement. They measure valuable stones and jewels. This tree and its seeds are associated with crowns, suggesting Christ as the king of kings or the Virgin as the future queen of heaven, as well as that this is nature's gift to the new born Christ. As with Michelangelo's Doni Tondo, the background is probably supposed to represent the Pagan world supplanted by the Christian world, as inaugurated by the events in the foreground.The artist uses bright colors to illuminate the figures in the foreground of the painting. Jesus and the Virgin Mary are, in fact, painted yellow, the color of light. It is also interesting how the trees are painted blue, an unusual color for trees of any kind. On the right side the most credible self-portrait of Leonardo da Vinci as a 30-year-old can be seen, according to several critics. (See Angelo Paratico )\r Much of the composition of this painting was influenced by an earlier work of the Northern artist Rogier van der Weyden. The relationship between figures, space and the viewer\u2019s standpoint, the high horizon, slightly raised viewpoint, space receding into the far distance, and a central figural group poised before a rock formation in the middle of the landscape are all copied from van der Weyden's Entombment of Christ (1460, Uffizi Gallery, Italy).\n", "\nArtist: Leonardo da Vinci\nArtwork Name: The Madonna of the Carnation\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/the-madonna-of-the-carnation\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna of the Carnation, a.k.a.

It was probably painted in 1490.\r The man in the painting was at one time thought to be Franchino Gaffurio, who was the maestro di cappella of the Milanese Cathedral. Although some believe it to be a portrait of Gaffurio, others think the man is anonymous. The piece of paper he holds is at least one part of a musical score; it has notes written on it. The painting was greatly restored and repainted, and Leonardo probably left the portrait unfinished but close to completion.\r The man is positioned in a three-quarter position and he is holding a partition sheet. The musician stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision. Compared to the detailed face of the musician, the red hat, his tunic and his hair seem to be painted by a completely other painter.

It is also known as Portrait of an Unknown Woman. The painting's title, applied as early as the seventeenth century, identifying the sitter as the wife or daughter of an ironmonger (a ferronnier), was said to be discreetly alluding to a reputed mistress of Francis I of France, married to a certain Le Ferron. The tale is a romantic legend of revenge in which the aggrieved husband intentionally infects himself with syphilis, which he passes to the king through infecting his wife.\r Leonardo's Lady with an Ermine, has also been known by this name. This was once believed to be a portrait of Cecilia Gallerani\u2014one of the mistresses of Lodovico 'il Moro' Sforza, Duke of Milan. The narrative and the title were applied to Lady with an Ermine when it was in Princess Czartoryski's collection, and became confused with \"La Belle Ferronniere\" by the presence in this image also of a jewel worn on a delicate chain across the forehead, called a ferronni\u00e8re.\r Although the model of the painting \"La Belle Ferronniere\" is still shrouded in mystery, the landmark exhibition \"Leonardo Da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan\" (National Gallery, London, 9 Nov. 2011 \u2013 5 Feb. 2012) listed the portrait as possibly depicting Beatrice d'Este, wife of Ludovico Sforza. This challenges the portrait's earlier attribution to Lucrezia Crivelli, a mistress of Ludovico.\r Bernard Berenson attributed this portrait to Bernardino de' Conti. Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio was suggested by Herbert Cook, who retracted his opinion, seeing Leonardo's own hand, in 1904.\r A later version of the painting, on canvas, had been offered to the Kansas City Art Institute as the original, but was identified as a copy, on the basis of a photograph, by Sir Joseph Duveen, who permitted his remarks to be published in the New York World in 1920; the owner, Mrs Andr\u00e9e Lardoux Hahn, sued for defamation of property in a notorious court case, which involved many of the major connoisseurs of the day, inspecting the two paintings side by side at the Louvre; the case was eventually heard in New York before a jury selected for not knowing anything of Leonardo or Morellian connoisseurship, and settled for $60,000 plus court expenses, which were considerable. The owner's account, Harry Hahn's The Rape of La Belle (1946) is a classic of populist conspiracy theory applied to the art world. After decades in an Omaha vault, the Hahn La Belle was sold at auction by Sotheby's on January 28, 2010 as \"by a follower of Leonardo, probably before 1750\"; it brought 1.5 million dollars, a price three times higher than Sotheby's pre-sale estimate.

The subject of the portrait is Cecilia Gallerani, painted at a time when she was the mistress of Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, and Leonardo was in the service of the duke. The painting is one of only four portraits of women painted by Leonardo, the others being the Mona Lisa, the portrait of Ginevra de' Benci, and La belle ferronni\u00e8re. The painting was purchased in 2016 from the Czartoryski Foundation by the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage for the National Museum in Krak\u00f3w and has been on display in the museum's main building since 2017.\r The small portrait generally called The Lady with the Ermine was painted in oils on wooden panel. At the time of its painting, the medium of oil paint was relatively new to Italy, having been introduced in the 1470s.\r The subject has been identified with reasonable certainty as Cecilia Gallerani, who was the mistress of Leonardo's employer, Ludovico Sforza.\r Cecilia Gallerani was a member of a large family that was neither wealthy nor noble. Her father served for a time at the Duke's court. At the time her portrait was painted, she was about 16 years old and was renowned for her beauty, her scholarship, and her poetry. She was married at approximately age six to a young nobleman of the house of Visconti, but she sued to annul the marriage in 1487 for undisclosed reasons and the request was granted. Cecilia became the mistress of the Duke and bore him a son, even after his marriage to another woman 11 years previously, Beatrice d'Este. Beatrice was promised to the Duke when she was only 5, and married him when she was 16 in 1491. After a few months, she discovered the Duke was still seeing Cecilla, and forced the Duke to break off their relationship by marrying her off to a local count named Bergamino.\r The painting shows a half-length figure, the body of a woman turned at a three-quarter angle toward her right, but her face turned toward her left. Her gaze is directed neither straight ahead, nor toward the viewer, but toward a \"third party\" beyond the picture's frame. In her arms, Gallerani holds a small white-coated stoat, known as an ermine. Gallerani's dress is comparatively simple, revealing that she is not a noblewoman. Her coiffure, known as a coazone, confines her hair smoothly to her head with two bands of hair bound on either side of her face and a long plait at the back. Her hair is held in place by a fine gauze veil with a woven border of gold-wound threads, a black band, and a sheath over the plait.\r There are several interpretations of the significance of the ermine in her portrait. The ermine, a stoat in its winter coat, was a traditional symbol of purity because it was believed an ermine would face death rather than soil its white coat.

It is accompanied by notes based on the work of the architect Vitruvius. The drawing, which is in pen and ink on paper, depicts a man in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and inscribed in a circle and square. The drawing and text are sometimes called the Canon of Proportions or, less often, Proportions of Man. It is kept in the Gabinetto dei disegni e stampe of the Gallerie dell'Accademia, in Venice, Italy, under reference 228. Like most works on paper, it is displayed to the public only occasionally, so it isn't part of the normal exhibition of the museum. \r The drawing is based on the correlations of ideal human proportions with geometry described by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius in Book III of his treatise De architectura. Vitruvius described the human figure as being the principal source of proportion among the classical orders of architecture. Vitruvius determined that the ideal body should be eight heads high. Leonardo's drawing is traditionally named in honor of the architect.\r This image demonstrates the blend of mathematics and art during the Renaissance and demonstrates Leonardo's deep understanding of proportion. In addition, this picture represents a cornerstone of Leonardo's attempts to relate man to nature. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica online states, \"Leonardo envisaged the great picture chart of the human body he had produced through his anatomical drawings and Vitruvian Man as a cosmografia del minor mondo (cosmography of the microcosm). He believed the workings of the human body to be an analogy for the workings of the universe.\"\r According to Leonardo's preview in the accompanying text, written in mirror writing, it was made as a study of the proportions of the (male) human body as described in Vitruvius. The text is in two parts, above and below the image.\r The first paragraph of the upper part reports Vitruvius: \"Vetruvio, architect, puts in his work on architecture that the measurements of man are in nature distributed in this manner, that is:\r and these measurements are in his buildings\". The second paragraph reads: \"if you open your legs enough that your head is lowered by one-fourteenth of your height and raise your hands enough that your extended fingers touch the line of the top of your head, know that the centre of the extended limbs will be the navel, and the space between the legs will be an equilateral triangle\".\r The lower section of text gives these proportions:\r The points determining these proportions are marked with lines on the drawing. Below the drawing itself is a single line equal to a side of the square and divided into four cubits, of which the outer two are divided into six palms each, two of which have the mirror-text annotation \"palmi\"; the outermost two palms are divided into four fingers each, and are each annotated \"diti\".\n", "\nArtist: Leonardo da Vinci\nArtwork Name: The Last Supper\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: plaster,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/the-last-supper-1495\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Last Supper (Italian: Il Cenacolo [il t\u0283e\u02c8na\u02d0kolo] or L'Ultima Cena [\u02c8lultima \u02c8t\u0283e\u02d0na]) is a late 15th-century mural painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci housed by the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. It is one of the world's most recognizable paintings.  The work is presumed to have been started around 1495\u201396 and was commissioned as part of a plan of renovations to the church and its convent buildings by Leonardo's patron Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. The painting represents the scene of the Last Supper of Jesus with his apostles, as it is told in the Gospel of John, 13:21. Leonardo has depicted the consternation that occurred among the Twelve Disciples when Jesus announced that one of them would betray him.  Due to the methods used, a variety of environmental factors, and intentional damage, very little of the original painting remains today despite numerous restoration attempts, the last being completed in 1999.  The Last Supper measures 460\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a0880\u00a0cm (180\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a0350\u00a0in) and covers an end wall of the dining hall at the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. The theme was a traditional one for refectories, although the room was not a refectory at the time that Leonardo painted it. The main church building had only recently been completed (in 1498), but was remodeled by Bramante, hired by Ludovico Sforza to build a Sforza family mausoleum.   The painting was commissioned by Sforza to be the centerpiece of the mausoleum. The lunettes above the main painting, formed by the triple arched ceiling of the refectory, are painted with Sforza coats-of-arms.   The opposite wall of the refectory is covered by the Crucifixion fresco by Giovanni Donato da Montorfano, to which Leonardo added figures of the Sforza family in tempera. (These figures have deteriorated in much the same way as has The Last Supper.)   Leonardo began work on The Last Supper in 1495 and completed it in 1498\u2014he did not work on the painting continuously. The beginning date is not certain, as the archives of the convent for the period have been destroyed, and a document dated 1497 indicates that the painting was nearly completed at that date.   One story goes that a prior from the monastery complained to Leonardo about the delay, enraging him. He wrote to the head of the monastery, explaining he had been struggling to find the perfect villainous face for Judas, and that if he could not find a face corresponding with what he had in mind, he would use the features of the prior who complained.  The Last Supper specifically portrays the reaction given by each apostle when Jesus said one of them would betray him. All twelve apostles have different reactions to the news, with various degrees of anger and shock.

The drawing is in charcoal and black and white chalk, on eight sheets of paper glued together. Because of its large size and format the drawing is presumed to be a cartoon for a painting. No painting by Leonardo exists that is based directly on this cartoon.\r The drawing depicts the Virgin Mary seated on the knees of her mother St Anne and holding the Child Jesus while St. John the Baptist, the cousin of Jesus, stands to the right. It currently hangs in the National Gallery in London. It was either executed in around 1499\u20131500, at the end of the artist's first Milanese period, or around 1506\u20138, when he was shuttling between Florence and Milan; the majority of scholars prefer the latter date, although the National Gallery and others prefer the former.\r The subject of the cartoon is a combination of two themes popular in Florentine painting of the 15th century: The Virgin and Child with John the Baptist and The Virgin and Child with St Anne.\r The drawing is notable for its complex composition, demonstrating the alternation in the positioning of figures that is first apparent in Leonardo's paintings in the Benois Madonna. The knees of the two women point different directions, with Mary's knees turning out of the painting to the left, while her body turns sharply to the right, creating a sinuous movement. The knees and the feet of the figures establish a strong up-and-down rhythm at a point in the composition where a firm foundation comprising firmly planted feet, widely spread knees and broad spread of enclosing garment would normally be found. While the lower halves of their bodies turn away, the faces of the two women turn towards each other, mirroring each other's features. The delineation between the upper bodies has lost clarity, suggesting that the heads are part of the same body.\r The twisting movement of the Virgin is echoed in the Christ Child, whose body, held almost horizontal by his mother, rotates axially, with the lower body turned upward and the upper body turned downward. This turning posture is first indicated in Leonardo's painting in the Adoration of the Magi and is explored in a number of drawings, in particular the various studies of the Virgin and Child with a cat that are in the British Museum.\r The juxtaposition of two sets of heads is an important compositional element. The angle, lighting and gaze of the Christ Child reproduces that of his mother, while John the Baptist reproduces these same elements in the face of St Anne. The lighting indicates that there are two protagonists, and two supporting cast in the scene that the viewer is witnessing. There is a subtle interplay between the gazes of the four figures. St Anne smiles adoringly at her daughter Mary, perhaps indicating not only maternal pride but also the veneration due to the one who \"all generations will call...blessed\". Mary's eyes are fixed on the Christ Child who raises his hand in a gesture of benediction over the cousin who thirty years later would carry out his appointed task of baptising Jesus. Although the older of the two children, John the Baptist humbly accepts the blessing, as one who would later say of his cousin \"I am not worthy even to unloose his sandals.\"  St Anne's hand, her index finger pointing towards the Heaven, is positioned near the heads of the children, perhaps to indicate the original source of the blessing. This enigmatic gesture is regarded as quintessentially Leonardesque, occurring in The Last Supper and St John the Baptist.\n", "\nArtist: Leonardo da Vinci\nArtwork Name: Salvator Mundi\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/salvator-mundi-1500\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSalvator Mundi is a painting of Christ as Salvator Mundi (Latin for Savior of the World) by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, dated to c.\u20091500. The painting shows Jesus, in Renaissance dress, giving a benediction with his right hand raised and two fingers extended, while holding a transparent rock crystal orb in his left hand, signaling his role as savior of the world and master of the cosmos, and representing the 'crystalline sphere' of the heavens, as it was perceived during the Renaissance. Around 20 other versions of the work are known, by students and followers of Leonardo. Preparatory chalk and ink drawings of the drapery by Leonardo are held in the Royal Collection.\r Long thought to be a copy of a lost original, veiled with overpainting, it was restored, rediscovered, and included in a major Leonardo exhibition at the National Gallery, London, in 2011\u201312. Although several leading scholars consider it to be an original work by Leonardo da Vinci, this attribution has been disputed by other specialists.\r It is one of fewer than 20 known works by Leonardo, and was the only one to remain in a private collection. It was sold at auction by Christie's in New York to Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Mohammed Al Farhan on behalf of the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture & Tourism on 15 November 2017, for $450.3\u00a0million, setting a new record for most expensive painting ever sold. The painting is to be on display at the Louvre Abu Dhabi.\r Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi may have been painted for Louis XII of France and his consort, Anne of Brittany. It was probably commissioned around 1500, shortly after Louis conquered the Duchy of Milan and took control of Genoa in the Second Italian War. Leonardo himself moved from Milan to Florence in 1500.\r It may have come to England with Henrietta Maria when she married Charles I of England in 1625, and it seems to have remained in her private chambers at the Queen's House in Greenwich. Wenceslaus Hollar made an engraving of the painting, published in Antwerp in 1650 with the inscription Leonardus da Vinci pinxit (Latin for 'Leonardo da Vinci painted it').\r Charles I was executed in 1649 at the end of the English Civil War, and the painting was included in a 1649 inventory of the Royal Collection, valued at \u00a330. Charles\u2019s possessions were sold under the English Commonwealth, and the painting was sold in 1651 to John Stone, a mason, to settle a debt, but it was returned to Charles II of England after the English Restoration in 1660, and included in an inventory of Charles\u2019s possessions at the Palace of Whitehall in 1666. It was inherited by James II of England and may then have passed to his mistress Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester, whose illegitimate daughter with James became the third wife of John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby. His own illegitimate son, Sir Charles Herbert Sheffield, 1st Baronet, auctioned the painting in 1763 along with other artworks from Buckingham House, when the building was sold to George III.\n", "\nArtist: Leonardo da Vinci\nArtwork Name: Leda and the Swan\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: chalk,ink,paper,wash\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/leda-and-the-swan-1506\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe story of Leda and the Swan was the subject of two compositions by Leonardo da Vinci from perhaps 1503-10. Neither survive as paintings by Leonardo, but there are a number of drawings for both by him, and copies in oils, especially of the second composition, where Leda stands.\r Leonardo began making studies in 1504 for a painting, apparently never executed, of Leda seated on the ground with her children. Three sketches of Leda by Leonardo exist:\r A completed copy of Leda and her Children by Giampietrino is kept at Staatliche Museen, Kassel (c.\u00a01520, oil on wood, 128 x 106\u00a0cm).\r In 1508 Leonardo painted a different composition of the subject. The picture known as Leda and the Swan depicted a nude standing Leda cuddling the swan, with the two sets of infant twins, and their huge broken egg-shells. The original of this is lost, probably deliberately destroyed, and was last recorded in the French royal Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau in 1625 by Cassiano dal Pozzo:\r A standing figure of Leda almost entirely naked, with the swan at her and two eggs, from whose broken shells come forth four babies, This work, although somewhat dry in style, is exquisitely finished, especially in the woman's breast; and for the rest of the landscape and the plant life are rendered with the greatest diligence. Unfortunately the picture is in a bad state because it is done on three long panels which have split apart and broken off a certain amount of paint.\r However the picture is known from many copies, of which the earliest are probably the Spiridon Leda, perhaps by a studio assistant and now in the Uffizi, and the one at Wilton House in England.

It was created in the art period high renaissance. It is perhaps the same work that Ippolito Calandra, in 1531, suggested to hang in the bedroom of Margaret Paleologa, wife of Federico II Gonzaga. In 1501, the marquesses wrote to Pietro Novellara asking if Leonardo could paint a Madonna for her private studiolo.\r Part of the Parmesan collection since 1839, the painting has been dated to Leonardo's mature period, around the time of Virgin of the Rocks or The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist.\r Alexander Nagel wrote of the painting: \"The eyes do not focus on any outward object, and they give the impression that they will remain where they are: they see through the filter of an inner state, rather than receive immediate impressions from the outside world.

Leonardo was recorded as being at work on one such picture in Florence in 1501 for Florimond Robertet, a secretary to King Louis XII of France. This may have been delivered to the French court in 1507, though scholars are divided on this point. The subject is known today from several versions of which two, called the Buccleuch Madonna and the Lansdowne Madonna, are thought to be partly by Leonardo\u2019s hand. The underdrawings of both paintings show similar experimental changes made to the composition (or pentimenti), suggesting that both evolved concurrently in Leonardo\u2019s workshop.\r The composition shows the Virgin Mary seated in a landscape with the Christ child, who gazes at a yarnwinder used to collect spun yarn. The yarnwinder serves both as a symbol of Mary's domesticity and as a foreshadowing of the Cross on which Christ was crucified. The painting's dynamic composition and implied narrative was highly influential on later High Renaissance depictions of the Madonna and Child by artists such as Raphael and Andrea del Sarto.\r The earliest reference to a painting of this subject by Leonardo is in a letter of 14 April 1501 by Fra Pietro da Novellara, the head of the Carmelites in Florence, to Isabella d'Este, Marchioness of Mantua. Leonardo had recently returned to his native city following the French invasion of Milan in 1499; the intervening years he had spent first in Isabella\u2019s court, during which brief stay he produced a cartoon (now in the Louvre) for a portrait of her, and then in Venice. Isabella was determined to get a finished painting by Leonardo for her collection, and to that end she instructed Fra Pietro, her contact in Florence, to press Leonardo into agreeing to a commission. Two letters of reply by the friar survive. In the second, written after he had succeeded in meeting with the artist, he writes that Leonardo has become distracted by his mathematical pursuits and is busy working on a small painting for Florimond Robertet, which he goes on to describe:\r The passage is valuable for being one of the few descriptions by a contemporary viewer of a work by Leonardo; it matches the composition of the Buccleuch and Lansdowne Madonnas in all respects except that there is no basket in either painting. Robertet\u2019s painting was probably commissioned late in 1499 just before Leonardo left Milan, and was possibly begun there.\r Scholars disagree on whether Robertet received his painting or not. In January 1507 Francesco Pandolfini, the Florentine ambassador to the French court in Blois, reported that \u201ca little picture by [Leonardo\u2019s] hand has recently been brought here and is held to be an excellent thing\u201d. The Madonna does not, however, appear in a posthumous inventory of Robertet\u2019s collection made in 1532 (though the authenticity of the inventory has been called into question). One hypothesis holds that it passed from Robertet\u2019s collection into that of the French king, thus explaining its absence from the inventory. It is unclear, however, why it would have left the royal collection.\n", "\nArtist: Leonardo da Vinci\nArtwork Name: St. John the Baptist\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/st-john-the-baptist\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSt. John the Baptist is a High Renaissance oil painting on walnut wood by Leonardo da Vinci. Probably completed from 1513 to 1516, it is believed to be his final painting. The original size of the painting was 69 x 57 cm. It is now exhibited at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in Paris, France.\r The piece depicts St. John the Baptist in isolation. Through the use of chiaroscuro, the figure appears to emerge from the shadowy background. St. John is dressed in pelts, has long curly hair and is smiling in an enigmatic manner reminiscent of Leonardo's famous Mona Lisa. He holds a reed cross in his left hand while his right-hand points up toward heaven like St Anne in Leonardo's Burlington House Cartoon. According to Z\u00f6llner, Leonardo's use of sfumato \"conveys the religious content of the picture,\" and that \"the gentle shadows imbue the subject's skin tones with a very soft, delicate appearance, almost androgynous in its effect, which has led to this portrayal being interpreted as an expression of Leonardo's homoerotic leanings.\"\r Kenneth Clark claimed that for Leonardo, St. John represented \"the eternal question mark, the enigma of creation\", and noted the sense of \"uneasiness\" that the painting imbues. Barolsky adds that: \"Describing Saint John emerging from the darkness in almost shockingly immediate relation to the beholder, Leonardo magnifies the very ambiguity between spirit and flesh. The grace of Leonardo's figure, which has a disturbingly erotic charge, nonetheless conveys a spiritual meaning to which Saint John refers when he speaks of the fullness of grace from God.\"\r The dating of St. John the Baptist is disputed. It was seen by Antonio de Beatis in Leonardo's workshop at Clos Luc\u00e9; his diary entry giving a terminus ante quem of 17\u00a0October 1517.\r Traditionally the painting has been considered the artist's last and dated to 1513-16; Leonardo's sfumato technique here being considered to have reached its apogee. Some experts, however, have compared the hand of St. John to a similar work by a pupil in the Codex Atlanticus, dating the commencement of the picture to around 1509.\r St. John the Baptist was apparently part of King Francis' collection at Fontainebleu in 1542. In 1625 King Charles I received the painting from Louis XIII in return for a Titian Holy Family and Holbein's Portrait of Erasmus. In 1649 Charles' collection was sold, whereupon the painting entered into the hands of banker Eberhard Jabach. After a spell in the possession of Cardinal Mazarin, in 1661 the piece once again returned to the King of France \u2013 Louis XIV. Following the revolution the painting entered the collection at the Louvre where it remains to this day.\r Prior to this work, St. John had traditionally been portrayed as a gaunt ascetic. Leonardo's innovative depiction proved influential upon Raphael's workshop; several portraits of St. John painted around 1517-18 attributed to Raphael and Giulio Romano show a similarly youthful saint in isolation, with a strong contrast between the dark background and the illumination of the figure.\r Numerous copies and variations of St. John the Baptist made by Leonardeschi exist.\n", "\nArtist: Leonardo da Vinci\nArtwork Name: The Virgin and Child with St. Anne\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/the-virgin-and-child-with-st-anne-1510\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Virgin and Child with Saint Anne is an oil painting by Leonardo da Vinci depicting St Anne, her daughter the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus. Christ is shown grappling with a sacrificial lamb symbolizing his Passion as the Virgin tries to restrain him. The painting was commissioned as the high altarpiece for the Church of Santissima Annunziata in Florence and its theme had long preoccupied Leonardo.\r In 1498, Leonardo probed into incorporating these figures together by drawing the Burlington House Cartoon (National Gallery). In 2008, a curator at the Louvre discovered several faint sketches believed to have been made by Leonardo on the back of the painting. Infrared reflectography was used to reveal a \"7-by-4 inch drawing of a horse's head\", which had a resemblance to sketches of horses that da Vinci had made previously before drawing The Battle of Anghiari. Also revealed was a second sketch 6\u200b1\u20442 inch-by-4\u00a0inch depiction of half a skull. A third sketch showed the infant Jesus playing with a lamb, which sketch was similar to that which is painted on the front side. The Louvre spokesperson said that the sketches were \"very probably\" made by Leonardo and that it was the first time that any drawing had been found on the \"flip side of one of his works\". The drawings will be further studied by a group of experts as the painting undergoes restoration.\r Leonardo's painting is at once both pleasing, calm yet confusing upon closer examination. The composition of the three figures is fairly tight, with the Virgin Mary clearly interacting actively with the infant Jesus. Upon closer examination of their positioning it is apparent that Mary is sitting on St Anne's lap. It is unclear what meaning this could have and what meaning Leonardo intended to project with that pose. There is no clear parallel in other works of art and women sitting in each other's lap are not a clear cultural or traditional reference that the viewer can relate to. Additionally, although the exact sizes of neither the Mother Virgin nor St Anne are known, it can be extrapolated from the painting that St Anne is a significantly larger person than Mary. This subtle yet perceptible distortion in size was utilized by Leonardo to emphasize the mother daughter relationship between the two women despite the apparent lack of visual cues to the greater age of St Anne that would otherwise identify her as the mother. The child is holding a lamb. we also see that Mary is staring into her child's eyes but st Anne is staring at Mary. As Mary is sitting on her lap and St Anne is staring at the virgin Mary Leonardo was maybe trying to point a message across about their relationship and personalities.\r Sigmund Freud undertook a psychoanalytic examination of Leonardo in his essay Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood. According to Freud, the Virgin's garment reveals a vulture when viewed sideways. Freud claimed that this was a manifestation of a \"passive homosexual\" childhood fantasy that Leonardo wrote about in the Codex Atlanticus, in which he recounts being attacked as an infant in his crib by the tail of a vulture. Freud translated the passage thus:\"It seems that I was always destined to be so deeply concerned with vultures\u2014for I recall as one of my very earliest memories that while I was in my cradle a vulture came down to me, and opened my mouth with its tail, and struck me many times with its tail against my lips.\"\n", "\nArtist: Leonardo da Vinci\nArtwork Name: Mona Lisa\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel,poplar,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/mona-lisa\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Mona Lisa (/\u02ccmo\u028an\u0259 \u02c8li\u02d0s\u0259/; Italian: Monna Lisa [\u02c8m\u0254nna \u02c8li\u02d0za] or La Gioconda [la d\u0292o\u02c8konda], French: La Joconde [la \u0292\u0254k\u0254\u0303d]) is a half-length portrait painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci that has been described as \"the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world\". The Mona Lisa is also one of the most valuable paintings in the world. It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known insurance valuation in history at $100 million in 1962, which is worth nearly $800 million in 2017.\r The painting is thought to be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, and is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. It had been believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. Recent academic work suggests that it would not have been started before 1513. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic, on permanent display at the Louvre Museum in Paris since 1797.\r The subject's expression, which is frequently described as enigmatic, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the continuing fascination and study of the work.\r The title of the painting, which is known in English as Mona Lisa, comes from a description by Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari, who wrote \"Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife.\" Mona in Italian is a polite form of address originating as \"ma donna\" \u2013 similar to \"Ma\u2019am\", \"Madam\", or \"my lady\" in English. This became \"madonna\", and its contraction \"mona\". The title of the painting, though traditionally spelled \"Mona\" (as used by Vasari), is also commonly spelled in modern Italian as Monna Lisa (\"mona\" being a vulgarity in some Italian dialects) but this is rare in English.\r Vasari's account of the Mona Lisa comes from his biography of Leonardo published in 1550, 31 years after the artist's death. It has long been the best-known source of information on the provenance of the work and identity of the sitter. Leonardo's assistant Sala\u00ec, at his death in 1524, owned a portrait which in his personal papers was named la Gioconda, a painting bequeathed to him by Leonardo.\r That Leonardo painted such a work, and its date, were confirmed in 2005 when a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume written by the ancient Roman philosopher Cicero. Dated October 1503, the note was written by Leonardo's contemporary Agostino Vespucci. This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo.\r In response to the announcement of the discovery of this document, Vincent Delieuvin, the Louvre representative, stated \"Leonardo da Vinci was painting, in 1503, the portrait of a Florentine lady by the name of Lisa del Giocondo. About this we are now certain. Unfortunately, we cannot be absolutely certain that this portrait of Lisa del Giocondo is the painting of the Louvre.\"\n", "\nArtist: Pinturicchio\nArtwork Name: The Crucifixion with Sts.

The theme has hidden philosophical and humanist meanings, perhaps suggested by the literates which formed the cardinal's court.\r In the center is the genealogical tree of the Della Rovere with two peacocks, which can be seen also at the corners. One of the representation is a nude allegory of Fortune, which rides a dolphin, differently from the contemporary Florentine depictions in which she is portrayed on a small boat.

The Weighing of the Soul and the Eagle Defeating the Snake are ancient themes which had been syncretized by the Christian world.\r Numerous depictions are of sea creatures, including sirens with two tails, painted while milking, leading pups, painting or executing acrobatic dances.

The painting was long considered as the work of the artist's collaborators, due to the presence of 19th century repainting and yellowing: however, later restoration showed the delicate quality of the work and the sumptuousness of the style, typical of Pinturicchio.\r The painting is derived from the Madonna with Writing Child (c. 1494-1498), which also shows the child in philosopher's garments, standing on a stool (with the Borgia coat of arms), writing on a book which the Virgin is giving to him. This work adds the portrait of the commissioner, painted in profile, kneeling on the right, a position already used by Pinturicchio in the Madonna of the Peace (c. 1490). Jesus wears a dalmatic and a pallium, perhaps inspired by local late Antique and medieval mosaics, different from the thin veils which were typical of the contemporary Umbrian and Tuscan schools.\r The use of a Gothic golden background and the flowers were adaptations to the taste of the commissioner.

It is in the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9 in Chantilly, France.\r Simonetta Vespucci was a Genoese noblewoman who married Marco Vespucci of Florence at the age of either 15 or 16, and who was renowned for being the greatest beauty of her age - certainly of the city of Florence. She was admired by all of Florence for her beauty, which later became a legend after her premature death in 1476 at the age of 23. Sandro Botticelli was inspired by her features in The Birth of Venus and Piero di Cosimo was a passionate admirer.\r The subject is a young girl portrayed at half length in profile, facing left. Her breasts are bared and a small snake twines around the necklace she is wearing. In the background is an open landscape, arid on the left and lush on the right. The dark clouds are a symbol of her early death, as is the dead tree in the background. At the base of the painting is a border with an inscription that mimics carved letters, a method used in art since the Flemish painter Jan van Eyck at the beginning of the century; it reads: SIMONETTA IANUENSIS VESPUCCIA.\r The dark clouds contrast with the pure profile of the face and the clear complexion. It is traditionally identified as a portrait of Simonetta. Giorgio Vasari regarded her as portraying Cleopatra, because of the toplessness and the snake, which he identified with the asp with which, according to Plutarch, Cleopatra committed suicide. However, the art historian Norbert Schneider regards it as more likely that the iconography of the portrait derives from that in late Classical antiquity, in which the snake, especially biting its own tail, symbolized the cycle of time and hence rejuvenation, and was thus associated with Janus, the Roman god of the new year, and with Saturn, who became a \"Father Time\" figure because his Greek name, Kronos, was conflated with Chronos, meaning \"time\". The inscription refers to Simonetta as Januensis (of Genoa, but the variant spelling punning on Janus). The snake was also the symbol of Prudentia; in that interpretation, it would be praise for Simonetta's wisdom.\r An alternative suggestion is that she is presented as Proserpina, with the snake symbolizing the pagans' hope of resurrection.\r The bust, in 15th-century style, is slightly turned towards the spectator, so as to favour the view, and her shoulders are wrapped in a richly embroidered cloth. According to Schneider, her naked breasts would not have caused any offense to contemporary viewers. They were rather an allusion to Venus Pudica, or the \"chaste\" Venus, and in Paris Bordone's allegories of lovers (c. 1550) toplessness is a symbol of the wedding.\r Her features have a surprising purity. The forehead is high, according to the fashion of the time which included a shaved hairline. The hairstyle is that of a married woman, gathered up in braids and richly decorated with ribbons, beads, and pearls.\n", "\nArtist: Piero di Cosimo\nArtwork Name: Perseus Rescuing Andromeda\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/piero-di-cosimo/perseus-rescuing-andromeda-1510\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPerseus Freeing Andromeda is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Piero di Cosimo, c. executed in 1510 or 1513 It is housed in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, Italy.\r The painting is mentioned in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari, who states that it was commissioned by Filippo Strozzi the Elder, and gifted by Giovanni Battista Strozzi to a member of Cosimo I de' Medici's personnel.\r The work shows the mythological hero Perseus killing the monster who had entrapped Andromeda.

The top portion of the panel, called Hunting on the Lagoon is in the Getty Museum, and another matching panel is missing. The painting was formerly considered to show two courtesans. Modern art historians think them more likely members to be of the patrician Torella family, as suggested by their fine clothes and the pearl necklaces, but academic debate continues, as with other similar Venetian paintings of the period. Several objects - the white kerchief, the pearls and the animals (the doves, Venus's bird) are symbols of chastity. Note the chopines, or platform clogs, on the left.\r Another painted panel, now in the Getty Museum [1], was published in 1944, and it was later realized that this is part of the same work, fitting above this part: it portrays several boats in a lagoon, and would explain the meaning of the scene, as two women awaiting their husbands' return after an expedition hunting, or fishing with cormorants, in the Venetian lagoon.[2] This discovery was verified by an in depth technical analysis, comparing the two fragmentary panels. Another panel the same size as these two combined would have been on the left; probably the two were hinged together to make a diptych, or a folding door or shutter. The Getty panel has an illusionistic letter rack painted on the back of the panel, which was presumably matched on this panel.

The commission included a total of nine large canvasses, by prominent artists of the time such as Bellini, Perugino, Vittore Carpaccio, Giovanni Mansueti, Lazzaro Bastiani and Benedetto Rusconi.\r The subject of the paintings was to be the miracles of a fragment of the True Cross.

The work began in 1502 and was completed in 1507.\r The painting shows the first of the three episodes dedicated to St. George's life: the other two are the Triumph of St. George and the Baptism of the Selenites. St. George is portrayed while riding a horse above a wide background, his lance piercing the dragon's head. On the right is a praying princess. A diagonal line connects the princess head, passing through the lance, to the twisted tail of the dragon.\r The arid terrain of a desert, with a few bunches of herbs, is covered with the remains of the dragon's victims: the scrawny stump of a woman, a half-devoured dress, a man with amputated limbs, a severed foot and arm, skulls and bones, both of animals and humans. The inhospitality of the place is further enhanced by the presence of vipers, lizards, toads, vultures, as well by the nearly monocromatic use of yellow and pale greens: the only bright tones are those associated with George's metal armor, the horse's harness and the princess' dress.\r In the background is a fantastic city, Silene of Libya. A crowd is looking at the scene from terraces and open pavilions. The hills, featuring castles and rocky spurs, slope down to a harbor where are a grounded ship and a vessel crowned by a natural arch of edifices, which has parallels with fantastic creations in the Ferrara school.\n", "\nArtist: Vittore Carpaccio\nArtwork Name: Portrait of a Knight\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/vittore-carpaccio/portrait-of-a-knight-1510\n\nWikipedia Article:\nYoung Knight in a Landscape, or Portrait of a Knight, is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Vittore Carpaccio, now in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection in Madrid. Dated 1510, this is the earliest full-length portrait in Western painting\u2014on the assumption that it is a portrait, as seems likely. It is characteristic of Carpaccio that apart from this important innovation, the style of the work seems in other respects to look back to the previous century. From some date until the 20th century the painting had been given the monogram of Albrecht D\u00fcrer, and Carpaccio's signature overpainted. The realism and detail of Carpaccio does in fact show Northern influence.\r The painting shows a young knight, surrounded by a rather crowded series of symbols. The heron caught in the sky by a hawk might hint at this knight's death in battle, also alluded to by his posture, which recalls that of a funerary statue; an alternative theory is that this is a memorial portrait of a person already dead. The other knight with a lance might then be the same person during his life. In the left lower corner is a white ermine and a scroll stating \"I prefer to die rather than to incur dishonour\" (malo mori quam foedari). The symbolism of these and the other animals and plants have been much discussed by art historians.\r For centuries the identity of the knight has been a subject of discussion among the most renowned art historians, including Bernard Berenson and Lionello Venturi. The portrait is now considered most likely to show Francesco Maria I della Rovere, the Duke of Urbino and nephew of Pope Julius II, during whose reign it was painted. Nevertheless, a more recent interpretation identifies the knight as the Venetian patrician Marco Gabriel, who was rector of the fortress of Methoni, in Greece, during the Ottoman siege of 1500. His family would have commissioned the painting as a tribute to his memory, as, being the only Venetian survivor of the siege, he had been accused of cowardice. Taken by the Ottomans to Constantinople, he was beheaded there on 4 November 1501.\r The painting was sold by the heirs of the American collector Otto Kahn after his death and bought by Heinrich Thyssen in 1935.\n", "\nArtist: Michelangelo\nArtwork Name: The Torment of Saint Anthony\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo/the-torment-of-saint-anthony\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Torment of Saint Anthony is the earliest known painting by Michelangelo, painted after an engraving by Martin Schongauer when he was only 12 or 13 years old. It is currently in the permanent collection of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. It shows the common medieval subject, included in the Golden Legend and other sources, of Saint Anthony being assailed in the desert by demons, whose temptations he resisted; the Temptation of St Anthony (or \"Trial\") is the more common name of the subject. But this composition shows a later episode where St Anthony, normally flown about the desert supported by angels, was ambushed in mid-air by devils.\r The painting was previously attributed to the workshop of Domenico Ghirlandaio, under whom Michelangelo had served his apprenticeship. Under that attribution it was bought at a Sotheby's auction in July 2008 by an American art dealer for US$2 million. When the export license was obtained that September, it was brought to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where it was cleaned of discoloured varnish and later overpainting and closely examined for the first time. On the basis of stylistic hallmarks such as \"emphatic cross hatching\", it was decided that the painting was indeed by Michelangelo. It was soon bought by the Kimbell Art Museum for an undisclosed amount, believed to be in excess of $6 million.\r Giorgio Vasari in his Lives of the Artists noted that Michelangelo had painted St. Anthony after a print by Schongauer, and Ascanio Condivi recorded that Michelangelo had gone to a market to draw fish scales, a feature not present in the original engraving. Besides this enhancement, Michelangelo also added a landscape below the figures, and altered the expression of the saint.\r It is one of only four surviving panel paintings by Michelangelo, whom Vasari records as speaking disparagingly of oil painting in later life, and the only one, if the new attribution holds, from his adolescence. Schongauer's late-Gothic style is also in strong contrast with the rest of Michelangelo's oeuvre, even in his youth. The prints of Schongauer, just reaching the end of his short life when Michelangelo copied him, were widely distributed in Europe, including Italy.\n", "\nArtist: Michelangelo\nArtwork Name: The Entombment\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: tempera,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo/the-entombment\n\nWikipedia Article:\nCoordinates: 51\u00b030\u203232\u2033N 0\u00b007\u203240\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff51.509009\u00b0N 0.127741\u00b0W\ufeff / 51.509009; -0.127741\r The Entombment is an unfinished painting of the placing of the body of Jesus in the garden tomb, now generally attributed to the Italian Renaissance master Michelangelo Buonarroti and dated to around 1500 or 1501. It is in the National Gallery in London, which purchased the work in 1868 from Robert Macpherson, a Scottish photographer resident in Rome who, according to various conflicting accounts, had acquired the painting there some 20 years before.\r The chronological position of this work has been the source of some dispute, although it is generally considered an early work. Some authorities believe that it may have been executed by one of Michelangelo's pupils from a drawing by the master or was a direct imitation of his work.\r According to documents discovered in 1981, Michelangelo had been commissioned to paint a panel for the church of Sant'Agostino in Rome, but in the end gave back the sum received. It is probable that this work was the Entombment, which remained unfinished upon Michelangelo's return to Florence.\r There is an anecdote that Michelangelo received a letter from his father saying that he should abandon whatever he was doing because a great piece of marble had arrived for him, which would become his David sculpture.\r The centre of the panel portrays Christ being carried up a flight of steps to the sepulchre, which was intended to be painted in the blank area at the top right of the work. The bearded older man behind him is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who gave up his tomb for use as Christ's sepulchre. The long-haired figure on the left is probably Saint John, wearing a long orange-red gown, with one of the Marys (possibly Mary Magdalene) kneeling at his feet.\r The identity of the two figures on the right is uncertain. Suggested identities for the elongated inner figure range from Nicodemus to one of the Marys, while the figure on the far right may be Mary Salome. The large unfinished area at the bottom right was intended to be used for the kneeling form of the Virgin Mary.\r The floating appearance of some of the figures may be partly explained by the fact that the painting is intended to be viewed from below, and to the fact that it is unfinished. However, the apparent incongruity of the stance of the bearer on the right remains problematical.\r Many of the unfinished parts of the painting, such as the cloak of the missing Virgin, would have required quantities of the expensive lapis lazuli blue. If this was in short supply, it could be that this would have held up completion of the painting, which may explain why it was unfinished. However, even if this were so, it would not explain why the artist could not have completed the many other parts of the painting that did not require any blue.\n", "\nArtist: Michelangelo\nArtwork Name: David\nArtwork Genre: sculpture\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo/david-1504\n\nWikipedia Article:\nDavid is a masterpiece of Renaissance sculpture created in marble between 1501 and 1504 by the Italian artist Michelangelo. David is a 5.17-metre (17.0\u00a0ft) marble statue of a standing male nude. The statue represents the Biblical hero David, a favoured subject in the art of Florence.   David was originally commissioned as one of a series of statues of prophets to be positioned along the roofline of the east end of Florence Cathedral, but was instead placed in a public square, outside the Palazzo Vecchio, the seat of civic government in Florence, in the Piazza della Signoria where it was unveiled on September 8, 1504. The statue was moved to the Galleria dell'Accademia, Florence, in 1873, and later replaced at the original location by a replica.  Because of the nature of the hero it represented, the statue soon came to symbolize the defence of civil liberties embodied in the Republic of Florence, an independent city-state threatened on all sides by more powerful rival states and by the hegemony of the Medici family. The eyes of David, with a warning glare, were turned towards Rome.  The history of the statue begins before Michelangelo's work on it from 1501 to 1504. Prior to Michelangelo's involvement, the Overseers of the Office of Works of Florence Cathedral, consisting mostly of members of the influential woolen cloth guild, the Arte della Lana, had plans to commission a series of twelve large Old Testament sculptures for the buttresses of the cathedral. In 1410 Donatello made the first of the statues, a figure of Joshua in terracotta. A figure of Hercules, also in terracotta, was commissioned from the Florentine sculptor Agostino di Duccio in 1463 and was made perhaps under Donatello's direction. Eager to continue their project, in 1464, the Operai contracted Agostino to create a sculpture of David. A block of marble was provided from a quarry in Carrara, a town in the Apuan Alps in northern Tuscany. Agostino only got as far as beginning to shape the legs, feet and the torso, roughing out some drapery and probably gouging a hole between the legs. His association with the project ceased, for reasons unknown, with the death of Donatello in 1466, and ten years later Antonio Rossellino was commissioned to take up where Agostino had left off.  Rossellino's contract was terminated soon thereafter, and the block of marble remained neglected for 26 years, all the while exposed to the elements in the yard of the cathedral workshop. This was of great concern to the Opera authorities, as such a large piece of marble not only was costly but represented a large amount of labour and difficulty in its transportation to Florence. In 1500, an inventory of the cathedral workshops described the piece as \"a certain figure of marble called David, badly blocked out and supine.\" A year later, documents showed that the Operai were determined to find an artist who could take this large piece of marble and turn it into a finished work of art. They ordered the block of stone, which they called The Giant, \"raised on its feet\" so that a master experienced in this kind of work might examine it and express an opinion. Though Leonardo da Vinci and others were consulted, it was Michelangelo, only 26 years old, who convinced the Operai that he deserved the commission. On 16 August 1501, Michelangelo was given the official contract to undertake this challenging new task. He began carving the statue early in the morning on 13 September, a month after he was awarded the contract. He would work on the massive statue for more than two years.\n", "\nArtist: Michelangelo\nArtwork Name: Battle of Cascina (Copy by Michelangelo's pupil Aristotele da Sangallo)\nArtwork Genre: battle painting,history painting\nArtwork Media: fresco\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo/battle-of-cascina-copy-by-michelangelos-pupil-aristotele-da-sangallo-1506\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Battle of Cascina is a never-completed artwork commissioned for creation by Michelangelo for the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. He created only the preparatory drawing before being called to Rome by Pope Julius\u00a0II, where he worked on the Pope's tomb; before completing this project, he returned to Florence for some months to complete the cartoon.  The work was commissioned from Michelangelo by Piero Soderini, statesman of the Democratic of Florence. It was intended for a wall of the Salone dei Cinquecento in the Palazzo Vecchio. The opposite wall was to be decorated by Leonardo da Vinci, who was commissioned to depict the Battle of Anghiari. The two battles were notable medieval Florentine victories. The Battle of Cascina was fought on 28 July 1364 between the troops of Florence and Pisa, resulting in victory of the former. A thousand Pisans were killed and two hundred more were captured.  Michelangelo never completed the painting, but did produce a complete cartoon of the composition. The cartoon was copied by several artists, the most notable extant copy being by Michelangelo's pupil Sangallo. Some of Michelangelo's preparatory drawings also survive, along with prints of part of the scene by Marcantonio Raimondi. According to Michelangelo's biographer Giorgio Vasari, the original cartoon was deliberately destroyed by Michelangelo's rival Bartolommeo Bandinelli because he was jealous of its fame; this occurred in 1512 upon the return of the Medici.  Michelangelo depicted a scene at the beginning of the battle, when the Florentine army was initially taken by surprise in the attack by the Pisans. He depicts Florentine soldiers bathing naked in the river Arno, responding to a trumpet warning of the Pisan attack. As the soldiers emerge from the river and buckle on their armour, they are threatened by shots from the Pisans. Several soldiers look or point toward the Pisan position to the left. One soldier has apparently been hit and fallen back into the river, while others leap energetically into action.  By choosing this episode, Michelangelo could depict his favoured topic: the nude male figure in various postures.\n", "\nArtist: Michelangelo\nArtwork Name: Sistine Chapel Ceiling: Creation of Adam\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: fresco\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo/sistine-chapel-ceiling-creation-of-adam-1510\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Creation of Adam (Italian: Creazione di Adamo) is a fresco painting by Italian artist Michelangelo, which forms part of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling, painted c. 1508\u20131512. It illustrates the Biblical creation narrative from the Book of Genesis in which God gives life to Adam, the first man. The fresco is part of a complex iconographic scheme and is chronologically the fourth in the series of panels depicting episodes from Genesis.  The image of the near-touching hands of God and Adam has become iconic of humanity. The painting has been reproduced in countless imitations and parodies. Michelangelo's Creation of Adam is one of the most replicated religious paintings of all time.  In 1505 Michelangelo was invited back to Rome by the newly elected Pope Julius II. He was commissioned to build the Pope's tomb, which was to include forty statues and be finished in five years.  Under the patronage of the Pope, Michelangelo experienced constant interruptions to his work on the tomb in order to accomplish numerous other tasks. Although Michelangelo worked on the tomb for 40 years, it was never finished to his satisfaction. It is located in the Church of S. Pietro in Vincoli in Rome and is most famous for his central figure of Moses, completed in 1516. Of the other statues intended for the tomb, two known as the Rebellious Slave and the Dying Slave, are now in the Louvre.  During the same period, Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, which took approximately four years to complete (1508\u20131512). According to Condivi's account, Bramante, who was working on the building of  St Peter's Basilica, resented Michelangelo's commission for the Pope's tomb and convinced the Pope to commission him in a medium with which he was unfamiliar, in order that he might fail at the task.  Michelangelo was originally commissioned to paint the Twelve Apostles on the triangular pendentives that supported the ceiling, and cover the central part of the ceiling with ornament. Michelangelo persuaded Pope Julius to give him a free hand and proposed a different and more complex scheme, representing the Creation, the Fall of Man, the Promise of Salvation through the prophets, and the genealogy of Christ.

The Sistine Chapel is in Vatican Palace, in the Vatican City. Elements of this fresco have inspired various artists, including Caravaggio and Norman Rockwell in his famous Rosie the Riveter illustration.  This particular fresco figure is painted fourth on the right from the side of the High Altar. Michelangelo's imagining bursts with movement, as Isaiah's cloak swirls around him. The colors in the portrayal \u2013 especially after the restoration \u2013 strike us as cool and luminous. The figure holds a distinctive blue book to his side, perhaps a depiction of the biblical Book of Isaiah.  This painting has been held in particularly high regard by critics. Vasari said of it: \"Anyone who studies this figure, copied so faithfully from nature, the true mother of the art of painting, will find a beautifully composed work capable of teaching in full measure all the precepts to be followed by a good painter\". If compared to Raphael's imagining of the same figure, Michelangelo's portrayal seems far more fluid and less muscular, as well as brighter in color.\n", "\nArtist: Michelangelo\nArtwork Name: The Creation of Adam (detail)\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo/the-creation-of-adam-detail-1512\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Creation of Adam (Italian: Creazione di Adamo) is a fresco painting by Italian artist Michelangelo, which forms part of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling, painted c. 1508\u20131512.

Julius absolved him and Alfonso spent a few days in Rome before returning to Ferrara. On 11 July he visited the Sistine Chapel, where Michelangelo was completing the ceiling. As he climbed the scaffolding he had a long and admiring conversation with Michelangelo, who promised him a painting.\r Several years passed without the commission being formalised until Michelangelo had to be in Ferrara in 1529 to inspect its city walls as \"governor general of fortifications\" for the Florentine Republic, ready for an expected Imperial siege. On that occasion the Duke held Michelangelo to his promise and according to Condivi and Vasari he produced the work when he returned to Florence in August 1530 after the city's fall, perhaps using the time he had to spend in hiding. It was a square work in tempera, representing Jupiter as a swan making love to a reclining Leda (based on an composition from ancient Roman gems and seals), an egg and Castor and Pollux as children.\r It was completed by mid-October 1530 but Alfonso described it as a \"little thing\" in Michelangelo's hearing and so he refused to hand it over. The work and some of the preparatory drawings were in fact acquired (either as a purchase or a gift) by Antonio Mini, who took it to France in 1531. In 1532 he left it to Francis I of France, who later sent it to the Palace of Fontainebleau. The best known copy is attributed to Rosso Fiorentino and hangs in the National Gallery in London, with others in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie (Dresden), the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie (Berlin) and the Correr Museum in Venice. The Casa Buonarroti in Florence holds not only a copy but also a preparatory drawing of Leda's head, held to be by Michelangelo himself. There are also several prints of the work, the most faithful of which is thought to be the one by Nicolas B\u00e9atrizet, which also shows Castor and Pollux.\n", "\nArtist: Michelangelo\nArtwork Name: The Deposition\nArtwork Genre: sculpture\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo/pieta\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Deposition (also called the Bandini Piet\u00e0 or The Lamentation over the Dead Christ) is a marble sculpture by the Italian High Renaissance master Michelangelo. The sculpture, on which Michelangelo worked between 1547 and 1555, depicts four figures: the dead body of Jesus Christ, newly taken down from the Cross, Nicodemus (or possibly Joseph of Arimathea), Mary Magdalene and the Virgin Mary. The sculpture is housed in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo in Florence and is therefore also known as the Florentine Piet\u00e0.  According to Vasari, Michelangelo made the Florence Piet\u00e0 to decorate his tomb in Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. He later sold it however, prior to completion of the work after intentionally damaging Christ's left arm and leg and removing several components for reasons still under debate. Some experts believe it was because the marble was flawed and the sculpture could not be completed without the addition of a piece of marble from another block (\"piecing\").  Vasari noted that Michelangelo began to work on the sculpture around the age of 72. Without commission, Michelangelo worked tirelessly into the night with just a single candle to illuminate his work. Vasari wrote that he began to work on this sculpture to amuse his mind and to keep his body healthy. After 8 years of working on it, Michelangelo would go on and attempt to destroy the work in a fit of frustration. This marked the end of Michelangelo's work on the sculptural group, which found itself in the hands of Francesco Bandini, who hired an apprentice sculptor, by the name of Tiberio Calcagni, to restore the work to its current composition. The left leg of Christ is missing. Since its inception, the sculpture has been plagued by ambiguities and never ending interpretations, with no straightforward answers available.  The face of Nicodemus under the hood is considered to be a self-portrait of Michelangelo himself.  The composition of this work has caused controversy and debate since its creation. Art historians have argued back and forth about what scene or scenes are being presented as well as the true identity of the hooded figure encapsulating the scene. Though it is regarded as a Piet\u00e0 out of tradition, there is substantial evidence that suggest that this work could either be a deposition, a Piet\u00e0, an entombment, or perhaps a scene that depicts all three. The only way to truly know which scenes or scenes are being depicted lies within the identity of the hooded figure.  The identities of other three figures in this work are relatively clear. The body of Christ just after his crucifixion in the middle, being assisted by a distraught Virgin Mary to his left and a cold and distant Mary Magdalene to his right. All three of the known figures are in some way helped by the hooded figure in supporting Christ's body. The hooded figure can be one of two people, or even both. Historians argue that the figure can either be Joseph of Arimathea or Nicodemus, the latter of which is most generally accepted. Conventionally speaking, Joseph of Arimathea is usually shown with a beard and broods over Christ's head, just like the figure in this here. On the other hand, this figure could be Nicodemus who is typically shown with some type of head covering, which would be the hood in this case. Both Joseph and Nicodemus had significant roles in Christ's final days and the subsequent actions after his death. Joseph gave up his own tomb for Christ to use and he helped remove Christ's body from the cross. Nicodemus moreover, had a conversation with Christ about how one could be born again and obtain eternal life. From that conversation on, Nicodemus became involved with Christ and also aided Joseph of Arimathea in Christ's deposition. Since both Joseph and Nicodemus were involved in the deposition, there is a strong argument that that is the scene being shown, so much so that to some, this work is known as The Deposition. Christ's serpentine shaped body sulks heavily in the arms of his loved ones as if he was in the process of descending from the cross straight into his mother's arms. The pained expression on the Virgin's face would resemble the look on her face upon first seeing her dead child with surrounding figures being there to support her.\n", "\nArtist: Giorgione\nArtwork Name: The Three Ages of Man\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione/the-three-ages-of-man-1501\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Three Ages of Man or Reading a Song is a 1500-01 painting by Giorgione, now displayed at the Galleria Palatina within the Palazzo Pitti in Florence.\n", "\nArtist: Giorgione\nArtwork Name: Judith\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione/judith\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJudith is a painting by the Italian painter Giorgione, executed around 1504. It is one of the few authentic works by Giorgione owned by the Russian Hermitage Museum. The painting, originally attributed to Raphael, came to the Hermitage in 1772 from Paris. Like many other paintings, it refers to the Judith and Holofernes motif.\r In the late 19th century, a thick layer of dark yellow varnish covered Judith, which completely distorted the original painting; in addition, restorations conducted at different times had falsified the artist's intentions. In 1839 the Hermitage restorer A. Sidorov accurately transferred the painting from panel to canvas. In 1967 it was decided to clean it, and the task was entrusted to A.M. Malova, a highly qualified restorer under the supervision of A.V. Brianzev, head of the easel paintings restoration workshop. General control consisted of experts from Leningrad and Moscow.\r The painting was first thoroughly studied with UV rays and binocular microscope. UV and infrared images were taken, as well as X-rays. The examination showed that most of the damage was on the grass, ground and trunk. The old repaints covered broader areas than was necessary to restore the inflicted areas. The varnish was removed with a cotton tampon wetted in a special solution; other additional material was cleaned out using a very sharp scalpel under a microscope. Between two and six cm\u00b2 of original painting was restored per day\r The restoration was finished in 1971.

Originally commissioned by the Venetian noble Gabriele Vendramin, the painting is now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia of Venice, Italy. Despite considerable discussion by art historians, the meaning of the scene remains elusive.\r On the right a woman sits, suckling a baby. The woman has been described as a \"Gypsy\" since at least 1530, and in Italy, the painting is also known as La Zingara e il Soldato (\"The Gypsy woman and the soldier\"), or as La Zingarella e il Soldato (\"The Gypsy girl and the soldier\"). Her pose is unusual - normally the baby would be held on the mother's lap; but in this case the baby is positioned at the side of the mother, so as to expose her pubic area. A man, possibly a soldier, holding a long staff or pike, stands in contrapposto on the left. He smiles and glances to the left, but does not appear to be looking at the woman. Art historians have identified the man alternatively as a soldier, a shepherd, a gypsy, or a member of a club of unmarried men. X-rays of the painting have revealed that in the place of the man, Giorgione originally painted another female nude. One may also note the stork on the rooftop on the right. Storks sometimes represent the love of parents for their children.\r The painting's features seem to anticipate the storm. The colors are subdued and the lighting soft; greens and blues dominate. The landscape is a not a mere backdrop, but forms a notable contribution to early landscape painting. The painting has a 'silent' atmosphere which continues to fascinate modern viewers.\r There is no contemporary textual explanation for The Tempest, and ultimately, no definitive reading or interpretation. To some it represents the flight into Egypt; to others, a scene from classical mythology (possibly Paris and Oenone; or Iasion and Demeter) or from an ancient Greek pastoral novel. According to the Italian scholar Salvatore Settis, the desert city would represent the Paradise, the two characters being Adam and Eve with their son Cain: the lightning, as in ancient Greek and Hebrew times, would represent God who has just ousted them from Eden. Others have proposed a moral allegorical reading, or concluded that Giorgione had no particular subject in mind.\r This was Lord Byron's favorite painting because the ambiguity of both its subject matter and symbolism allowed viewers to make up their own tale.\r Jan Morris wrote that the picture changed the way she looked at painting. She was fascinated with the subject and \"its sense of permanently suspended enigma\", and calls it a \"haunted picture\", inhabited by the actual presence of the artist.\r Czech poet Ladislav Nov\u00e1k wrote a poem called Giorgione's Tempest where Meister Eckhart explains its symbolism in a wealthy man's study. According to him, the man is a shepherd who represents Giorgione and the lady is a woman the painter loves, without hoping his love will be requited.\n", "\nArtist: Giorgione\nArtwork Name: The Three Philosophers\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione/the-three-philosophers-1509\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Three Philosophers is an oil painting on canvas attributed to the Italian High Renaissance artist Giorgione. It shows three philosophers - one young, one middle-aged, and one old. The work was commissioned by the Venetian noble Taddeo Contarini, a Venetian merchant with an interest in the occult and alchemy. The Three Philosophers was finished one year before the painter died. One of Giorgione\u2019s last paintings, it is now displayed at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The painting was finished by Sebastiano del Piombo.\r The Three Philosophers was finished around 1509, and the current name of the work derives from a writing of Marcantonio Michiel, (1484\u20131552) who saw it just some years after in a Venetian villa. The three figures portrayed are allegorical: an old bearded man, possibly a Greek philosopher; an Arab philosopher; and a sitting young man, enclosed within a natural landscape. In the background is a village with some mountains, the latter marked by a blue area whose meaning is unknown. The young man is observing a cave on the left of the scene, and apparently measuring it with some instruments. Since the end of the 19th century scholars and critics rejected on various grounds the earlier view that it is a representation of the three Magi gathered before Jesus' grotto.\r Various interpretations about Giorgione's picture have been proposed. The Three Philosophers, the old man, the Arab figure and the young man, could be a depiction of transmission of knowledge, the Transmission of the Classics from the ancient Greeks philosophy through the Arab translations, that became actual again around the Italian Renaissance. The old man is representing a Greek philosopher, such as Plato or Aristotle, whose writings have been copied and transmitted through the Arab philosophers to the Italian Renaissance. The Arab philosopher is possibly representing the polyhistor Avicenna or Averroes, both Arab philosophers and Arab scientists from the Islamic Golden Age.\r The young man could be seen as the new Renaissance science with roots in the past, looking into the empty darkness of the cave, symbolizing the yet undiscovered secrets. The cave might also symbolize the philosophic concept of Plato's Cave\r New hypotheses about the figures, their identities and the symbolism are still currently advanced. In a note about the picture G. C. Williamsom, early in the 20th century, stated that \"It represents Evander and his son Pallas showing to Aeneas the future site of Rome\". The possibility that the three men are King Solomon, Hiram I, King of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff has been advanced by Neil K. MacLennan and Ross S. Kilpatrick.\r It has been suggested that the figure of the young man can be inscribed neatly in a right-angled triangle for which the Pythagorean theorem applies. Karin Zeleny, relying on a reading of Polydore Vergil has proposed that the philosophers are the teachers of Pythagoras - Pherecydes of Syros and Thales. Thales has been painted as a Jew, while Pherecydes was mistakenly believed to be a Syrian. This interpretation was modified by Frank Keim who claimed that the older philosopher is in fact Aristarchus of Samos\n", "\nArtist: Giorgione\nArtwork Name: The Adoration of the Shepherds\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione/the-adoration-of-the-shepherds-1510\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Adoration of the Shepherds, sometimes still known as the Allendale Nativity, after a former owner, is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Giorgione, completed in about 1505 to 1510. The attribution is now usual, although not universal; the usual other view is that it is an early Titian. It is certainly a Venetian painting of that period. It is displayed in the National Gallery of Art of Washington, D.C., United States.\r A group of paintings is sometimes described as the \"Allendale group\", after the Allendale Nativity. This group includes another Washington painting, the Holy Family, and an Adoration of the Magi predella panel in the National Gallery, London. This group, now often expanded to include another Adoration of the Shepherds in Vienna, and sometimes further, are usually included (increasingly) or excluded together from Giorgione's oeuvre.\r Giorgione portrayed the main scene on the right, in front of a dark grotto, while on the left is bright landscape crowned by trees. A sincere dramatic tension is obtained by the choice to place the kneeling shepherd pilgrims in the centre of the painting. The entire group of parents, child, and pilgrim form an anchored rectangle that forms a counterpoised focal point to the receding landscape on the left.\r This work was probably completed by Giorgione while he was part of the workshop of Vincenzo Catena, a strict follower of Giovanni Bellini's style.\r It was owned by Cardinal Joseph Fesch (1763\u20131839) and sold at the Palazzo Ricci, Rome on 18 March 1845 (lot 874) as Adoration des bergers by \"Giorgon (Giorgio Barbarelli dit le)\" for 1,760 scudi (\u00a3370.53 at a rate of 4.75 scudi to the pound). The Cardinal was an uncle of Napoleon and a collector of gargantuan proportions. The sale of 17 and 18 March featured 1,837 pictures; the Louvre had 1,406 at the time. The collection included Fra Angelico's Last Judgement and Poussin's A Dance to the Music of Time.\r It was next owned by Claudius Tarral of Paris and sold at his sale at Christie's, London on 11 June 1847 (lot 55) as Adoration of the Shepherds by Giorgione. The sale featured 55 pictures and fetched \u00a33,383. The Giorgione sold for 1,470 guineas (\u00a31,544). This large sum relative to the sale total and the fact that it was the last lot cried indicates that it was the premier item of the sale.\r It was at the 1847 sale that the painting came into the ownership of Thomas Wentworth Beaumont (1792\u20131848) of Bretton Hall, West Yorkshire, England. From him it passed to Wentworth Blackett Beaumont, 1st Baron Allendale (1829-1907), to his son, Wentworth Beaumont, 1st Viscount Allendale [1860-1923] and to his son, Wentworth Beaumont, 2nd Viscount Allendale (1890-1956).\r Joseph Duveen concluded negotiations to acquire the Nativity from Lord Allendale on 5 August 1937. It was acquired by Duveen Brothers at, according to Duveen's colleague Edward Fowles, \"a Giorgione price\" ($315,000 and $5,000 to dealer Charles Ruck). Duveen's expert, art historian Bernard Berenson fervently believed the painting to be early Titian, and a battle of wills ensued. The Allendale Nativity ultimately caused the rupture between Lord Duveen and Berenson, ending one of the most influential relationships in modern art history. Duveen sold the painting, as a Giorgione, to Samuel Kress, the department-store magnate, for $400,000 in 1938. He displayed the Nativity in the window of his store on Fifth Avenue during the Christmas season of that year.\n", "\nArtist: Giorgione\nArtwork Name: Self-portrait\nArtwork Genre: self-portrait\nArtwork Media: paper\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione/self-portrait-1510\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Self-portrait of Giorgione is a 1510 self-portrait by the Italian painter Giorgione.

The former is associated to the allegory of Virtue, featuring a putto playing with books (a symbol of wisdom) and the symbols of the Liberal Arts.\r The right half shows a drunk silenus, sleeping among the symbols of vice; to these, in the background, corresponds a valley with an easy access, but dark and including a forest, which is a symbol of getting lost without the divine light, as well as a boat sinking in a lake, a symbol of failure.\r The theme is perhaps derived from an engraving by Albrecht D\u00fcrer, which also includes a similar tree with moral symbols.\n", "\nArtist: Lorenzo Lotto\nArtwork Name: Portrait of a Young Man\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/lorenzo-lotto/portrait-of-a-young-man-1505\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of a Young Man is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Lorenzo Lotto, executed around 1506 and housed in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, Italy.\r The work was part of cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici's collection, after he had bought it from the Cornaro family.

The work is dated and signed Laurent[ius] Lotus MDVIII.\r Lotto began to work on the piece in 1506 as a devotional for the church of San Domenico in Recanati. The work was seen and described complete and in situ by Giorgio Vasari in his Vite, who said Lotto was still young and followed partly the manner of the Bellini, partly that of Giorgione. By 1861, the polyptych was disassembled, but was later recomposed and transferred to the Communal Art Gallery. San Domenico still contains a Lotto fresco depicting St Vincent Ferrer.\r The polyptych includes a larger altarpiece in the center, flanked by two smaller ones in the same shape. At the top are two side panels with Saints, and a top rectangular one depicting the Piet\u00e0. The polyptych scheme, related to a 15th-century old fashioned scheme, was perhaps chosen by the friars of the convent: Lotto anyway developed it into a single composition, at least in the lower panels, with a scene set under a loggia with a coffered barrel vault in center and two minor vaults at the sides, while in the background is a landscape representation.\r The niches in the background, featuring Byzantine-style mosaics, are inspired by earlier works by Giovanni Bellini, while the checkrboard pavement is an example of knowledge of the geometrical perspective introduced by the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century.\r The panels are:\r The presence of Dominican saints is connected to the order who held the church, while Flavian and Vitues are the patrons saints of Recanati. Saint Dominic himself is portrayed in the central panel while receiving the white scapular from the Virgin.

It was first mentioned in a 1693 document, when it was already part of the Borghese Collection.\r The painting uses the Holy Conversation composition, with the Madonna and Child in the center between two saints, a scheme widely used by Giovanni Bellini and other Venetian painters of the time.\r It depicts, on a dark background, a thoughtful Madonna. The Child is rather fat, and is trying to reach St. Flavian of Ricina, painted on the left. The latter is offering Jesus a pierced heart, a symbol of the future Passion. The identification of Flavian, the patron of the city of Recanati in the Marche, is disputed, and some scholars identified him as Ignatius of Antioch: according to the legend, after his death his heart opened and the name of Jesus (as referred by Lotto with the monogram YHS on it) in golden letters.\r On the right is Onuphrius the hermit, whose character was inspired by D\u00fcrer's Christ among the Doctors, which the German artist had painted in Venice in 1506.

It is housed in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence.\r The work has the signature LOTUS PICTOR 1517. The date places it during Lotto's sojourn in Bergamo, executed perhaps as a private commission. It is likely that it formed a cover for a portrait.\r The painting is known in catalogues only from the 20th century, when it was part of the Benson collection in London, and was acquired in 1975 by Alessandro Contini-Bonacossi for 750 million liras. It was later transferred from his collection to the Uffizi, which now exhibits the painting in the room for Lombard painters.\r The painting depicts the story of Susanna from the Old Testament. She was the wife of one Joachim, and received the advances of his husband's friends while taking a bath. After her refusal, the \"Elders\" accused her of adultery, but the accusation was later proved to be false thanks to the intervention of Daniel.\r Lotto portrayed her after getting naked for the bath (the clothes scattered around her), while the Elders burst into from the door of the bath's enclosure, followed by two serf called to support their accusation of adultery. The cartouches, showing the characters' dialogue, are an archaic element, perhaps required by the commissioner himself as a complement of the moral message.\r The upper part of the picture is occupied by a view of the garden and a castle within an idyllic landscape.

It is housed in the Accademia Carrara of Bergamo, northern Italy.\r The work is known since 1882, when the Accademia acquired it from a private collection. The subject was identified later, after the rebus included in it was recognized: the moon in the upper left background contains the inscription \"CI\", which, in Italian, translates as \"CI in Luna\", e.g. \"LuCIna\"; the Brembati coat of arms is instead contained in ring of the woman's left forefinger.\r The painting is a bust portrait, with the face slightly from three-quarters. Lucina wears rich clothes with gilt ribbons and shell-shaped embroideries, as well as several jewels including a necklace of pearls, and another with a horn-shaped pendant, which at the time was used as a toothpick.\r Working differently from the idealized portraits Titian and Palma the Elder had made widespread in Venice, Lotto used a more realistic approach: this is shown is details such as the asymmetric face, the weighty chin, and the sharp nose. In this he followed the local tradition of painters such as Paolo Cavazzola.\r According to some scholars, the man touching the womb could be an allusion to the character's pregnancy state. The dead weasel could also symbolize the defeat of a presage of disgrace for pregnant woman. According to other scholars, the weasel could symbolize marital fidelity.

It probably dates to the mid-1520s, but has been dated as late as the 1540s.\r It is a wedding gift for a couple of Bergamo or Venice. Such paintings were inspired by the classical tradition of wedding poetry.\r Venus, lying on the ground and leaning on an elbow on a blue cloth, is accompanied by her son Cupid standing with his bow and quiver. He urinates on the bride through a crown of laurels of myrtle which she holds by a ribbon and below which is suspended a burning incense burner. This urine stream is symbolic act, the meaning of which is to bring fertility, and which would have seemed humorous to contemporary viewers.\r There is on a background of red hanging tied to a tree on which climbs ivy. Around them are scattered allegorical objects of marriage (garland of myrtle), femininity (rose, seashell, rose petals), eternal love (ivy). The headdress of Venus, with the tiara, the veil and the earring, is typical of the Venetian brides of the sixteenth century. The pendant earring with a pearl is a symbol of purity. The gesture of Cupid that urinates through the crown on the belly of Venus is an erotic allusion to fertility.\r The painting is Lotto's typically individual contribution to the emerging Venetian tradition of the recling nude, begun by the Dresden Venus by Giorgione and Titian. The goddess shows no discomfort with her nakedness and looks at the spectator in the eye. In front of her are a stick and a snake. The goddess seems to bless the marrying couple, wishing them fertility, and preserving them from hidden dangers like the serpent.\r This painting is not recorded until an image of it was published in the Directory of paintings of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance by Salomon Reinach in 1918, as being with a French dealer in 1912. In 1986 it was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

It was also seen by the contemporary art biographer Giorgio Vasari, and it entered the English royal collection in 1660, having been bought at Amsterdam. In the past it has been attributed also to Titian and Correggio.\r The style is typical of Lotto's Venetian period, with denser tones, a softer chromatic range and atmospheric effects at the boundaries.\r The horizontal format, which Lotto had already experimented for portraits of couples, in this case was adopted also for a single subject, a Humanist portrayed among his collection of antiques marbles. It has been however supposed that the pieces shown were not real, but, more likely, models that have a symbolic role alluding to the nature and the virtues of the subject.\r The man sits next to a table, with a rich fur-lined jacket, and holds a statuette, which perhaps portrays a Diana of Ephesus. The hands touching the chest is a sentimental theme typical of Lotto's works. The tables has also a book and some ancient coins.\r According to the Royal Collection archives, the painting was in the possession of Andrea Odoni, then his brother, Alvise Odoni by 1555, then Lucas van Uffelen, probably by 1623, then Gerrit Reynst, 1639, then the States of Holland and West Friesland for presentation to Charles II as part of the Dutch Gift, 1660.

He is standing and showing a gilt lion paw. The right hand, in a sentimental gesture typical of Lotto, is touching his chest, showing two precious rings. The composition and the colors were highly influenced by Titian, then the most respected painter in Venice.\r The symbolic meaning of the lion paw has not been cleared.

They chose Nicholas because of their membership in a merchants brotherood, which was dedicated to that saint. A frame in Istrian stone had been already prepared before the work's execution.\r This was Lotto's first work after his return to Venice from Bergamo. Despite several innovative elements (such as the nocturnal landscape in the lower part), the canvas was poorly received by contemporaries. According to contemporary historians, the canvas was completed as soon as 1529.\r According to a pattern inspired by Albrecht D\u00fcrer's prints, Lotto placed St. Nicholas in the upper center, with a luminous halo crowning his face. The saint is looking upwards, suggesting that he is ascending, and is surrounded by three angels who keeps his mantle open and hold his traditional symbols: the mitre, the bishop's baton and three golden balls, remembering the three maidens saved by Nicholas according to the legend.\r Under him are St. John the Baptist (patron of one of the donors) and St. Lucy, an alleged tooth of whom was preserved in the church as a relic.\r The lower part is occupied by a dark landscape, featuring, among the others, a sea harbor and a port struck by a storm.

Otherwise, it could date to a later period when he moved there to executed other works. Today it is generally assigned to a few time after the Crucifixion of Monte San Giusto (1533-1534).\r The commissioners were perhaps the Brotherhood of the Recanati Traders, who moved to a new seat in 1533 and would therefore use the work for the latter's decoration.\r The canvas is mentioned for the first time in 1601.\r The painting depicts a bedroom where an Annunciation takes place following an unusual scheme: the angel is on the right, holding a white lily, and has got in from a loggia which opens to a garden (the hortus conclusus). His right arm is pointing at the Father God who has shown in a cloud and is blessing Mary from inside the loggia. Mary is portrayed in the left foreground, looking at the spectator and raising her hands in a surprised gesture.\r Stylistically, Lotto used expressive gestures and somewhat under-size heads. The number of carefully painted details show the influence of Northern European paintings: they include the baldachin bed, the small window with sealed glasses, the shelf with a small still life, the hatstand, the stool with an hourglass, the prie-dieu and a scared cat which is fleeing. The baldachin was inspired by a relief by Andrea Sansovino at Loreto.\r The Madonna who face the seer and the angel who tries to draw her attention are taken instead from Titian works.

It is housed in the Louvre in Paris. A later version of the same subject is the St. George in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\r This painting and the equally small Saint Michael, also in the Louvre, are a pair. In the Mazarin Collection they were joined together, forming a diptych, and bound in leather. Louis XIV acquired them from Mazarin's heirs in 1661.\r Saint George has sometimes been ascribed to the artist's Roman period, because the horse resembles one of the horses of Monte Cavallo (the Quirinal Palace). However, Raphael could easily have known this particular horse from a drawing of it, done by one of Leonardo's pupils. To judge by the still somewhat na\u00efve and Peruginesque style of the painting, it is really one of Raphael's early works, dating from about 1504. He did another painting of the same subject a little later (the mentioned panel in Washington D. C.), and towards the end of his life he painted a large Sant Michael which is also in the Louvre.\r Giovanni Lomazzo, in his Trattato della Pittura (1584), mentions a Saint George by Raphael, commissioned by the Duke of Urbino, which was painted on a little chess-board (tavoliere). According to the old catalogues the small Saint Michael, if not the saint George as well, had a draught-board on the back which is now covered over. Examination by means of X-rays and infrared has not confirmed this statement. In the abovementioned book, Lomazzo seems to have confused various pictures of the same subject.

Completed in 1504 for the Franciscan church of San Francesco, Citt\u00e0 di Castello, the painting depicts a marriage ceremony between Mary and Joseph. It changed hands several times before settling in 1806 at the Pinacoteca di Brera.\r In the later years of the 15th century, patrons in Citta di Castello sent three commissions to Raphael's teacher Pietro Perugino which, in Perugino's absence, were completed by Raphael. The Marriage of the Virgin was the last of these. Evidently inspired by one of Perugino's paintings, also known as Marriage of the Virgin, Raphael completed his own work, according to the date placed next to his signature, in 1504. There have been several historians who have disputed that Perugino's painting preceded Raphael's and some who have suggested the painting was not Perugino's at all but instead produced after Raphael's by one of Perugino's followers, but 16th century documentary evidence supports the conclusion that Perugino had begun working on the painting in 1499, though it was not completed until some point after December 26, 1503.\r This particular piece was commissioned by one Filippo degli Albezzini to hang in a church dedicated to Saint Francis. It remained in its original home until General Giuseppe Lechi led forces to Citt\u00e0 di Castello to liberate it from Austrian occupation, when the painting was gifted to (or perhaps demanded by) the general. \"Restoring Raphael\" in the Cambridge Companion to Raphael (2005) reports that the painting remained with Lechi to his death in 1804, but Lechi died in 1836. The Cyclopedia of Painters and Paintings states rather that Lechi sold the piece in 1801 to one Giacomo Sannazaro, who himself sold the piece in 1804 to the Ospedale Maggiore in Milan. By whatever means it arrived there, it was in the possession of the hospital for a short time, as in 1806 the hospital sold it to the Italian state for 53,000 francs. It has since then been displayed in the Pinacoteca di Brera, in spite of an 1859 proposal to donate the image to France after that country's army had entered Milan.\r Through these various relocations, the painting was damaged. The panel had several cracks in the upper half, while there was rippling and bowing throughout. Italian artist Giuseppe Molteni, retained to repair it in November 1857, chose to preserve the panel rather than transfer the painting to canvas and spent months flattening the panel and hydrating it to overcome the damage of desiccation. This decision on the part of Molteni has permitted 20th-century art historians to use infrared reflectography to study the underdrawing beneath the completed art work. Molteni also undertook to clean the surface of the painting, which had been subjected to restoration before. He did not clean aggressively, as he wanted to be sure that elements of the original painting were preserved. The Cyclopedia of Painters and Paintings indicates that the painting is \"somewhat discoloured.\"\n", "\nArtist: Raphael\nArtwork Name: Vision of a Knight\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: oil,poplar\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/vision-of-a-knight\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Vision of a Knight, also called The Dream of Scipio or Allegory, is a small egg tempera painting on poplar by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael, finished in 1504\u20131505. It is in the National Gallery in London. It probably formed a pair with the Three Graces panel, also 17\u00a0cm square, now in the Ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly museum.\r There are a number of theories as to what the panel is intended to represent. Some art historians think the sleeping knight represents the Roman general Scipio Africanus (236\u2013184 BC) who dreamed that he had to choose between Virtue (behind whom is a steep and rocky path) and Pleasure (in looser robes). However, the two feminine figures are not presented as contestants. They may represent the ideal attributes of the knight: the book, sword and flower which they hold suggest the ideals of scholar, soldier and lover which a knight should combine.\r The most likely source for the allegory depicted is from a passage in the Punica, an epic poem recounting the Second Punic War by the Latin poet Silius Italicus.\r The panel was moved to England by William Young Ottley in 1800.\r Raphael used an extensive palette of paints to depict this colourful scene, pigments such as lead-tin yellow, ultramarine, verdigris and ochres were identified. .\n", "\nArtist: Raphael\nArtwork Name: St. Michael\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/st-michael-1505\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSt. Michael is an oil painting by Italian artist Raphael. Also called the Little St. Michael to distinguish it from a larger, later treatment of the same theme, St. Michael Vanquishing Satan, it is housed in the Louvre in Paris. The work depicts the Archangel Michael in combat with the demons of Hell, while the damned suffer behind him. Along with St. George, it represents the first of Raphael's works on martial subjects.\r An early work of the artist, the painting was executed for Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, in 1504 or 1505 on the back of a draughtboard, possibly commissioned to express appreciation to Louis XII of France for conferring the Order of Saint Michael on Francesco Maria I della Rovere, Urbino's nephew and heir. Whatever the impetus for its creation, by 1548 it hung in the collection at the Palace of Fontainebleau.\r In 2006's Early Work of Raphael, Julia Cartwright suggests it may betray the influence of Timoteo Viti in the gold tinting to the green wings of Michael, while the sinners in the background suggest that Raphael may have consulted an illustrated volume of Dante's Inferno. The punishments depicted reflect Dante's treatment of hypocrites and thieves.\r A little more than a decade after completing the little St. Michael, Raphael was commissioned to revisit the theme, producing St. Michael Vanquishing Satan for Pope Leo X in 1518.\n", "\nArtist: Raphael\nArtwork Name: Terranuova Madonna\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: board,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/terranuova-madonna\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna with Child, St. John and a Child Saint is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael, who finished it around 1504\u20131505.

The date of origin has not been positively determined, though it seems to have been painted at some point after his arrival to study with Pietro Perugino in about 1500, possibly 1503-1505. According to James Patrick in 2007's Renaissance and Reformation, the painting represents the first time that Raphael had depicted the nude female form in front and back views.\r The image depicts three of the Graces of classical mythology. It is frequently asserted that Raphael was inspired in his painting by a ruined Roman marble statue displayed in the Piccolomini Library of the Siena Cathedral\u201419th-century art historian [Dan K] held that it was a not very skillful copy of that original\u2014but other inspiration is possible, as the subject was a popular one in Italy. Julia Cartwright in Early Work of Raphael (2006) proposes that the painting bears far more influence of the school of Ferrara than classical sculpture, making clear that the statue was not Raphael's model.\r The three women in the painting may represent stages of development of woman, with the girded figure on the left representing the maiden (Chastitas) and the woman to the right maturity (Voluptas),though other interpretations have certainly been advanced.\r In 1930, Professor Erwin Panofsky proposed that this painting was part of a diptych along with Vision of a Knight and that based on the theme of Vision the painting represented the Hesperides with the golden apples which Hercules stole. Some art historians disagree with Panofsky's conclusion. Roger Jones and Nicholas Penny, in 1987's biography Raphael, suggest that the scale differences of the figures in the paintings make it unlikely that they were intended as a diptych, though \"one might have formed the lid of the other.\" In 16th Century Italian Art (2006), Michael Wayne Cole opines that while \"there can be no doubt that they form a pair...they must not be imagined as a diptych, which is excluded by their square shape and also by the change in scale of the figures.\" Cole presents the figures as handmaidens of Venus, holding the golden apples with which she is associated and affirming the proper connection of \"Virtus\" (presented by Vision) and Amor.\r The Three Graces remain a motif in pop culture.\n", "\nArtist: Raphael\nArtwork Name: Madonna in the Meadow\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/madonna-in-the-meadow-1506\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna del Prato (Madonna of the Meadow), formally Madonna with the Christ Child and Saint John the Baptist, is a 1506 painting by Raphael, now held in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.

A 10-year restoration process was completed in 2008, after which the painting was returned to its home at the Uffizi in Florence. During the restoration, an antique copy replaced the painting in the gallery.\r Raphael is considered to be a \u201cmaster\u201d of the High Renaissance, a title he shares with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. He was born in 1483 and died in 1520, living a mere thirty-seven years. Despite his relatively short lifespan, he was highly influential throughout his time on earth. He produced a vast quantity of work in a variety of media. He was active in architecture, printmaking, painting, and drawing. During the first half of his career, he spent years traveling across Northern Italy and was influenced by the Florentine styles he saw there, causing this stage to be called his Florentine Period. After which, in 1508, he moved to Rome where he continued to work. Many of his commissions came from the Vatican, including the Apostolic Palace, which brought about one of his most famous works, School of Athens. Due to his relationship with the church, he and Michelangelo were fierce rivals throughout both of their careers, and often competed for the same commissions. During his Florentine period, this work, The Madonna Del Cardellino, was painted along with several other well-known Madonnas: The Madonna of the Meadow and La Belle Jardini\u00e8re. All three share several characteristics: Madonna is clothed in red and blue, the same three subjects are painted, the pyramidal composition, the natural background, and the connection to the church through the representation of books, crosses, or, indeed, the goldfinch.\r In this painting, as in most of the Madonnas of his Florentine period, Raphael arranged the three figures - Mary, Christ and the young John the Baptist - to fit into a geometrical design. Though the positions of the three bodies are natural, together they form an almost regular triangle. The Madonna is shown young and beautiful, as with Raphael\u2019s various other Madonnas. She is also clothed in red and blue, also typical, for red signifies the passion of Christ and blue was used to signify the church. Christ and John are still very young, only babies. John holds a goldfinch in his hand, and Christ is reaching out to touch it. The background is one typical of Raphael. The natural setting is diverse and yet all calmly frames the central subject taking place.\r The Madonna was a wedding gift from Raphael to his friend Lorenzo Nasi. On November 17, 1548 Nasi's house was destroyed by an earthquake and the painting broke into seventeen pieces. It was immediately taken to be salvaged, and was hastily put back together, though the seams were quite visible. In 2002, George Bonsanti of the Precious Stones organization gave the task of restoration to Patrizia Riitano. During the six-year process that followed, her team worked to remove the years of grime that had degraded the painting's color, and to fix the damage done by the earthquake long ago. Before beginning the project, they studied the work as closely as possible, utilizing resources such as X-rays, CAT scans, reflective infra-red photography, and even lasers. Riitano closely studied the past quick fix layers that had been applied and removed them until the original by Raphael finally shone through. The restoration was completed in 2008, and the painting was put on display in Uffizi.\n", "\nArtist: Raphael\nArtwork Name: Portrait of a Lady with a Unicorn\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/portrait-of-a-lady-with-a-unicorn-1506\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Young Woman with Unicorn is a painting by Raphael, which art historians date to 1505 or 1506. It is in the Galleria Borghese in Rome. The painting was originally oil on panel, and was transferred to canvas during conservation work in 1934. It was in the course of this work that overpainting was removed, revealing the unicorn, and removing the wheel, cloak, and palm frond that had been added by an unknown painter during the mid-17th century.\r The composition of the picture--placing the figure in a loggia opening out onto a landscape, the three-quarter length format-- was apparently inspired by the Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo between 1503 and 1506. Christof Thoenes observes: \"However unabashedly Raphael adopts the pose, compositional framework and spatial organization of the Leonardo portrait...the cool watchfulness in the young woman's gaze is very different\" from the \"enigmatic ambiguity\" of Mona Lisa.\r The work was of uncertain attribution until recent times. In the 1760 inventory of the Gallery, the subject of the painting was identified as Saint Catherine of Alexandria and attributed to Perugino. A restoration of the painting in 1934\u201336 confirmed art historian Roberto Longhi's attribution of the work to Raphael, and the removal of heavy repainting revealed the unicorn, traditionally a symbol of chastity in medieval romance, in place of a Saint Catherine wheel. Later restoration work on the painting in 1959 revealed through radiography the image of a small dog, a symbol of conjugal fidelity, under the unicorn. This alteration is believed to have been made by Raphael; it is not known why the alteration was made.\n", "\nArtist: Raphael\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Agnolo Doni\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/portrait-of-agnolo-doni-1506\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Agnolo Doni is an oil painting by Italian Renaissance master Raphael, executed between 1506 and 1507.

The saint wears the blue garter of the English Order of the Garter, reflecting the award of this decoration in 1504 to Raphael's patron Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, by King Henry VII of England. The first word of the order's motto, \"HONI\" can be made out. The painting was presumably commissioned by the Duke, either to present to the English emissary who brought the regalia to Urbino, Sir Gilbert Talbot, or to Henry himself\u2014recent scholarship suggests the latter. The honour paid to a minor Italian ruler reflected Henry's appreciation of the cultural prestige of Renaissance Italy as much as any diplomatic purpose.\r The traditional subject, Saint George and the Dragon, combining chivalry and Christianity, is appropriate for the occasion; like his father, Guidobaldo was a condottiero, or proprietor of a band of mercenary soldiers. In the early stages of his career Raphael painted a number of tiny cabinet paintings, including another St George in the Louvre, and the Vision of a Knight in the National Gallery in London.\r By 1627 the painting belonged to William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (1580-1630), and was at Wilton House in Wiltshire. Either the 3rd or 4th earl presented it to King Charles I of England. After the English Civil War it was sold in one of the sales of the Royal Collection at Somerset House in London on 19 December 1651. Soon after it was in France. The painting was later a highlight of the Pierre Crozat collection which was acquired through Diderot's mediation by Catherine II of Russia in 1772. For a century and a half, the panel hung in the Imperial Hermitage Museum. It was one of the most popular paintings in the entire collection of the Tsars. In March 1931 it was part of the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings, and bought by Andrew Mellon, as part of his founding donation to the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C.

Signed and dated \"Raphael Urbinas MDVII (1507)\", the painting is in the Galleria Borghese in Rome. It is the central panel of a larger altarpiece commissioned by Atalanta Baglioni of Perugia in honor of her slain son, Grifonetto Baglioni. Like many works, it shares elements of the common subjects of the Deposition of Christ, the Lamentation of Christ, and the Entombment of Christ. The painting is on wood panel and measures 184 x 176\u00a0cm.\r In the early part of the 16th Century, violence among factions, mostly in the form of hand-to-hand combat, was relatively common in Perugia and other parts of Italy, such as Florence. The Baglioni family were the lords of Perugia and surrounding areas, and also leading condottiere or leaders of mercenary troops. There was an especially bloody episode in Perugia on the night of July 3, 1500, when Grifonetto Baglioni and some angry members of the family conspired to murder much of the rest of the Baglioni family as they slept. According to Matarazzo, the chronicler of the family, following the bloodshed, Grifonetto\u2019s mother Atalanta Baglioni refused to give her son refuge in her home and when he returned to the city he was confronted by Gian Paolo Baglioni, the head of the family who had survived the night by escaping over the roof tops. Atalanta changed her mind and rushed after her son, but arrived only in time to see her son being killed by Gian Paolo and his men. A few years later, Atalanta commissioned the young Raphael to paint an altarpiece to commemorate Grifonetto in the family chapel in San Francesco al Prato. Raphael took the commission very seriously, over the course of two years working on and developing his design through two phases and numerous preparatory drawings. This was the last of several major commissions by the young Raphael for Perugia, the home city of his master Perugino. He had already painted for the same church the Oddi Altarpiece (now in the Vatican) for the Baglioni's great rival family (with whom they were also intermarried), and other large works. The new commission marked an important stage in his development as an artist, and the formation of his mature style. The painting remained in its location until in 1608, it was forcibly removed by a gang working for Cardinal Scipione Borghese, nephew of Pope Paul V. In order to pacify the city of Perugia, the Pope commissioned two copies of the painting from Giovanni Lanfranco and the Cavaliere d\u2019Arpino, and that by Arpino is still in Perugia. Though confiscated by the French in 1797 and exhibited in Paris in the Louvre, then renamed the Napoleon Museum, it was returned to the Galleria Borghese in 1815, except for the predella which was taken to the Vatican Museums.\r Raphael made numerous preparatory sketches or drafts as his idea for the composition evolved (several are on Wikimedia Commons - see link below). He started with the subject of a Lamentation over the dead Christ, similar to the famous painting of the same name by his teacher Pietro Perugino. He moved from that idea to an Entombment of Christ, perhaps inspired by an ancient Roman sarcophagus relief of Meleager from Greek mythology, Michelangelo\u2019s Entombment or the print of the Entombment by Mantegna. Looking through his studies, we can see that this long period of evolution gave Raphael the opportunity to put into practice much of the new style and techniques he had been developing from his studies of Renaissance masters Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo as well as others artists of the period. The two design phases may broadly be labeled \u2018Perugian\u2019 and \u2018Florentine\u2019. The significant change of subject from a Lamentation to an Entombment affected the character of the painting on the whole because it changed from a more iconic Piet\u00e0 to a subject with more narrative interest.\n", "\nArtist: Raphael\nArtwork Name: The Pregnant Woman, La Donna Gravida\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/the-pregnant-woman-la-donna-gravida-1507\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLa donna gravida (or simply La gravida; Italian for \"The Pregnant Woman\") is an oil on wood portrait by the Italian High Renaissance artist Raphael.

It is housed in the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9 of Chantilly, France.\r For centuries the painting kept company with Raphael's Portrait of Pope Julius II, first at the Santa Maria del Popolo, then in private collections, and for a time their location was unknown. Their ownership, or provenance, has been difficult to unravel because of the number of copies of both paintings, the unclear ownership chain, misinformation and delay of publication of vital information.\r For instance, this painting received its name from a copy at the Basilica della Santa Casa in Loreto which was at one time thought to be the original. Now is it certain that the painting at Loreto was a copy \u2013 and therefore the painting name is a misnomer.\r Even so, the well-copied painting has been a beloved and critically acclaimed painting for centuries.\r The painting is tender and intimate. The Child, just awakened, plays a game with the Madonna's veil, with a melancholy Saint Joseph looking on from the shadows.\r The use of veil in Renaissance paintings, from the Meditations on the Life of Christ, symbolizes the manner in which the Madonna wrapped the Child in the veil from her head at the Nativity and, prophetically, again at the Crucifixion.\r Saint Joseph's melancholy nature in this picture may signal his proclivity for prophecy and the coming events for the Child. Saint Joseph seemed to be an after-thought, x-rays of the painting show that Saint Joseph was painted over a window previously over the Madonna's shoulder. Further, the change in the position of the Child's right foot was revealed via x-ray. These changes align with Raphael's preliminary drawings for the painting.\r The Madonna's dress, frame and angle of her head are reminiscent of Justice in the Stanza della Segnatura which was painted about the same time as this painting. It is also reminiscent of the Madonna of the Blue Diadem.\r The history of the painting is difficult to track for many reasons, one of them being the various names for the painting, which tell the history, or the perceived history, of the original Raphael painting. This work is one of the most copied works of Raphael with over one hundred known copies.\r The provenance of this painting is constructed based on documents, analysis of the painting and preliminary sketches. For centuries the painting was co-located with the Portrait of Pope Julius II, first at the Santa Maria del Popolo, then in private collections, and for a time their location was unknown. The original painting by Raphael is now believed to be the version at Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9 in Chantilly, France.\r Julius II commissioned of Raphael the Madonna of the Veil and his likeness, the Portrait of Pope Julius II which resided at Santa Maria del Popolo, at the entrance gate to Rome. During this time the painting was also known as Madonna del Popolo or described as The Holy Family.\r An array of Renaissance artists were brought in to decorate the Santa Maria del Popolo church and its chapels in Rome, beginning with Raphael. Both paintings by Raphael, Julius II and the Madonna were hung on pillars during feast days or high holy days.\n", "\nArtist: Raphael\nArtwork Name: Portrait of a Cardinal\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/portrait-of-a-cardinal\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of a Cardinal is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael.

It was painted between 1509 and 1511 as a part of Raphael's commission to decorate the rooms now known as the Stanze di Raffaello, in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. The Stanza della Segnatura was the first of the rooms to be decorated, and The School of Athens, representing Philosophy, was probably the third painting to be finished there, after La Disputa (Theology) on the opposite wall, and the Parnassus (Literature). The picture has long been seen as \"Raphael's masterpiece and the perfect embodiment of the classical spirit of the Renaissance\".  The School of Athens is one of a group of four main frescoes on the walls of the Stanza (those on either side centrally interrupted by windows) that depict distinct branches of knowledge. Each theme is identified above by a separate tondo containing a majestic female figure seated in the clouds, with putti bearing the phrases: \"Seek Knowledge of Causes,\"  \"Divine Inspiration,\"  \"Knowledge of Things Divine\" (Disputa), \"To Each What Is Due.\"  Accordingly, the figures on the walls below exemplify Philosophy, Poetry (including Music), Theology, and Law. The traditional title is not Raphael's. The subject of the \"School\" is actually \"Philosophy,\" or at least ancient Greek philosophy, and its overhead tondo-label, \"Causarum Cognitio\", tells us what kind, as it appears to echo Aristotle's emphasis on wisdom as knowing why, hence knowing the causes, in Metaphysics Book I and Physics Book II. Indeed, Plato and Aristotle appear to be the central figures in the scene. However, all the philosophers depicted sought knowledge of first causes. Many lived before Plato and Aristotle, and hardly a third were Athenians. The architecture contains Roman elements, but the general semi-circular setting having Plato and Aristotle at its centre might be alluding to Pythagoras' circumpunct.  Commentators have suggested that nearly every great ancient Greek philosopher can be found in the painting, but determining which are depicted is difficult, since Raphael made no designations outside possible likenesses, and no contemporary documents explain the painting. Compounding the problem, Raphael had to invent a system of iconography to allude to various figures for whom there were no traditional visual types. For example, while the Socrates figure is immediately recognizable from Classical busts, the alleged Epicurus is far removed from his standard type. Aside from the identities of the figures depicted, many aspects of the fresco have been variously interpreted, but few such interpretations are unanimously accepted among scholars.  The popular idea that the rhetorical gestures of Plato and Aristotle are kinds of pointing (to the heavens, and down to earth) is very likely. But Plato's Timaeus \u2013 which is the book Raphael places in his hand \u2013 was a sophisticated treatment of space, time, and change, including the Earth, which guided mathematical sciences for over a millennium. Aristotle, with his four-elements theory, held that all change on Earth was owing to motions of the heavens. In the painting Aristotle carries his Ethics, which he denied could be reduced to a mathematical science. It is not certain how much the young Raphael knew of ancient philosophy, what guidance he might have had from people such as Bramante, or whether a detailed program was dictated by his sponsor, Pope Julius II.\n", "\nArtist: Raphael\nArtwork Name: The Alba Madonna\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/the-alba-madonna\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Alba Madonna is a painting by the Italian High Renaissance artist Raphael, depicting Mary, Jesus and John the Baptist, in a typical Italian countryside. John the Baptist is holding up a cross to Jesus, which the baby Jesus is grasping. All three figures are staring at the cross. The three figures are grouped to the left in the round design, but the outstretched arm of the Madonna and the billowing material of her cloak balance the image.\r This Madonna was commissioned by Paolo Giovio who planned to send it to the church of the Olivetani in Nocera dei Pagani. In the 18th century, the painting belonged to the Spanish House of Alba, whose name it bears. In 1836 it was acquired by Nicholas I of Russia, who made it one of the highlights of the Imperial Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. A century later the Soviet Government clandestinely sold it to Andrew W. Mellon, who donated his collection to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., where it may be seen today.\r During its time in the Hermitage, the painting would be transferred from a circular panel to a square canvas during the early nineteenth century. Through analysis of the painting, it was determined that the original panel was severely splitting down the center and on the right side. The canvas pattern is visible in the painting and the landscape on the far right was damaged in the transfer process.\r During World War II a group of over 100 pieces of art belonging to the National Gallery of Art, including this one, were transported by train to Asheville, NC where they would be stored in the unfinished music room of the Biltmore House. Done with the utmost secrecy, heavy steel doors were installed and bars were put in the windows of the barren music room.

First painted on wood panel, it was later transferred to canvas.\r The painting was executed for Sigismondo de' Conti, chamberlain to Pope Julius II, in 1511. It was placed on a high altar of the church of Santa Maria in Aracoeli on Capitoline Hill (Italian: Campidoglio) in Rome, where Sigismondo was buried in 1512.\r It was moved by Anna Conti, a descendant of Sigismondi Conti, to the monastery of St. Anne in Foligno in 1565 and remained there for more than two centuries, hence the name.\r In 1799 it was carried to Paris, France by Napoleon. There, in 1802, the painting was transferred from panel to canvas by Hacquin and restored by Roser of Heidelberg. A note was made by the restorer: \"Rapporto dei cittadini Guijon Vincent Tannay e Berthollet sul ristauro dei quadri di Raffaello conosciuto sotto il nome di Madonna di Foligno.\" \r In 1815, after the Battle of Waterloo, it was returned to Italy, where it was placed in the room with the Transfiguration in the Pinacoteca Vaticana of the Vatican Museum in the Vatican City.\r The painting is a sacra conversazione, where holy figures seem to be in conversation and draw the audience into their discussion. Rather than sitting under a canopy, of the Umbrian or Florentine style, the Virgin is seated on clouds, embracing Jesus, while surrounded by angels. They look down upon Sigismonde de' Conti, kneeling in a red, fur lined cape. Conti is presented by St. Jerome on the right with his lion, appealing for the Virgin's protection. On the left are the kneeling St. Francis of Assisi and St. John the Baptist, who is standing and wearing a tunic of skins. As St. John points to Jesus, he clearly looks out to us, pulling us in, while St. Francis points to us and looks at the Christ Child. Between the men is an angel, linking the saints of earth to the seraph host of heaven. Behind them are the towers of Foligno.\r Painted during Raphael's Roman period, it is a testament to his artistic maturity, evidenced in the paintings composition, coloring and form.\r Conti commissioned the painting to commemorate his survival of a shell that exploded near him during the Siege of Foligno, his home town. He credited his safety to heavenly intervention.\n", "\nArtist: Raphael\nArtwork Name: The Sistine Madonna\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/the-sistine-madonna-1513\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Sistine Madonna, also called the Madonna di San Sisto, is an oil painting by the Italian artist Raphael Sanzio. The altarpiece was commissioned in 1512 by Pope Julius II for the church of San Sisto, Piacenza. The canvas was one of the last Madonnas painted by the artist. Giorgio Vasari called it \"a truly rare and extraordinary work\".\r Relocated to Dresden from 1754, the well-known painting was particularly influential in Germany. After World War II, it was relocated to Moscow for a decade before being returned to Germany. It is now a masterpiece of the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister.\r The oil painting, measures 265\u00a0cm by 196\u00a0cm. In the painting the Madonna, holding the Christ Child and flanked by Saint Sixtus and Saint Barbara, stands on clouds before dozens of obscured cherubim, while two distinctive winged cherubim rest on their elbows beneath her.\r Pigment analysis of Raphael's masterpiece reveals the usual pigments of the renaissance period such as malachite mixed with orpiment in the green drapery on top of the painting, natural ultramarine mixed with lead white in the blue robe of Madonna and a mixture of lead-tin-yellow, vermilion and lead white in the yellow sleeve of St Barbara.\r The painting was commissioned by Pope Julius II in honor of his late uncle, Pope Sixtus IV, as an altarpiece for the basilica church of the Benedictine Monastery of San Sisto in Piacenza, with which the Rovere family had a long-standing relationship. The commission required that the painting depict both Saints Sixtus and Barbara. Legend has it that when Antonio da Correggio first laid eyes on the piece, he was inspired to cry, \"And I also, I am a painter!\"\r In 1754, Augustus III of Poland purchased the painting for 110,000\u00a0\u2013 120,000 francs, whereupon it was relocated to Dresden and achieved new prominence; this was to remain the highest price paid for any painting for many decades. In 2001's The Invisible Masterpiece, Hans Belting and Helen Atkins describe the influence the painting has had in Germany:\r If the stories are correct, the painting achieved its prominence immediately, as it's said that Augustus moved his throne in order to better display it. The Sistine Madonna was notably celebrated by Johann Joachim Winckelmann in his popular and influential Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums (1764), positioning the painting firmly in the public view and in the center of a debate about the relative prominence of its Classical and Christian elements. Alternately portraying Raphael as a \"devout Christian\" and a \"'divine' Pagan\" (with his distinctly un-Protestant Mary who could have as easily been Juno), the Germans implicitly tied the image into a legend of their own, \"Raphael's Dream.\" Arising in the last decades of the 18th century, the legend\u2014which made its way into a number of stories and even a play\u2014presents Raphael as receiving a heavenly vision that enabled him to present his divine Madonna. It is claimed the painting has stirred many viewers, and that at the sight of the canvas some were transfixed to a state of religious ecstasy akin to Stendhal Syndrome (including one of Freud's patients). This nearly miraculous power of the painting made it an icon of 19th-century German Romanticism. The picture influenced Goethe, Wagner and Nietzsche According to Dostoyevsky, the painting was \"the greatest revelation of the human spirit\". In 1855, the \"Neues K\u00f6nigliches Museum\" (New Royal Museum) opened in a building designed by Gottfried Semper, and the Sistine Madonna was given a room of its own.\n", "\nArtist: Raphael\nArtwork Name: Madonna of the Cloth\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/madonna-of-the-cloth\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna dell'Impannata is an oil on panel (158x125 cm) painting by the Italian High Renaissance painter Raphael.

He was a cultured man who liked the arts.\r The graceful, almost effeminate position of the subject along with the heavy contrast between light and shadow are atypical of Raphael's work, particularly of his portraits of men, demonstrating the artist's experimentation with different styles and forms in his later Roman period. The influence of the works of Leonardo, which Raphael studied astutely during this period of his career, is strikingly evident in this particular piece.\r The painting was a property of Altoviti\u2019s descendants until 1808, when it was sold to Ludwig I of Bavaria. It remained at the Alte Pinakothek until 1936, when, after many debates about its attribution, the painting was lured out of Nazi Germany by \"canny English dealers\".

Considered one of the great portraits of the Renaissance, it has an enduring influence. It depicts Raphael's friend, the diplomat and humanist Baldassare Castiglione, who is considered a quintessential example of the High Renaissance gentleman.\r The portrait was produced as a result of Raphael's friendship with Castiglione, whose ascent in courtly circles paralleled that of the artist. They were close friends by 1504, when Castiglione made his second visit to Urbino, as Raphael was gaining recognition as an artist in the humanist circle of the city's ducal court. Raphael was commissioned by Guidobaldo da Montefeltro in 1505 to paint a picture for Henry VII; Castiglione traveled to England to present the finished painting to the king. It is possible that Castiglione later served as a \"scholarly advisor\" for Raphael's The School of Athens, and that the depiction of Zoroaster in that fresco may be a portrait of the courtier.\r Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione may have had a practical and intimate purpose. Castiglione left his family behind when he went to Rome, and he wrote a poem in which he imagined his wife and son consoling themselves with the picture during his absence.\r The composition is pyramidal. It's one of only two Raphael's paintings on canvas (it was considered before as originally painted on a wood panel, and later transferred to canvas). Copies produced in the 17th century show Castiglione's hands in full, suggesting that the picture was subsequently cut by several inches at the bottom (at a later date researchers determined it has not been cut). Castiglione is seated against an earth-toned background and wears a dark doublet with a trim of squirrel fur and black ribbon; on his head is a turban topped by a notched beret. The attire indicates that this was painted during the winter, likely that of 1514\u20131515, when Castiglione was in Rome by appointment of Guidobaldo da Montefeltro to Pope Leo X. The lightest areas are the subject's face seen nearly head-on, a billow of white shirt front at his chest, and his folded hands, which are mostly cropped at the bottom edge of the canvas. Castiglione is seen as vulnerable, possessing a humane sensitivity characteristic of Raphael's later portraits. The soft contours of his clothing and rounded beard express the subtlety of the subject's personality. In his The Book of the Courtier Castiglione argued on behalf of the cultivation of fine manners and dress. He popularized the term sprezzatura, which translates roughly to \"nonchalant mastery\", an ideal of effortless grace befitting a man of culture. The concept eventually found its way into English literature, in the plays of Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare.\r The picture's elegance of execution is consistent with the attitude of the subject. Art historian Lawrence Gowing noted the counter-intuitive handling of gray velvet (actually a fur) as contrary to an academic modeling of form, with the broad surfaces banked in rich darkness and the fabric shining most brightly as it turns away from the light. For Gowing, \"The picture has the subtlety of baroque observation but the stillness and noble contour of classic painting at its peak.\" The portrait's composition and atmospheric quality suggest an homage to the Mona Lisa, which Raphael would have seen in Rome. Yet the Castiglione portrait transcends questions of influence; art historian James Beck wrote that \"The Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione stands as a final solution for single male portraiture within the Renaissance style....\"\n", "\nArtist: Raphael\nArtwork Name: The Veiled Woman, or La Donna Velata\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/the-veiled-woman-or-la-donna-velata\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLa velata, or La donna velata (\"The woman with the veil\"), is one of the most famous portraits by the Italian Renaissance painter Raphael.\r The subject of the painting appears in another portrait, La Fornarina, and is traditionally identified as the fornarina (bakeress) Margherita Luti, Raphael's Roman mistress.\r As usual with Raphael, the subject's clothing is chosen and painted with close attention; here it is strikingly opulent.\n", "\nArtist: Raphael\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Andrea Navagero and Agostino Beazzano\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/portrait-of-andrea-navagero-and-agostino-beazzano\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Andrea Navagero e Agostino Beazzano is a painting by the Italian High Renaissance painter Raphael, created in 1516.

It is an important work for the development of his style.\r It shows the common subject of Christ Carrying the Cross to his crucifixion, at the moment when he fell and his mother suffers a spasm of agony, the Swoon of the Virgin, or \"Lo Spasimo\". All the emotion of the painting is densely crammed into the foreground and the background is similar to that of a stage set with distant groups of people and crosses. The man on the left in the foreground is similar to a figure in Raphael\u2019s painting The Judgement of Solomon in the Raphael Rooms in the Vatican Palace, except reversed. Simon of Cyrene lifts Christ\u2019s cross momentarily and looks sternly at the guards. The four Marys are depicted on the right side of the painting and towering on either side of the composition are the guards. The concept of, and devotion to, the \"spasm\" of the Virgin was fashionable, if somewhat controversial, in early 16th century Catholicism, although in this work the Virgin has only fallen to her knees, not collapsed or fainted, as is often shown.\r The panel was commissioned by the Sicilian monastery of Santa Maria dello Spasimo in Palermo. Painted in Rome around 1517, it was shipped by sea, but the ship had a troubled journey and finally sank. This episode was narrated by Vasari:\r As the news of this was spread abroad, the Sicilian monks sought to regain the miraculous painting, but they had to ask for the Pope's intercession to retrieve it. It was carried safely to Sicily, and placed in Palermo, where it acquired great fame.\r In 1661 the painting was acquired by the Spanish Viceroy Ferrando de Fonseca on behalf of King Philip IV, who wanted it placed on the main altarpiece of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid chapel. Then it stayed in Paris from 1813 to 1822, because it was one of the paintings Napoleon took as booty during his war campaigns, and while there the painting was transferred to canvas, a practice much adopted in France during those times. After Paris, the picture (unlike many) was returned and finally re-integrated into the Spanish royal collections, later transferred to the Prado. Its present condition is not very good, mainly due to its change of support. However, its quality is clearer since cleaning and restoration in 2012.\r In the past its status as a work by the hand of Raphael has been disputed, but it is now generally accepted as not merely designed but in large part painted by Raphael himself, no doubt with the usual workshop assistance for the easier areas.\n", "\nArtist: Raphael\nArtwork Name: Madonna della Sedia\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/madonna-della-sedia-1518\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna della seggiola or Madonna della sedia is a Madonna painting by the Italian renaissance artist Raphael, dating to c. 1513-1514 and housed in the Palazzo Pitti collection in Florence. It depicts Mary embracing the child Christ, while the young John the Baptist devoutly watches.  Painted during his Roman period, this Madonna does not have the strict geometrical form and linear style of his earlier Florentine treatments of the same subject. Instead, the warmer colors seem to suggest the influence of Titian and Raphael's rival Sebastiano del Piombo.  Ingres greatly admired Raphael and paid tribute to him by including this painting in many of his works, such as in the background of Henri IV playing with his children and Raphael and La Fornarina, on the table in front of the subject in his Portrait of monsieur Rivi\u00e8re, and worked into the carpet in Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne. Johann Zoffany also included this painting along with many others in his 1770s painting of the Tribuna of the Uffizi.  Because of the painting's roundness, it became the subject of a legend in which a peasant girl saves a hermit from a pack of wolves in the branches of an oak, and the hermit prophesies that she will become immortalized for her good deed. Years later, the girl had two children, and the tree was made into wine barrels. Raphael happened upon the trio and used a barrel bottom to paint them. This scenario was the subject of an 1839 lithograph by August Hopfgarten and a painting by Johann Michael Wittmer.

Both works are located in the Louvre in Paris.\r Raphael first visited the subject of the archangel Michael at the behest of Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino. The miniature was completed in 1504 or 1505 on the back of a draughtboard, possibly commissioned to express appreciation to Louis XII of France for conferring the Order of Saint Michael on Francesco Maria I della Rovere, Urbino's nephew and heir. A little more than a decade after completing the little St. Michael, Raphael was commissioned to revisit the theme, producing St. Michael Vanquishing Satan for Pope Leo X.\r Raphael's contemporary, Sebastiano of Venice, wrote to Michelangelo in July of the year the painting was completed to complain of the coloring of the work, suggesting that the figure looked smoky or made of iron because of the exaggerated contrast between the two sides. This may have been the hand of Giulio Romano, who according to art historian Eug\u00e8ne M\u00fcntz overused black in a heavy-handed fashion to \"obtain a more powerful effect.\" To deal with coloring issues, the painting was restored in 1537\u20131540 by Francesco Primaticcio.

There is trace of payment by him to Raphael for 8 ducats in 1510, but this is generally considered just a down payment, since stylistically the work (inspired for example by Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling) cannot be dated before 1518.\r In Florence since as early as 1589, it was ceded to Francesco I de' Medici and was placed at the Uffizi.

Whether the figure on the left is actually a self-portrait by Raphael is uncertain , although it was already identified as such in a 16th-century print.\r The identity of the man portrayed before Raphael is unknown. Traditionally he was identified as his fencing master, since he holds the hilt of a sword. Modern art historians consider him as a close friend, or possibly one of the painter's pupils, perhaps Polidoro da Caravaggio or Giulio Romano. One possibility is Giovanni Battista Branconio, for whom Raphael had designed, in the Borgo quarter of Rome, the now destroyed Palazzo Branconio. Other people associated with the character include Pietro Aretino, Baldassarre Peruzzi and Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, as well as other painters such as Il Pordenone or Pontormo, but these hypotheses have been refuted by other portraits.\r The painting was owned by Francis I of France and, in the past, was assigned to other artists, including Sebastiano del Piombo.\n", "\nArtist: Raphael\nArtwork Name: The Visitation\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/the-visitation\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Visitation is a c. 1517 painting of the Visitation of the Virgin Mary to Saint Elizabeth by Raphael, in the Prado Museum since 1837.

It is in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica in Palazzo Barberini, Rome.\r It is probable that the picture was in the painter's studio at his death in 1520, and that it was modified and then sold by his assistant Giulio Romano. In the 16th century the picture was in the house of the Countess of Santafiora, a Roman noblewoman, and subsequently became property of the Duke Boncompagni and then of the Galleria Nazionale which still possesses it.\r The woman is traditionally identified with the fornarina (baker) Margherita Luti, Raphael's Roman lover, though this has been questioned. The woman is pictured with an oriental style hat and bare breasts. She is making the gesture to cover her left breast, or to turn it with her hand, and is illuminated by a strong light coming from outside. Her left arm has a narrow band carrying the signature of the artist, RAPHAEL URBINAS. It has been suggested that the right hand on the left breast reveals a cancerous breast tumour disguised in a classic pose of love. Another speculation is that she is touching her left breast to remind herself which side she last fed her child on, the child being Raphael's.\r X-Ray analyses have shown that in the background was originally a Leonardesque-style landscape in place of the myrtle bush, which was sacred to Venus, goddess of love and passion.\n", "\nArtist: Raphael\nArtwork Name: The Transfiguration\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil,tempera\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/the-transfiguration-1520\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Transfiguration is the last painting by the Italian High Renaissance master Raphael. Commissioned by Cardinal Giulio de Medici, the later Pope Clement VII (1523\u20131534) and conceived as an altarpiece for the Narbonne Cathedral in France, Raphael worked on it until his death in 1520. The painting exemplifies Raphael's development as an artist and the culmination of his career. Unusually for a depiction of the Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art, the subject is combined with an additional episode from the Gospels in the lower part of the painting.\r The Transfiguration stands as an allegory of the transformative nature of representation. It is now in the Pinacoteca Vaticana in Vatican City.\r By December 1516, the latest date of commission, Cardinal Giulio de Medici, cousin to Pope Leo X (1513\u20131521), was also the Pope's vice-chancellor and chief advisor. He had been endowed with the legation of Bologna, the bishoprics of Albi, Ascoli, Worcester, Eger and others. From February 1515, this included the archbishopric of Narbonne. He commissioned two paintings for the cathedral of Narbonne, The Transfiguration of Christ from Raphael and The Raising of Lazarus from Sebastiano del Piombo. With Michelangelo providing drawings for the latter work, Medici was rekindling the rivalry initiated a decade earlier between Michelangelo and Raphael, in the Stanze and Sistine Chapel.\r From 11 to 12 December 1516, Michelangelo was in Rome to discuss with Pope Leo X and Cardinal Medici the facade of the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence. During this meeting, he was confronted with the commission of The Raising of Lazarus and it was here that he agreed to provide drawings for the endeavour, but not to execute the painting himself. The commission went to Michelangelo's friend Sebastiano del Piombo. As of this meeting the paintings would become emblematic of a paragone between two approaches to painting, and between painting and sculpture in Italian art.\r An early modello for the painting, done in Raphael's studio by Giulio Romano, depicted a 1:10 scale drawing for the Transfiguration. Here Christ is shown on Mount Tabor. Moses and Eljah float towards him; John and James are kneeling to the right; Peter is to the left. The top of the model depicts God the Father and a throng of angels. A second modello, done by Gianfrancesco Penni, shows a design with two scenes, as the painting was to develop. This modello is held by the Louvre.\r The Raising of Lazarus was unofficially on view by October 1518. By this time Raphael had barely started on his altarpiece. By the time Sebastiano del Piombo's work was officially inspected in the Vatican by Leo X on Sunday, 11 December 1519, the third Sunday of Advent, The Transfiguration was still unfinished.\r Raphael would have been familiar with the final form of The Raising of Lazarus as early as the autumn of 1518, and there is considerable evidence that he worked feverishly to compete, adding a second theme and nineteen figures. A surviving modello for the project, now in the Louvre (a workshop copy of a lost drawing by Raphael\u2019s assistant Gianfrancesco Penni) shows the dramatic change in the intended work.\n", "\nArtist: Andrea del Sarto\nArtwork Name: Assumption of the Virgin\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-sarto/assumption-of-the-virgin-1529\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPasserini Assumption (Italian: Assunta Passerini) is a painting by Italian Renaissance artist Andrea del Sarto, painted in 1526.

In 1553 the friars of that church moved, together with their properties including this artwork, to the church of Sant'Antonio dei Servi.\r In 1639 the panel was acquired by Grand Duke Ferdinand II de' Medici; a copy paid by him to remain in the church is now in the Diocesan Museum of Cortona. the work later was moved to the current location, in pair with the similar Panciatichi Assumption also by Andrea del Sarto.\r Andrea del Sarto painted this work using his previous Panciatichi Assumption as model. the few variants include the dark background, instead of a landscape, the different position of Mary and the angels around her, and the replacement of the right kneeling apostle with Blessed Margaret of Cortona, who was the donor's protector. The left apostle was replaced by St. Nicholas, patron of the donor's father or dead son.\r At the time of the execution of this version, Andrea del Sarto was already married, and (as mentioned by late biographer Giorgio Vasari) Mary's face is likely a portrait of his wife.\n", "\nArtist: Andrea del Sarto\nArtwork Name: Assumption of the Virgin\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-sarto/assumption-of-the-virgin\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPanciatichi Assumption (Italian: Assunta Panciatichi) is a painting by Italian Renaissance artist Andrea del Sarto, painted c. 1522-1523. It is housed in the Galleria Palatina of Palazzo Pitti, Florence, Italy.\r The painting was commissioned by Bartolomeo Panciatichi (the Elder) for a private altar in the French church of Notre-Dame-de-Confort, in Lyon; however, when finished, it remained in Italy. It was subsequently acquired by Bartolomeo Panciatichi the Younger, the man later portrayed by Agnolo Bronzino. In 1526 Andrea del Sarto used the same composition in the Passerini Assumption, now housed in the same museum. Later, Bartolomeo gifted the work to Jacopo Salviati, who moved it to his villa del Poggio Imperiale. After all Salviati's possessions were confiscated by Duke Cosimo I de' Medici, the villa and all its content went to Paolo Giordano Orsini, husband of the duke's daughter Isabella d'Este.\r After several changes of property, including a period under the Odescalchi, the villa returned to the Medici family in 1602. In 1687 it was decided to the move the Assumption to Pitti Palace, as part of the collection of prince Ferdinando de' Medici. The panel was enlarged in that occasion, in order to mount the same frame of the Passerini Assumption, also taken to the palace.\r The work depicts the theme of the Assumption of Mary with two registers: the lower one shows the apostles of Jesus crowding around Mary's empty sepulcher, looking at her while she ascends to heaven in a cloud in the upper part, surrounded by happy puttoes. Andrea del Sarto painted two kneeling apostles in the middle, according to the traditional pyramidal composition of holy Conversations, joining them to a circle of other apostles which can be seen, for example, in Raphael's Oddi Altarpiece.\r The presence of a grotto at the right is unusual. Mary is looking upwards, surrounded by a celestial light . At her sides are two symmetrical groups of angels, whose tables perhaps were intended to contain the artist's signature, the donor's name and the execution year; another, in the middle, calls the apostles' attention towards Mary.\r Some of the characters were perhaps portraits of existing people. The apostle kneeling and looking towards the seer, for example, is sometimes identified as Andrea del Sarto's self-portrait.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Pope Alexander IV Presenting Jacopo Pesaro to St Peter\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/pope-alexander-iv-presenting-jacopo-pesaro-to-st-peter\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJacopo Pesaro being presented by Pope Alexander VI to Saint Peter is a oil painting on canvas by Titian, now in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp.\r It was commissioned by Bishop Jacopo Pesaro (b. 1460) as an ex-voto for the Venetian naval victory leading to the retaking of Santa Maura (Lefkada) from the Ottoman Turks in August 1502, a rare victory in the Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1499\u20131503), which concluded the next year with Venetian concessions, including the return of Santa Maura. Pesaro was a member of the leading patrician Pesaro family, who was appointed by the Borgia Pope Alexander VI a papal legate, commander of the Papal fleet in the region, and bishop of Paphos on Cyprus, a Greek island which was then a Venetian territory.\r It has sometimes been thought to be Titian's earliest painting, dating to as early as 1503, but this is now not believed, and a date nearer 1510-11 seems more likely.\r Saint Peter is enthroned at left, holding a book and with his gold and silver keys on the dais below him, which is appropriately made of petra, stone. Pope Alexander VI, the pope at the time of the battle, presents the kneeling Jacopo Pesaro to him. Pesaro carries a standard with Alexander's coat of arms. Below the saint classical-style sculpted reliefs are shown at two levels. As in the similar reliefs in the later Sacred and Profane Love, their exact subject matter has eluded identification, but Venus and Cupid seem to feature. This may just allude to Paphos, which in classical times was sacred to Venus, or, as the museum suggests, be an allegory which \"demonstrates how Pesaro, through his love of God, achieved victory on Santa Maura\".\r Pesaro has taken off his helmet, which sits beside the dais. Alexander had contributed 13 galleys to the mainly Venetian war effort, the Venetian fleet being commanded by Benedetto Pesaro, Jacopo's cousin. Between Pesaro's head and Peter war-galleys can be seen in action, and to the right of Alexander more sea, ending at the town of Lefkada, or perhaps one on Paphos.\r Apart from these specifics, the composition adapts the usual Venetian formula for an ex-voto of the donor being presented to the Virgin Mary by their patron saint, especially as developed by Giovanni Bellini, in whose studio Titian spent some time. The museum suggest that Bellini designed the painting, leaving the execution to Titian. Undoubtedly the figure of the saint is strongly reminiscent of Bellini's style, as is the pose of the pope. The latter's features were evidently copied from a medal or other image, so he is much less lively in appearance than the bishop, who was probably painted from live sittings.\r The tablet at centre bottom is a later addition, which identifies the artist and explains the subject (in notably vague terms), reading \"Ritratto di uno di casa Pesaro in Venetia che fu fatto generale di S.ta Chiesa. Tiziano F.[ecit]\" (\"Portrait of one of the Pesaro family of Venice who was made a general of the holy church. Titian made this\").\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Christ Carrying the Cross\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/christ-carrying-the-cross-1507\n\nWikipedia Article:\nChrist Carrying the Cross (also Ecce Homo) is a 1505 oil painting attributed to either the Italian Renaissance master Titian or Giorgione. It is located in the Scuola Grande di San Rocco in Venice, Italy.\r The painting is mentioned in several historical documents, since it has been the subject of veneration and devotion, due to its alleged miraculous properties. It was originally located in the church of San Rocco, annexed to the eponymuous Scuola where it is now, although it is unknown if it was on a pillar near the high altar or in a side chapel.\r The attribution of the work has been disputed since the very 16th century: Giorgio Vasari in both the first (1550) and second (1658) edition of his Lives assigns it to Giorgione and Titian at the same time. Further, both Titian and Giorgione had relationships with the guild which held the church and the Scuola; Giorgione was a friend of painter Vincenzo Catena, a member of the guild.\r The work's composition inspired numerous painters in Veneto and Lombardy, such as Lorenzo Lotto, Giovanni Bellini and Andrea Solario.\r Jesus is portrayed with a cross on his shoulder, on a dark background, while an executioner is holding a noose on his neck. At the side are two secondary figures. Jesus, with a doleful expression, is looking towards the seer. The profile of the executioner and of the side figures were perhaps inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's drawings, which would be part of Venetian collections at the time. Although the subject of Christ Carrying the Cross had long been a standard one in Italian art, Titian was following a type of \"close-up\" composition that had only recently been introduced to Northern Italy, from German or northern European examples.\r The painting features elements which were typical of both Titian and Giorgione: the sfumato contour of the figures and the inhomogeneous colors were common in the latter's works, while the robustness of the characters and their active participation to the event (differently than the quasi-dreaming contemplation of Giorgione) are a Titian feature.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Concert Champetre\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/concert-champetre-1511\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Pastoral Concert, F\u00eate champ\u00eatre or Le Concert champ\u00eatre is an oil painting of c. 1509 attributed to either of the Italian Renaissance masters, Titian (more usually today) or Giorgione. It is in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in Paris.\r The painting was originally attributed to Giorgione, but modern critics assign it more likely to the slightly younger Titian, as the figures' robustness is thought more typical of his style. It is also possible that Giorgione (whose works included elements such as music, pastoral subjects and the simultaneous representation of the visible and invisible) began the work, and then, after his death in 1510, it was finished by Titian.\r The work was owned by the Gonzaga family, perhaps inherited from Isabella d'Este: it was later sold to Charles I of England. When the English royal collections were dispersed following,the revolution of 1649, the painting was sold at auction to the German banker and art collector, Eberhard Jabach, who, in turn, sold it to Louis XIV in 1671.\r The painting was also attributed to Palma the Elder and Sebastiano del Piombo.\r \u00c9douard Manet conceived his Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe (1863) after viewing the Pastoral Concert in a visit to the Louvre museum.\r The painting portrays three young people on a lawn, playing with each other, while next to them a standing woman is pouring water from a marble basin. Both the women are naked apart from drapes that have fallen to their legs; the two men are dressed in contemporary costume. In the wide background is a shepherd and a landscape.\r The subject was perhaps the allegory of poetry and music: the two women would be an imaginary apparition representing the ideal beauty, stemming from the two men's fantasy and inspiration. The woman with the glass vase would be the muse of tragic poetry, while the other one would be that of the pastoral poetry. Of the two playing men, the one with the lute would represent the exalted lyric poetry, the other being an ordinary lyricist, according to the distinction made by Aristotle in his Poetics. Another interpretation suggests that the painting is an evocation of the four elements of the natural world (water, fire, earth and air) and their harmonic relationship.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: The Gipsy Madonna\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/the-gipsy-madonna-1511\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Gypsy Madonna is a panel painting of the Madonna and Child in oils of about 1510\u201311, by Titian, now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. It is a painting made for display in a home rather than a church.\r It is close to compositions by Titian's former master Giovanni Bellini, especially, when reversed, one of 1509 in the Detroit Institute of Arts, and has been seen as a challenge to the much older master, by taking on a characteristic compositional formula of his. The style is much indebted to Giorgione, and it was often attributed to him in the earlier 20th century. This is especially so in the \"harmonious fullness and slow gravity of form\" of the figure of the Virgin, which uses a type of figure Titian did not repeat in later Madonnas. The landscape is virtually identical to the left-most section of the background of the Dresden Venus, traditionally thought to have been begun by Giorgione, but with the landscape done after his death in 1510 by Titian.\r The right background is occupied with a cloth of honour, painted with careful attention to its folds (they were often stored folded up). These were hung behind thrones, as in very many paintings of enthroned Madonnas, and here it implies that an unoccupied throne is out of sight to the right. The Bellini in Detroit uses the same device. The composition is therefore a half-way stage between the older more formal enthroned Madonnas and newer compositions with the Virgin and Child shown informally in a landscape setting. Madonnas by Bellini and his followers had for some time been showing small glimpses of landscape to the sides of the painting, usually cut off by a parapet lower down, and the formula here, using a horizontal \"landscape\" format, develops this.\r The \"Gypsy Madonna\" is a 19th-century name for the painting, because of the Virgin's supposed \"dusky complexion and her dark hair and eyes\". She seems young even by the standards of Madonnas, and the hands of the Child are unusually engaged, respectively with his mother's fingers and her dress (this is a difference to the Bellini).\r According to Sidney J. Freedburg,\r Despite the debts to Bellini and Giorgione, the painting shows Titian, who was then around twenty-one, developing his own independent character and style.\r Technical examinations show that it was originally even closer to the Bellini in Detroit, and that many changes were made in the course of painting. Unlike Bellini's usual careful underdrawing, Titian \"used as his guidelines only summary strokes made with a fairly wide brush with thin wash shading\". Among several other changes, the head of the Child originally looked out at the viewer.\r Like several other important early Venetian paintings in Vienna, the work was (very likely) in the Venetian collection of Bartolomeo della Nave and in 1636 sold in Venice to the Duke of Hamilton, who brought it to London. In 1659, after Hamilton's execution, it was acquired by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria in Brussels, whose collection soon passed to the imperial collection in Vienna.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Do not touch me\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/do-not-touch-me-1512\n\nWikipedia Article:\nNoli me tangere is a c. 1514 painting by Titian of the Noli me tangere episode in St John's Gospel.

The 90\u00a0cm high by 151\u00a0cm wide Renaissance art work was most likely influenced by Giorgione\u2019s themes and motifs of landscapes and nude figures\u2014Titian was known to have completed some of Giorgione\u2019s unfinished works after Giorgione died at age 33 of the plague in 1510. The painting represents the artist\u2019s conception of the life cycle. Childhood and manhood are synonymous with earthly love and death approaching old age are drawn realistically. Titian\u2019s widely chosen topic in art history, ages of man, mixed with his own allegorical interpretation make The Three Ages of Man is one of Titian\u2019s most famous works.\r It was traditionally identified with a painting that Vasari states Titian painted after returning from Ferrara for his stepfather Giovanni di Castel Bolognese at Faenza, dated to 1515. Critics have also dated it slightly earlier, due to the three sleeping putti to the right, evidently modelled on the Tondo of the innocents by Romanino (Musei civici di Padova), which dates to 1513. Several copies of it are known, one of the best of which is that at Rome's Doria Pamphilj Gallery.\r After being painted the masterpiece fell into the hands of Matthaus Hopfer. He was known to have a house in the Grottenau filled with \u2018poetic fable\u2019 frescoes. After his death in 1611 it was passed down to the Ebert family, before being put into the Augsburg market. In 1662 Queen Christina of Sweden passed through the city on her way from the Netherlands to Rome. It was listed in her collection at Palazzo Riario in Rome in 1662. There are no verified records of the next exchange between Giovanni da Castel Bolognese and Otto Truchsess von Waldburg but it is a known fact that, at some point, the painting was in the care of both of their hands. Giovanni, a famous gem-engraver and medallist, was recorded as the next owner. Otto was a leading figure at the Habsburg court and a prominent art patron. Before the painting made its way to the museum it was recorded to have made its final presentation in Giovanni\u2019s home in Faenza. Prince Odescalchi gave it to the duke of Orl\u00e9ans in 1722 and it remained in the Orleans Collection until 1798. It was purchased with much of that collection by Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, whose descendents later deposited his whole collection with the National Gallery of Scotland for storage and display.\r The National Gallery of Scotland describes the painting as a poetic meditation on the transcience of human life and love set in a poetic landscape. At the right Cupid playfully clambers over two sleeping infants. At the left we see young lovers about to embrace. In the middle distance an old man, looking very much like the penitent St. Jerome, is contemplating a pair of skulls - by implication of former lovers. The church in the background may serve to remind viewers of the Christian promise of salvation and eternal life.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Sacred and Profane Love\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/sacred-and-profane-love-1514\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSacred and Profane Love (Italian: Amor Sacro e Amor Profano) is an oil painting by Titian, probably painted in 1515, early in his career. The painting is presumed to have been commissioned by Niccol\u00f2 Aurelio, a secretary to the Venetian Council of Ten, whose coat of arms appears on the sarcophagus or fountain, to celebrate his marriage to a young widow, Laura Bagarotto. It perhaps depicts a figure representing the bride dressed in white, sitting beside Cupid and accompanied by the goddess Venus.\r The title of the painting is first recorded in 1693, when it was listed in an inventory as Amor Divino e Amor Profano (Divine love and Profane love), and may not represent the original concept at all.\r Although \"much ink has been spilt by art historians attempting to decipher the iconography of the painting\", and some measure of consensus has been achieved, basic aspects of the intended meaning of the painting, including the identity of the central figures, remain disputed.\r Two women, who appear to be modelled on the same person, sit on a carved Ancient Roman sarcophagus that has been converted to a water-trough, or a trough made to look like a Roman sarcophagus; the broad ledges here are not found in actual sarcophagi. How the water enters is unclear, but it leaves through a phallic-looking brass spout between the two women, next to an anachronistic coat of arms in the carving. This belongs to Niccol\u00f2 Aurelio, whose presence in the picture is probably also represented by the spout.\r Between the two women is a small winged boy, who may be Cupid, son and companion of Venus, or merely a putto. He is looking intently into the water, and splashing a hand in it. The woman on the left is fully and richly dressed; her clothes are now usually recognized as those of a bride, though in the past they have been said to be typical of courtesan wear. In her hair she wears myrtle, both a flower sacred to Venus and one worn by brides.\r In contrast, the woman on the right is nude except for a white cloth over her loins and a large red mantle worn over one shoulder. It was generally recognised by the 20th century that, somewhat contrary to a natural first impression, if the painting indeed represented figures along the lines of Sacred and Profane Love, the clothed figure was \"profane love\", and the nude one \"sacred love\". The nude figure sits comfortably on the ledge of the trough, with one hand resting on it and the other held high, holding a vessel with smoke coming out of it, probably an incense-burner. In contrast the pose of the clothed figure, apparently poised and relaxed, becomes rather strange in the lower part of her body when considered carefully, \"the lower half of the bride's body is lost in her drapery and does not conform with her upper half\". The ledge seems too high for her to sitting on it properly, and her knees are wide apart. Perhaps she is actually sitting on something else beside the trough, or this may just be one of a number of lapses in depicting anatomy found in Titian's early career.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Flora\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/flora\n\nWikipedia Article:\nFlora is an oil painting by Italian late Renaissance painter Titian, dated to around 1515 and now held at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.\r The work was reproduced in numerous 16th century etchings. Later, it followed an unclear series of changes of hands at Bruxelles and Vienna. In the 17th century, it was sold by the Spanish ambassador at Amsterdam to Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria and was cited by Rembrandt in his Saskia Dressing as Flora of London and in two portraits in Dresden and New York. Later included in the Kunsthistorisches Museum of Vienna, it was one of the works exchanged with the Uffizi.\r In the 18th century, it was erroneously attributed to Palma the Elder.\r It portrays an idealized beautiful woman, a model established in the Venetian school by Titian's master Giorgione with his Laura. Her left hands holds a pink-shaded mantle, while another holds a handful of flowers and leaves.\r The woman was portrayed by Titian in numerous other works of the period, including the Woman at the Mirror, the Vanity, Salome and Violante, as well as some Holy Conversations. The meaning of the painting is disputed: some, basing for example to inscriptions added to the 16th century reproductions, identifies the woman as a courtesan; other consider it a symbol of nuptial love, although her dress is not a dressing one. The identification with Flora, the ancient goddess of Spring and vegetation, derives from the presence of Spring flowers in her hands.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Solome\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/solome-1515\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSalome is an oil painting, probably of Salome with the head of John the Baptist, by the Italian late Renaissance painter Titian. It is usually dated to around 1515 and is now in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery in Rome. Like other paintings of this subject, it has sometimes been considered to represent Judith with the Head of Holofernes, the other biblical incident found in art showing a female and a severed male head . Historically, the main figure has also been called Herodias, the mother of Salome.\r Sometimes attributed to Giorgione, the painting is now usually seen as one where Titian's personal style can be seen in development, with a \"sense of physical proximity and involvement of the viewer\", in which \"expert handling of the malleable oil medium enabled the artist to evoke the sensation of softly spun hair upon creamy flesh\".\r Erwin Panofsky suggested the head of John the Baptist might be a self-portrait, and it is possible that Titian was alluding to his private life with the model, anticipating Cristofano Allori's, Judith with the Head of Holofernes (1613, Royal Collection, and other versions), where the severed head was a self-portrait and Judith and the maid portraits of his ex-mistress and her mother. The model here, allowing for a degree of idealization, has been said to be the same used in the Dresden Venus (Giorgione and Titian, c. 1510).\r This composition was copied many times, in some cases at least by Titian's workshop.\r The possible provenance of the painting begins in 1533, with a Judith by Titian recorded in the collection of Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, a very important patron of Titian. No other surviving Titian painting seems to fit this record, so if it is not the painting now in Rome, it must be lost. In 1592 Duke Alfonso's grand-daughter, Lucrezia d'Este (1535\u20131598) owned a painting described as a \"Herodias\" (Salome's mother). What is certainly the Doria Pamphilj painting belonged by 1603 to Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini before passing to his niece Olimpia Aldobrandini, whose second husband was the ex-cardinal Camillo Pamphilj; since then it has passed by descent through the family. In the 18th century the painting was called a Herodias, but a number of foreign visitors who saw it record thinking the main figure to be Judith.\r If the painting's main figure was Herodias, traditionally seen as the prime mover of the conspiracy to get John the Baptist executed, the younger woman next to her would be intended to represent her daughter Salome, here shown as a figure in thrall to her more glamourous mother. The identification as Herodias seems to have no recent supporters, but that as Judith does.\r A medieval addition to the Salome legend held that, as well as her mother's hatred of John for his preaching against her, Salome was also motivated by a frustrated love for John, to which the cupid might refer. Her face is turned away from his head, but her eyes look back to it. Panofsky describes her as: \"Meditative, sad and a little benumbed, she seems to recoil from the face of St. John which yet attracts her sidelong glances with irresistible force\". Meanwhile, the maid \"looks at the heroine with the eyes of a faithful dog who feels and shares his master's distress without comprehending its cause\". Thus, in the pyramidal group of figures, the glances flow from the maid on the left, up to Salome at centre, and down to John at right, whose dead eyes are closed.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Portrait of a Man\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/portrait-of-a-man\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of a Man is an oil on canvas painting by Titian (950,2x45,1\u00a0cm), dating to around 1512.

It is known to have been in the Gonzaga family's collection in Mantua from which it was bought by Charles I of England. After Charles' execution, it was sold off and purchased by Louis XIV of France for the Palace of Versailles.  Several attempts have been made to identify the main female figure \u2013 these have included Titian's lover, Alfonso d'Este's lover Laura Dianti, or Federico Gonzaga's lover Isabella Boschetti. None of these theories fit the date ascribed to the painting through analysis of its style, which is 1512\u201315, when the courts of Mantua and Ferrara were first becoming interested in Titian. Dianti was painted by Titian in a portrait of 1523. She is probably just a model who appears in other paintings \u2013 the same woman with frizzy reddish blonde hair appears in a series of paintings from around the same time (including the Flora at the Uffizi, the Vanity in Munich, the Salome in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj, the Violante and the Young woman in a black dress in Vienna) as well as several Madonnas and the clothed figure in Sacred and Profane Love. As happened with the 'Bella' series, it was still customary for the artist's workshop to create similar works with variations from the same studies if not from the same cartoon.  Many versions of the work are known, equal in quality to the original but not as large. The best are in the MNAC in Barcelona, in the gallery of Prague Castle and in the National Gallery of Art in Washington.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: The Tribute Money\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/the-tribute-money-1516\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Tribute Money (Italian: Cristo della moneta \u2013 literally Christ of the coin) is a panel painting in oils of 1516 by Titian, now in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden, Germany. It depicts Christ and a Pharisee at the moment in the Gospels (Matthew 22:15\u201322, Mark 12:13\u201317, Luke 20:20\u201326) when Christ is shown a coin and says \"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's\". It is signed \"Ticianus F.[ecit]\", painted on the trim of the left side of the Pharisee's collar.\r It is possibly the earliest representation in art of this scene, which had a personal significance for Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, who commissioned it.\r The subject is very rare in art, and some authorities have said that this is the first representation in art. The novelty is explained by the special significance of the subject for the patron, who is presumed to have suggested it. With one level of appropriateness, it was created for the door of a cupboard or cabinet containing the collection of medals and ancient and modern coins of Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. In the following years the duke became a very important patron of Titian, partly because he was impressed by this first commission.\r At another level, the story had a political relevance. Duke Alfonzo's territories were partly in the Holy Roman Empire, and partly in the Papal States, giving the subject a particular meaning to him; the trap set for Christ by the question was one that Alfonso had been living in for some years. At the time the painting was produced he had been excommunicated and deprived, at least in theory, of some of his territories by the Papacy, after not following the papacy when it changed sides in the War of the League of Cambrai. For most of this period he was opposed to the papacy, which had been aggressively expanding the Papal States, and wanted to absorb the Duchy of Ferrara (as it eventually did when Alfonso's grandson died in 1597). For Alfonso the message of the injunction of Christ in the \"Tribute Money\" episode was probably that the Papacy should concentrate its attention on church matters, as opposed to expanding its territory. He included part of the gospel text of the episode on his gold coinage.\r Unusually for an early Titian, the painting can be dated with confidence, as Titian and two assistants or servants spent some five weeks staying at Alfonso's Castello Estense in Ferrara from 22 February 1516 until the end of March. Titian normally painted on canvas, but the original use of the painting as a door necessitated the panel support here.\r It is Titian's earliest signed painting, and was perhaps signed to show he was not a court painter, as well as advertising his name in a prominent court outside Venice and its territories. The location of the signature on the pharisee's collar may support it being a self-portrait (see below), with the signature \"identifying the subject like the inscription below the profile portrait on a coin\".\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Assumption of the Virgin\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/assumption-of-the-virgin-1518\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Assumption of the Virgin or Frari Assumption is a large altarpiece panel painting in oils by the Italian Renaissance artist Titian, painted in 1515\u201318. It remains in the position it was designed for, on the high altar of the Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari or Frari church in Venice. It is the largest altarpiece in the city, with the figures well over life-size, necessitated by the large church, with a considerable distance between the altar and the congregation.\r It marked a new direction in Titian's style, that reflected his awareness of the developments in High Renaissance painting further south, in Florence and Rome, by artists including Raphael and Michelangelo. The agitated figures of the Apostles marked a break with the usual meditative stillness of saints in Venetian painting, in the tradition of Giovanni Bellini and others.\r It was perhaps originally rather shocking for the Venetian public, but soon recognised as a masterpiece that confirmed Titian's position as the leading artist in Venice, and one of the most important in all Italy, a rival to Michelangelo and Raphael.\r The Assumption of Mary was a Catholic doctrine that remained optional in the early 16th century; it was not declared an article of faith until 1950. The Franciscan order whose church the Frari is, were always keen promoters of this and other aspects of Marian theology, in particular the related doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, then still a matter of live controversy. The doctrine held that the body of the Virgin Mary was \"assumed\" or moved physically into heaven \"at the end of her earthly life\". Most Catholics believed that this took place after a normal death (usually three days after in tradition), but some that Mary was still alive when it happened, a question that Munificentissimus Deus in 1950 was careful not to settle. At the base of the picture, glimpses of Mary's stone sarcophagus can be discreetly seen, allowing those believing in an assumption before death to ignore it or regard it as something else.\r The broad composition of Titian's painting, with a group of apostles below a rising Mary, shown as alive, who moves towards a group of angels in heaven, follows earlier depictions in art, though such an imagined scene did not form part of the doctrine. The related scene of the Coronation of the Virgin in heaven had tended to be replaced by scenes showing the moment of the actual assumption, as here, which was often combined with it. Here the angel accompanying God the Father on the right holds out a crown, which he is about to place on her head.\r The figures are in three zones, divided by spaces filled only with light. On the ground are the Apostles, tightly packed in a group and in a variety of dramatic poses, most looking up at the unprecedented sight of the Virgin Mary rising to heaven. They are shown in a variety of poses, ranging from gazing in awe, to kneeling and reaching for the skies, \"monumental figures ... massed in collective movement, united with shadow, heroic gestures are given a silhouette of unprecedented boldness\".\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: The Worship of Venus\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/the-worship-of-venus-1518\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Worship of Venus is an oil on canvas painting by the Italian artist Titian completed between 1518\u20131519, housed at the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain. It describes a Roman rite of worship conducted in honour of the goddess Venus each 1 April. On this occasion, women would make offerings to representations of the goddess so as to cleanse \"every blemish on their bodies\".\r In Titian's work, two nymphs, one young and one matronly, are situated to the right of the ceremony, attending to a shrine holding a representation of Venus. The shrine is surrounded by votive tablets. The older woman checks on the decorations with the use of a mirror which she holds high in her extended right hand. The foreground of the canvas is thronged with a swarm of male infants, or putti, who distract themselves in activities such as climbing trees, leaping, flying, gathering apples, lying around, fighting, fondling, shooting arrows and pulling each other's hair. A dam is shown in the middle background, near a sunlit meadow. The far distance is decorated with a mountain and blue sky.\r Titian based the image on the writings of the Greek sophist Philostratus. In his \"Imagines I, VI\", Philostratus wrote, \"See cupids are gathering apples: and if there are many of them, do not be surprised...The cupids' quiver are studded with gold, and golden also are the darts in them...they have hung their quivers on the apple trees; and in the grass lie their broidered mantles...Ah, the baskets into which they gather their apples!\"\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Violante\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/violante-1518\n\nWikipedia Article:\nViolante is an oil painting attributed to Titian, dated to around 1515 and now held at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.\r The work was part of the Venetian collection of Bartolomeo della Nave and in 1636, it was sold to the Duke of Hamilton, who brought it to London. In 1659, it was acquired by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, whose collection later became part of the current museum.\r The title refers to the traditional identification with Violante, the daughter of painter Palma the Elder (to whom the painting was assigned for a long time), which has however no proof. An etching by David Teniers the Younger show the painting having larger size, although a representation of the archduke's gallery from the same artist depicts it in the same current size.

Designed by Tullio of Antonio Lombardo, it was completed in 1519 and frescoed by Il Pordenone until 1520. The decoration was completed in around 1523, and this Annunciation was executed by Titian around that period, perhaps with the help of Paris Bordone.\r The face of the donor was possibly repainted after 1526. Lorenzo Lotto was inspired by this work for his Recanati Annunciation.\r The painting depicts the Annunciation in a church with a chessboard pavement. Titian, instead of painting the angel on the left and Mary on the right as usual, moved the Madonna into the foreground with the angel behind, pushed towards Mary by the divine light behind him.

Sometime after his beheading in 1649, the painting was auctioned and bought by the Cologne banker Eberhard Jabach . Eventually it came in the possession of Louis XIV of France, and was transferred from the Palace of Versailles to the Louvre in 1792.\r The figure has not been identified with certainty. He could be Girolamo Adorno, mentioned in a 1527 letter from Pietro Aretino to Federico Gonzaga, or Giambattista Malatesta, an agent of the Gonzaga in Venice. According to another hypothesis, he could be Ferrante Gonzaga, who was sixteen years old in 1523.\r The painting portrays a three-quarters view of a male figure set against a flat black background. He appears to be looking at an indefinite point to the left of the canvas, with his left arm laid on his knee. He could be pointing at his gloves, which were a fashion statement at the time - much like large muscles are today. He is dressed in a wide jacket and a white shirt, in the fashion of the period.\r The man's gloved left hand holds a second leather glove; an accessory used by the most refined gentlemen of the time. His right hand is adorned with a golden ring, a symbol of richness, and a necklace decorated with a sapphire and a pearl.

The painting can be seen as one of a number of Venetian paintings of the 1510s showing two or three half-length figures with heads close together, often with their expressions and interactions enigmatic. Most of these are \"Giorgionesque\" genre or tronie subjects where the subjects are anonymous, though the group includes Titian's The Tribute Money, with Christ as the main figure, which in terms of style is similar to this painting, and his Lucretia and her Husband, also in Vienna, where at least the woman's identity is clear, if not that of the man.\r Alternative attributions are to Giorgione (in the past) and Palma Vecchio.\r Against a dark background two male figures are shown, one in front of the other, with the rear one looking over his shoulder at a foreground figure who is tapping his shoulder, making him turn sharply. This foreground figure is dressed in armour and his other hand hides a dagger or a sword of which we see only the hilt, suggesting an attack is imminent. The rear figure is a young man with flowing blonde hair, wearing a garland of vine leaves on his head, who has also reached for his weapon, the hilt dimly visible at bottom centre. The foreground figure has his head turned away from the viewer.\r Various attempts have been made to assign the scene to a specific incident in myth or history. One suggestion is the arrest of Bacchus's follower Acoetes by Pentheus, king of Thebes, which would explain the wreath of vine-leaves in his hair. An x-ray of the painting showed that the head of the man on the right (the foreground figure) once wore a crown.\r The painting was probably in the Venetian collection of Zuanantonio Venier in 1526, who had one then described as \"two half-figures attacking each other by Titian\". In 1636 it was sold to the Duke of Hamilton, who brought it to London. Most of his purchases were from the collection of Bartolomeo della Nave, who perhaps had it by then. After Hamilton's execution, it was acquired by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, whose collection later became part of the Habsburg imperial collection in Vienna, then passed to the Kunsthistorisches Museum.\r An etching after a reduced copy by David Teniers the Younger shows the painting attributed to Giorgione.

Venus, said to have been born from a shell, is identified by the shell at bottom left. It is smaller than usual in the birth of Venus scenes, such as Botticelli's, and is just intended to identify the subject rather than be a boat-like vessel for Venus, as in Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus and other depictions.\r The voluptuousness of the Venus presented, and her sideways glance, also owes much to the Crouching Venus and Cnidian Venus types of antique sculpture. The wringing of her hair is a direct imitation of Apelles's lost masterwork of the same title. Titian deliberately included this detail to prove that he could rival the art of antiquity in which the goddess was also washing her hair \u2014 a fact mentioned in Pliny's Natural History.\r The painting is in exceptionally fine condition. It was once owned by Christina of Sweden, and passed via the Orleans Collection to 6th Duke of Sutherland, who lent it and 26 other paintings to the National Galleries of Scotland in 1945.

The work was delivered in 1522, as testified by Titian's signature in the lower right panel. The large polyptych was placed at the high altar of the church of Santi Nazaro e Celso of Brescia, then part of the Venetian mainland possessions, replacing another altarpiece by Vincenzo Foppa (of which now a Nativity of Jesus remains in the church of Santa Maria Assunta at Chiesanuova, as well as two side panels in the Pinacoteca Tosio Martinengo).\r A first version of the St. Sebastian panel was offered to Alfonso d'Este of Ferrara as a compensation for his late in the realization of the Bacchanalia. The Duke declined the offer, and the early St. Sebastian was perhaps sent to Mantua, where one such painting is mentioned among the artworks sold by the Gonzaga to Charles I of England, although it is no more known afterwards.\r Averoldi subsequently also started to complain about the lateness of delivery.\r The use of compartment-divided polyptych, a solution rather old fashioned for the time, was surely an explicit demand of Averoldi. Titian obtained anyway a certain degree of unity, although not a spatial or architectural one as in the 15th century polyptychs: the Veneto painter adopted instead a chromatic-dynamic and light convergence towards the central scene.\r The panels are:\r The work inspired several Brescian Renaissance painters, including Savoldo and Moretto\r The central scene depicts a triumphant and blazing Christ above a dawn dark yellow and grey sky, who holds the Crusader banner as an emblem of the Christian Catholic church. Under him is a group of soldiers with armors.\r The work shows the influence of Raphael's works such as the Transfiguration (the centripetal position of Christ) and the fresco of the Deliverance of Saint Peter for the quasi-night atmosphere Another possible influence is that of Danube school, in details such as the landscape illumination and the northern European fashion of the ideal Jerusalem in the background.\r The left panel show the saints Nazarius and Celsus, to which the church housing the altar was dedicated, on a gloomy background. Nazarius wear a shining armor, while his disciple, Celsus, is behind him. The kneeling donoris averoldi the then papal legate to venice is portrayed from profile, and is stylistically reminiscent of the depiction of Sigismondo de' Conti in Raphael's Madonna of Foligno. The influence of Titian's master, Giorgione, is also visible in the calm atmosphere and the dull colors.\r The right panel shows the traditional Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, although in this case the saint is depicted in a rather contorted position which likely derived from Michelangelo's Punishment of Aman in the Sistine Chapel ceiling, or from Raphael's Fire of Borgo also in the Vatican. The arms are tied to a trunk at different heights, while the legs are also differently articulated due to the presence of a column section.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Bacchus and Ariadne\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/bacchus-and-ariadne-1523\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBacchus and Ariadne (1522\u20131523) is an oil painting by Titian. It is one of a cycle of paintings on mythological subjects produced for Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, for the Camerino d'Alabastro\u00a0\u2013 a private room in his palazzo in Ferrara decorated with paintings based on classical texts. An advance payment was given to Raphael, who originally held the commission for the subject of a Triumph of Bacchus. At the time of Raphael's death in 1520, only a preliminary drawing was completed and the commission was then handed to Titian. In the case of Bacchus and Ariadne, the subject matter was derived from the Roman poets Catullus and Ovid.\r The painting, considered one of Titian's greatest works, now hangs in the National Gallery in London. The other major paintings in the cycle are The Feast of the Gods (mostly by Giovanni Bellini, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C), and Titian's The Bacchanal of the Andrians and The Worship of Venus (both now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid).\r Ariadne has been left on the island of Naxos, deserted by her lover Theseus, whose ship sails away to the far left. She is discovered on the shore by the god Bacchus, leading a procession of revelers in a chariot drawn by two cheetahs (These were probably modelled on those in the Duke's menagerie and were tigers in Ovid's original text). Bacchus is depicted in mid-air as he leaps out of the chariot to protect Ariadne from these beasts. In the sky above the figure of Ariadne is the star constellation Corona Borealis (Northern crown). There are two possible variations of the story both going back to Ovid. In his Metamorphoses, Ovid has Bacchus throw the crown of Ariadne into the sky where it becomes the constellation Northern Crown. In Ars Amatoria, Bacchus promises the entire sky to Ariadne where she then would become the constellation Northern Crown. The National Gallery's website states that in the painting, 'Bacchus, god of wine, emerges with his followers from the landscape to the right. Falling in love with Ariadne on first sight, he leaps from his chariot, drawn by two cheetahs, towards her. Ariadne had been abandoned on the Greek island of Naxos by Theseus, whose ship is shown in the distance. The picture shows her initial fear of Bacchus, but he raised her to heaven and turned her into a constellation, represented by the stars above her head.'\r The composition is divided diagonally into two triangles, one of blue sky (using the expensive ultramarine pigment) and still but for the two lovers caught in movement, the other a riot of movement and predominantly green/brown in colour. The follower of Bacchus who struggles with a snake is sometimes falsely associated with the antique sculpture of Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons who had been killed by snakes. This statue had recently been discovered in Rome. But the satyr in Titian's painting is not in a mortal combat with the snakes, he is merely girding himself with them as is described in the original text by Catullus. The King Charles Spaniel that barks at the boy satyr is a common motif in Titian's work and was probably a court pet. The gold urn inscribed with the artist's signature (TICIANVS) may also have been familiar to the Duke as one of the antiquities in his collection.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Laura de Dianti\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/portrait-of-laura-de-dianti\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Laura Dianti is a c. 1520\u201325 painting by Titian, now held in the H. Kisters Collection at Kreuzlingen. It is signed \"TICI/ANVS F.\" and depicts Laura Dianti, lover and later wife of Alfonso I d'Este.\r Titian painted several portraits of Dianti, perhaps including the Woman with a Mirror, now at the Louvre. In this one, she wears a sumptuous blue dress, jewellery and a diadem. Her right arm runs down the side of her body while her left hand rests on the shoulder of an African page boy.\r Vasari mentions a portrait of Dianti, which was engraved by E. Sadler. Ridolfi, in 1648, described the work based on the engraving. There are several copies and versions of the painting, one of which (generally thought to be the autograph version) was sent in 1599 from Cesare d'Este to Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor in Prague. In 1649, it was in the collection of Christina of Sweden, who brought it to Rome in 1654. It then passed into the collections of Decio Azzolino, then (in 1686) of prince Odescalchi, then (in 1721) Philip of Orleans. In 1800, it was in an English collection and in 1876, it was in the Cook collection before arriving in the Kisters collection in Kreuzlingen.\r Modern criticism previously held the work to be an autograph copy of a lost original, like the versions at the Galleria Estense in Modena, the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, the Galleria Borghese in Rome and several private collections. After a restoration in America, which revealed the signature on the sleeve, it is again thought to be the original work. The work was paired with a portrait of Alfonso I d'Este, which is now lost but of which several copies survive, the best perhaps being that at the Metropolitan Museum in New York City.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: The Bacchanal of the Andrians\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/bacchanal-1524\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Bacchanal of the Andrians is an oil painting by Titian.

Jacopo was Bishop of Paphos, in Cyprus, and had been named commander of the papal fleet by the Borgia pope, Alexander VI. This painting recalls one of Titian's earliest paintings Jacopo Pesaro being presented by Pope Alexander VI to Saint Peter, c. 1510-11\r Titian shows his patron in a devotional pose, kneeling before the Virgin and presented to her by Saint Peter. Prominently displayed on the step is Saint Peter's key; its diagonal plane, leading toward the Virgin, parallels that of Jacopo. The Virgin's position at the top of the steps alludes to her celestial role as Madonna della Scala (Madonna of the Stairs) and as the Stairway to Heaven. Titian actually used his wife, who died in childbirth soon after, as the model for the Virgin Mary in this work.\r The large red banner at the far left prominently displays the papal arms in the center and those of Jacopo below. Also displayed is a laurel branch, a symbol of victory. An unidentified knight has two prisoners in tow, a turbaned Turk and a Moor, probably a reference to Jacopo's victory over the Turks in 1502. At the right, Saint Francis of Assisi links the five kneeling Pesaro family members to Christ, suggesting that through his own route of identification with Christ salvation can be achieved. Just behind Saint Francis is Saint Anthony of Padua - both, like Saint Bernardino, are Franciscans, as is the church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari.\r The members of the donor's family are motionless. All the other figures gesture energetically and occupy diagonal planes. The steps, surmounted by large columns cut off at the top, are thrust diagonally back into space. Infant angels appear on the cloud above. One seen in rear view holds the Cross. The back of this angel is juxtaposed with the infant Christ, who turns playfully on Mary's lap and looks down at Saint Francis, who returns his gaze. The fabrics are characteristically rich and textured, particularly the flag and costumes. This attention to material textures is further enhanced by the variation of bright lights and dark accents in the sky. The light of Venice, sparkling in its waterways, seems to illuminate this painting.\r When Titian painted this altarpiece, he broke with a centuries-long tradition of placing the devotional figures (the Virgin and Child) in the center of the painting and the painted space. By doing this, he allowed for a greater sense of movement through the painting, presaging the Baroque period's more complicated compositional techniques. The painting is particularly innovative and shows an example of developed High-Renaissance style, as Titian has used diagonal and triangular principles to draw the viewer's eye up to the Madonna and Child, thus creating hierarchy within the work and shows that the Pesaro family are pious.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Madonna Aldobrandini\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/madonna-aldobrandini-1530\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna of the Rabbit, The Aldobrandini Madonna, The Virgin and Child with the Infant Saint John and a Female Saint or Donor or The Virgin and Child with the Infant Saint John and Saint Catherine is an oil on canvas painting by Titian dating to around 1530 and now held in the National Gallery in London. There are studio copies in the Galleria Palatina in Florence and in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.\r Frizzoni proposed identifying this Madonna with the one mentioned in 1532 by Marcantonio Michiel in the Venetian house of Andrea Odoni (subject of a portrait by Lotto), while Tietze thought it was one of three paintings commissioned from Titian by Federico Gonzaga in 1530. It was in the sacristy of the Escorial Monastery before coming to Paris in the 19th century.

It shows the Marquess of Mantua, Isabella d'Este (1474\u20131539), daughter of Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, and Eleanor of Naples with an ermine zibellino draped over her shoulder.\r Although Titian depicts her as a young woman, she was around 62 at the time  Isabella was socially ambitious and aware of the effect a painting by a renowned artists might have on her reputation and prestige - she also commissioned portraits by Leonardo da Vinci and Andrea Mantegna.\r It is one of two portraits Titian painted of her; Isabella in Red (or Aged Isabella) of 1529 is known only through a Peter Paul Rubens copy. It showed a more aged and matronly Isabella, but she was so displeased with the picture that she asked for a second idealised portrait, showing how she thought she looked forty years earlier. Art historian Lionel Cust mentions that Isabella's fame and renown was not due to \"beauty, but to intellect and character\". Fred Kleiner wrote that the work is a \"distinctive portrayal of his poised and self-assured patron that owes little to its model\". It is today in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.\r Isabella was portrayed a number times in her youth. She was betrothed to Francesco Gonzaga in 1480 when she was 6; they married when she was 16. She was painted by Cosme Tura as a child and on a number of occasions around the time of her wedding, a period during which she was honoured by the striking of a commemorative medal. She was critical of a portrait by Andrea Mantegna completed after 1493, and by the 1510s became very weary of representations of her likeness. She seems to have feared the effects of age, and a short woman, worried she was getting stout.\r She retained very strong ideas for the rest of her life as to how she should be portrayed. From the 1520s she asked that she be painted from written descriptions - with the rationale that words captured more closely a person's essence than life sittings. This was convenient for Titian, who was much sought after as a portraitist, disliked travel, and anyway prided himself on the fact that he could capture a likeness from written description. Nonetheless, she rejected his first portrait, the now lost Isabella in red of 1529, feeling it did not flatter, and five years later asked that he paint a second. The complaints registered of the first painting indicate that the last thing sought by the patron was anything approaching a likeness. There was displeasure with the portrayal of her nose, posture, costume, facial expression, and the highlighting of her squint.\r Isabella sought to influence Titian by sending him a 1511 portrait painted by Francesco Francia, which shows her as a young woman and highlighted her girlish beauty. This work was in turn based on an even earlier portrait (probably Lorenzo Costa or Leonardo's drawing) and her half-sister Lucrezia d'Este-Bentivoglio's oral description. Francia was given the opportunity to travel to Mantua so that Isabella could sit, but he declined, believing that he would paint better from the drawing and written description. This was convenient for Isabella, who wrote to him that he had \"indeed made us far more beautiful by your art than nature ever made us\". Yet she had later doubts that this work was how she was to be definitely seen and remembered by; she believed it made her eyes look \"too black\" and that the shadows were too heavy, and asked that both be lightened.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Venus of Urbino\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/venus-of-urbino-1538\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Venus of Urbino (also known as Reclining Venus) is an oil painting by the Italian painter Titian, which seems to have been begun in 1532 or 1534, and was perhaps completed in 1534, but not sold until 1538. It depicts a nude young woman, traditionally identified with the goddess Venus, reclining on a couch or bed in the sumptuous surroundings of a Renaissance palace. It is now in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence.\r The figure's pose is based on the Dresden Venus, traditionally attributed to Giorgione but which Titian at least completed. In this depiction, Titian has domesticated Venus by moving her to an indoor setting, engaging her with the viewer, and making her sensuality explicit. Devoid as it is of any classical or allegorical trappings \u2013 Venus displays none of the attributes of the goddess she is supposed to represent \u2013 the painting is sensual and unapologetically erotic.\r Interpretations of the painting fall into two groups. Both agree that the painting has a powerful erotic charge, but beyond that it is seen either as a portrait of a courtesan, perhaps Zaffetta, or as a painting celebrating the marriage of its first owner (who according to some may not have commissioned it). This disagreement forms part of a wider debate on the meaning of the mainly Venetian tradition of the reclining female nude, which Titian had created, or helped to create, some 25 years before with the Dresden Venus of around 1510-11. For Charles Hope, \"It has yet to be shown that the most famous example of this genre, Titian's Venus of Urbino, is anything other than a representation of a beautiful nude woman on a bed, devoid of classical or even allegorical content.\" Even the indefatigable finder of allegories drawing on Renaissance Neoplatonism, Edgar Wind, had to admit that in this case \"an undisguised hedonism had at last dispelled the Platonic metaphors\".\r The Venus stares straight at the viewer, unconcerned with her nudity. In her right hand she holds a posy of roses whilst she holds her other hand over her genitals. In the near background is a dog, often a symbol of fidelity. In a different space in the background two maids are shown rummaging through a cassone chest, where clothes were kept.\r The detailed depiction of the interior setting is unusual, perhaps unique, in Titian. Titian contr32 for the 21 year old Ippolito de' Medici, reluctantly made a cardinal (though not a priest), by his uncle, Pope Clement VII. He was trying to pursue a military career, and was a papal diplomat. On 20 October 1532 he spent the night in Venice with Angela del Moro, or Angela Zaffetta, a leading courtesan in Venice and sometimes a dining companion of Titian and Aretino, the latter a friend of the cardinal. Titian painted Ippolito's portrait, and it seems likely that he was asked to add a nude portrait of Angela Zaffetta, or that Titian decided to paint one in the hope he would like it.\r On 20 December 1534 Titian wrote to Ippolito's chamberlain in Rome saying that he had been working on a painting of a woman for the cardinal. Ippolito died in August 1535, and apparently never saw the painting, which was still Titian's studio when Guidobaldo II della Rovere, the 24-year-old son of the Duke of Urbino came in January 1538 to sit for a portrait. As letters from him and his mother show, he was extremely keen to buy it, and did so some months later; he refers to it simply as \"the nude woman\", and was worried Titian would sell it to someone else. Later that year he inherited the Duchy of Urbino on the death of his father, hence the painting acquired the name by which it is usually known, although it seems it was mostly kept in Pesaro from early on.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Presentation of the Virgin at the Temple\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/presentation-of-the-virgin-at-the-temple-1539\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Presentation of the Virgin at the Temple is a 1534\u20131538 painting by Titian.

Alfonso d'Avalos, Marquise del Vasto, was a noble Neapolitan, descended from a family of Castilian origin. He participated in the Battle of Pavia and the conquest of Tunis in 1535. In 1538 he was appointed governor of Milan. Military failures caused a subsequent falling out of favor with the Emperor Charles V.\r This work is both a portrait of the Marquis del Vasto and a picture of history narrating an incident that occurred in 1537. The Spanish troops stationed in Milan began an attempted mutiny over not receiving their pay, but the conflict was suppressed by the Marquis' eloquent speech to the men that inspired loyalty and guaranteed their pay given patience. He, having to leave for affairs elsewhere, left his son with the troops as a guarantee they would be paid.\r The marquis contracted Titian to paint the scene, depicting his son as a page holding his helmet for him during the speech. The composition is based on classical models, such as the reliefs of the Arch of Constantine and numerous Numismatic works. Titian features the General in an elevated position, addressing his men, and emphasizing his words, as advised classical oratory manuals, with elevation of the right arm.\r The work was commissioned in 1539 by the Marquis himself, during a trip to Venice. His first public exhibition was in Milan during 1541, taking advantage of the visit of Emperor Charles. It was subsequently acquired by the Gonzaga family, the Dukes of Mantua, and finally by King Charles I of England. When this King was executed his assets were auctioned, and the painting (like others of the same king) was acquired by Philip IV of Spain.

The scene is based on the mythological princess Dana\u00eb, as -very briefly- recounted by the Roman poet Ovid, and at greater length by Boccaccio. She was isolated in a bronze tower following a prophecy that her firstborn would eventually kill her father. Although aware of the consequences, Dana\u00eb was seduced and became pregnant by Zeus (in Roman mythology Jupiter), who, inflamed by lust, descended from Mount Olympus to seduce her in the form of a shower of gold.\r Titian and his workshop produced at least six versions of the painting, which vary to degrees. The major surviving versions are in Naples, London, Madrid, Vienna, Chicago, and St. Petersburg. The voluptuous figure of Dana\u00eb, with legs half spread, hardly changes, and was probably traced from a studio drawing or version. Her bed and its hangings are another constant. Other elements vary considerably; the first version, now in Naples, was painted between 1544-46, and is the only one with a figure of Cupid at the right, rather than an old woman catching the shower of gold. She is a different figure at each appearance, though the pose in the Hermitage follows the Prado version. The small dog resting at Dana\u00eb's side in the Prado and Chicago versions is generally absent.\r The works influenced the compositions of many artists including Rembrandt, Anthony van Dyck and Gustav Klimt, who all painted versions of the scene. Giorgio Vasari recounts a visit with Michelangelo to Titian's studio, where they saw the original in progress. Michelangelo praised Titian's use of colour in the Madrid painting, though later, in private, he was critical of Titian's draftsmanship.\r According to Greek mythology, as it would have been known to Titian through Ovid's Metamorphoses, Boccaccio's Genealogia Deorum Gentilium, and probably Terence, when her father Acrisius consulted the oracle on how he would get male children, he was told that his daughter would bear a son who would kill him. Acrisius then locked up and guarded his daughter Dana\u00eb in a subterranean dungeon, or alternatively a windowless tower room - a detail Titian ignores in most versions, giving a view at least to the sky on the right of the picture. Dana\u00eb, aware of the consequences, allowed herself to be seduced and impregnated by Zeus, who broke through the defences by appearing in the form of a shower of gold, which in ancient times had already been envisaged as a shower of gold coins, and the myth taken as a metaphor for prostitution, although the parallels with conventional depictions of the Annunciation were also part of Renaissance awareness.\r When Acrisius learned of Dana\u00eb's son Perseus, he refused to believe Zeus's role, and cast mother and child adrift at sea in a chest. They landed at Seriphus, where Perseus was raised by Dictys. Perseus eventually fulfilled the prophecy by killing Acrisius years after\u2014although accidentally. Dana\u00eb was seen in the Middle Ages and Renaissance as a symbol of the corrupting effect of wealth, which could taint even feminine beauty or moral virtue.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Pope Paul III, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and Duke Ottavio Farnese\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/portrait-of-pope-paul-iii-cardinal-alessandro-farnese-and-duke-ottavio-farnese-1546\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPope Paul III and His Grandsons (Italian: Paolo III e i nipoti Alessandro e Ottavio Farnese) is a painting in oil on canvas by Titian, housed in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples. It was commissioned by the Farnese family and painted during Titian's visit to Rome between autumn 1545 and June 1546. It depicts the thorny relationship between Pope Paul III, born Alessandro Farnese, and two of his grandsons, Ottavio and Alessandro. Ottavio is shown in the act of kneeling, to his left; Alessandro, wearing a cardinal's dress, stands behind him to his right. The painting explores the effects of ageing and the manoeuvring behind succession; Paul was at the time in his late seventies and operating within an uncertain political climate as Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, came into ascendancy.\r Paul was not a religious man; he viewed the papacy as a means to consolidate his family's position. He appointed Alessandro as cardinal against accusations of nepotism, fathered a number of illegitimate children, and spent large sums of church money collecting art and antiquities. Around 1545 Charles took the political and military advantage, weakening Paul's hold on the papacy. Aware of the changing tides of influence, Titian abandoned the commission before completion, and for the next 100 years the painting languished unframed in a Farnese cellar.\r Pope Paul III and His Grandsons ranks as one of Titian's finest and most penetrating works. Although unfinished and less technically accomplished than his Portrait of Pope Paul III of a few years earlier, it is renowned for its rich colouring; the deep reds of the tablecloth and the almost spectral whites of Paul's gown. The panel contains subtle indications of the contradictions in the character of the Pope, and captures the complex psychological dynamic between the three men.\r Alessandro Farnese, as Paul III, was the last of the popes appointed by the ruling Medici family of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and not particularly pious. He kept a concubine, fathered four children out of wedlock and viewed the throne as an opportunity to fill his coffers while he placed his relatives in high positions. A talented and cunning political operator, Paul was precisely the sort of man the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.\r He became pope in 1534 when he was 66 years old, and immediately appointed members of his family to key positions. He anointed his eldest grandson Alessandro, the eldest child of his illegitimate son Pier Luigi, cardinal at the age of 14, marking a break with the Farnese tradition of marrying off the first-born to carry on the family name. This move was considered necessary because the next oldest grandson, Ottavio, was then just 10 years old; such a young cardinal would have been politically unacceptable. Paul's advanced years meant that the family could ill afford to wait until the younger brother was of age. Thus Alessandro became a cardinal deacon; this appointment did not necessitate taking major orders, but it compelled him to celibacy and to forgo the rights of primogeniture, which instead went to Ottavio. Alessandro was to bitterly regret the obligations. Paul appointed Ottavio as Duke of Camerino in 1538, and in the same year married him to Charles V's daughter, Margaret, later Margaret of Parma. Both of Paul's grandsons' advancements were widely criticised as evidence of nepotism.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Emperor Charles V at Muhlberg\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/emperor-charles-1548-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nEquestrian Portrait of Charles V (also Emperor Charles V on Horseback or Charles V at M\u00fchlberg) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Titian. Created between April and September 1548 while Titian was at the imperial court of Augsburg, it is a tribute to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, following his victory in the April 1547 Battle of M\u00fchlberg against the Protestant armies.\r The portrait in part gains its impact by its directness and sense of contained power: the horse's strength seems just in check, and Charles' brilliantly shining armour and the painting's deep reds are reminders of battle and heroism. Titian recorded all of the foreground elements\u2014the horse, its caparison, and the rider's armour\u2014from those used in the actual battle. Both the armour and harness survive, and are kept at the Royal Armoury in Madrid.\r It was acquired by the Museo del Prado in 1827.\r The portrait was commissioned by Mary of Austria, Queen of Hungary, with Charles specifying how he wished to be presented. The emperor was very aware of the importance of portraiture in determining how he was seen by others, and appreciated not only Titian's mastery as a painter, but also the artist's manner of presenting him as a ruler.\r Titian came to know Charles V personally, and had painted a number of portraits of him by this time. A highly intelligent man, Titian was quick witted, humorous and easy company. He had developed such a strong friendship with Charles by the time of this portrait that the emperor's courtiers were uneasy at the extent that a lowly painter was allowed into his confidence. While in Augsburg, Titian was given an apartment close to Charles' own, and allowed easy access and frequent meetings with the emperor.\r The painting contains a mix of styles; passages such as the armor and harness display the realism of Titian's early work, while the trees, landscape and sky are built from the broad stretches of colour and strong brushstrokes associated with his work from the 1540s on. It contains surprisingly few iconographic elements. Pietro Aretino, a contemporary writer whom Titian painted, suggested that he incorporate conventional references to religion and fame. Symbolism and iconography are not absent; the lance alludes to Saint George, the exemplar of the \"traditional image of a military knight-saint\". The red around Charles' helmet, his sash and on the horse's trim, represents the Catholic faith in the wars of the 16th century. Titian was so keen to capture such vivid reds that he requested a half pound of red lake be brought from Venice to Augsburg. His instruction reveals that he regarded that pigment \"so burning and so splendid...that in comparison the crimson on velvet and silk will become less beautiful\".\r Drawing on sources such as Roman military art (the statue of Marcus Aurelius on horseback), Renaissance equestrian imagery such as the engravings of Hans Burgkmair, and possibly D\u00fcrer's 1513 engraving Knight, Death and the Devil, Titian departs from the traditional rendering of rider on horse, in which one of the horse's front legs is raised (as seen in the gallery of Roman and Renaissance works below). Instead, the horse rears slightly, or may be striking off into a canter, with only its hind legs touching the ground, while Charles still holds the reins lightly, upright but at ease, implying his advanced horsemanship. The influence of the D\u00fcrer engraving is subtle. D\u00fcrer's knight rides through dark woods, passing figures representing evil and mortality, including a pig-snouted devil and death riding a pale horse. In contrast Charles emerges from a dark wood into an open, though brooding landscape.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: The Punishment of Tythus\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/tityus-1549\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Punishment of Tythus is a mythological painting by Titian dating to 1549 and now in the Museo del Prado.

In all there are some thirty versions that may date from the 16th century, the nudity of Venus undoubtedly accounting for this popularity. It is unclear which of the surviving versions, if any, is the original or prime version, and a matter of debate how much involvement Titian himself had with surviving versions. There is a precise date for only one version, that in the Prado in Madrid, which is documented in correspondence between Titian and Philip II of Spain in 1554. However, this appears to be a later repetition of a composition first painted a considerable time earlier, possibly as early as the 1520s.\r The Prado version is set at dawn and shows the young Adonis pulling himself away from Venus, his lover. He carries a feathered spear or \"dart\", a weapon often used in hunting in the 16th century. The leads of his three hounds are wound around his arm at right. Under the trees behind them at left Cupid lies asleep, with his bow and quiver of arrows hanging from a tree; this is not a time for love. High in the sky, a figure rides a chariot; this is either Venus from later in the story, or Apollo or Sol, representing the dawn. Venus sits on a rock covered with a rich tablecloth with gold braid edges and buttons (not a military jacket, as sometimes thought). Adonis has a horn hanging from his belt; his dress is classical, taken from Roman sculptures.\r It is thought that the Roman poet Ovid was the main source, though other literary and visual sources have been suggested. In Book X of Ovid's Metamorphoses Adonis is a beautiful youth, a royal orphan, who spends his time hunting. Venus falls in love with him after one of Cupid's arrows hits her by mistake. They hunt together, but she avoids the fiercer animals, and warns him about them, citing the story of Atalanta. One day Adonis hunts alone and is gored by a wounded wild boar. Venus, in the sky in her chariot, hears his cries but cannot save him. In some versions, the death of Adonis is shown in the distance to the right. In Ovid, it is Venus who leaves first, and Adonis pulling himself away seems to be Titian's invention, for which some criticized him.\r Two basic types of the composition were described by Harold Wethey, who called them the \"Prado\" and \"Farnese\" types; the Prado type is most common and is described above. Alternative terms are the \"three-dog\" and \"two-dog\" types. They are in most respects the same, but the Farnese type has a tighter crop on the subject and a wider shape, losing most of the sky. Adonis' raised hand is just below the picture edge, so the feathers on the spear are not seen, nor is the chariot in the sky, though the sun bursts through clouds in about the same place. There are only two hounds and no gold vessel on the ground at left.

It was copied by several later artists, including Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck.\r Titian made a number of paintings of the same subject, but this is the believed to be the earliest and the only version to be entirely by the hand of Titian, without additions by his assistants. it remained in his house until his death in 1576.\r X-rays of the painting have revealed that Titian painted it over a double portrait which he had abandoned. Titian kept the red cloak of one of the figures in the abandoned painting and placed it under Venus's arm. The use of the cloak from the earlier painting probably played a large part in the composition of the new painting.\r Titian is believed to have made another version of this Venus for the Venetian lawyer Niccolo Crasso, who also commissioned Titian to paint the Retable of Saint Nicholas de Bari at about the same time. A drawing of the other version was included by Anthony van Dyck in the sketchbook made during his trip to Italy. This other version is now lost, but a studio copy exists in the Hermitage Museum.\r Titian is thought to have made a second copy, which was sent to his regular patron King Philip II of Spain, in 1567. This version was also lost, but a copy of it by Peter Paul Rubens exists, which is in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid.\r In 1581, five years after Titian's death, the contents of his house in Venice, including the Venus with a Mirror, were sold by his son and heir Pomponio Vechellio to Christoforo Barbarigo. In 1850 the Russian Consul-General in Venice, A. Kvostov, purchased the painting, along with a large number of other masterpieces, from the Barbarigo family, for Czar Nicholas I for the sum of 525,000 francs, and it entered the collection of the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.\r In 1931, in order to earn foreign currency for the first of the Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin and the Soviet government secretly sold the painting, along with a number of other masterpieces, to a syndicate of art dealers, who sold it to the American collector Andrew Mellon, who wished to create a national art museum for the United States.

The oil-on-canvas painting measures 178 by 205 centimetres (70\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a081\u00a0in).\r The title of the painting refers to the mythological story of the abduction of Europa by Zeus (Jupiter to the Romans), Titian is unequivocal about the fact that this is a scene of rape (abduction): Europa is sprawled helplessly on her back, her clothes in disarray. In the myth, the god assumed the form of a bull and enticed Europa to climb onto his back. Once there, the bull rode into the sea and carried her to Crete, where he revealed his real identity. Europa became the first Queen of Crete, and had three children with Zeus.

While he is known to have painted a number of independent self-portraits in various formats, this is one of only two painted examples to survive. The other is in Madrid, dated c. 1560. Both share a somber and reserved pallet, although this example is richer in tonal variation and colour harmonisation.\r It is unfinished, with his left hand, areas of his clothing only sketched and only roughly sketched. It has been suggested that the canvas is a modello, or study, for another now lost work. An other theory is that it was painted for family members for his memory after he died.\r Thematically and stylistically, the work can be associated with his 1545 Portrait of Pietro Aretino. A number of versions or variants exist, including drawings from his own hand, and paintings attributed to his workshop.\r Parts of the canvas are unfinished, especially the hands, the dark area around his face, and the drapery. It remained in Titian's studio in the Biri Grande, Venice, until his death, which some art historian see as evidence that it was intended as a study, although it may just have been simply because it was unfinished.\r The Italian painter, architect, and writer Giorgio Vasari wrote in 1568 that Titian had made a number of self-portraits for his family to remember him by, and it is likely that this was one, given that it was not sold in his lifetime. However Vasari dates the portrait to c. 1562-64, this work more closely corresponds to a records of a version of a portrait given to Paolo Giovio in 1549.\r The painting's style is reminiscent of Titian's work of around 1560, especially the thick and irregular application of white paint in large sections.  He seems to be around 60 years old, giving credence to the earlier dating. He wears the golden chain of the Order of the Golden Spur, wrapped in three strands, which was given to him by the Emperor Charles V in 1533. The chain is intended to signify his knighthood and elevated social status. He wears a black cap in both paintings; a motif seen a number of other of his later works. While the origins of the motif are unknown, it is probably intend to connect him with scholarship; similar headgear is often associated with Aristotle and St Jerome. A further explanation is that he sough to cover up a bald spot.\r The portrait is in half length, with Titian in three-quarters profile view, seated behind a table, looking out into the distance. Although his expression is complex and hard to properly interpret, it can be viewed as a more outward looking and optimistic expression the 1567 Madrid self-portrait, and a number of art historians note the aging and physical decline he had undergone by the time of the later work. As with all of his independent self-portraits, he is looking to the side, avoiding the viewer, possibly out of humility, but in a dignified pose. He is shown with strong shoulders and a keen, alert gaze, in which some detect an air \"of combativeness...disquietude...and misgiving\".\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Annunciation\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/annunciation-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Annunciation is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Titian, executed between 1559 and 1564. It remains in the church of San Salvador in Venice, for which it was commissioned.\r Originally three paintings were commissioned by the D'Anna family for their chapels in the church of San Salvador in Venice, northern Italy. Only two out of the three remains in place in the church. The other pieces that were commissioned were a Transfiguration dated around 1560, as the altarpiece of the high altar, and a Crucifixion now in the Church of San Domenico, Ancona. The painting depicts the scene when the Virgin Mary being told that she is carrying the child of God, called the Annunciation of the Virgin.\r The lower figures are Mary (mother of Jesus) and Gabriel. Mary is in shown in a degree of shock but Titian using his colours brings out the sight of the angel. This is most evident in his handling of light. A heavenly light pours from an opening in the sky into the place of the Annunciation.\r There have been opinions on the different usage of colour in the painting from Giorgio Vasari to Charles Hope. Hope's opinion \u201ddisliked use of the muddy colours, the physical types, the mannered pose of the Virgin or the badly drawn figure of Gabriel and the inept use of gesture\u201d. Hope's observation is an extension from Vasari's criticism. While Bohde explains that \"muddy colours\" and the physicality of the figures makes the composition of Titian's Annunciation so good.\r Bohde says, \"Titian\u2019s painting ultimately deals with the transformation of the immaterial into the material, which is the core of the incarnation theme\". The figures itself explains the main theme of incarnation of God within the Virgin. This theme comes thought with the dove in the back that pours out amounts of light from the clouds. The figures itself explains the main theme of incarnation of God within the Virgin. This theme comes through with the painted dove in the back that pours out vast amounts of light from the clouds. The figures are different from other versions of the story annunciation in other Venetian works Titian does not connect to the myth of the city of Venice founded on the day of Annunziata. As Bohde states \"Titian merely connects the place of the Annunciation with the interior of San Salvador through the red and white tiled floor and the row of columns. But these features mainly serve to unify the pictorial and the real space, and are not significantly Venetian.\"\r The overwhelming size of the angel compared to the Virgin and the brush strokes being more expressive shows the theme of incarnation. Titian\u2019s way of depicting the Virgin showing the flesh is more full in her bosom. Making the flesh of the virgin more evident, puts emphasis that Jesus was made from the Virgin's flesh.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Allegory of Time Governed by Prudence\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/allegory-of-time-governed-by-prudence\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Allegory of Prudence (c. 1565\u20131570) is an oil painting attributed to the Italian artist Titian and his assistants. It is in the National Gallery, London.\r The painting portrays three human heads, each facing in a different direction, above three animal heads, depicting (from left) a wolf, a lion and a dog. The painting is usually interpreted as operating on a number of levels. At the first level, the different ages of the three human heads represent the \"Three Ages of Man\" (youth, maturity, old age). The different directions in which they are facing reflect a second, wider concept of Time itself as having a past, present and future. This theme is repeated in the animal heads which, according to some traditions, are associated with those categories of time. The third level, from which the painting has acquired its present name, is suggested by a barely visible inscription, EX PRAETERITO/PRAESENS PRUDENTER AGIT/NE FUTURA ACTION\u1ebc DETURPET (\u201cFrom the experience of the past, the present acts prudently, lest it spoil future actions\u201d).\r It may also be that the human faces are actual portraits of the aged Titian, his son Orazio, and a young cousin, Marco Vecellio, who, like Orazio, lived and worked with Titian. Erwin Panofsky, in his classic exposition, suggests that the painting is specifically associated with the negotiations associated with the passing on of Titian\u2019s property to the younger generations, in the light of his approaching death. So, the painting acts as a visual counsel to the three generations to act prudently in the administration of the inheritance. But Nicholas Penny is highly sceptical of this, and points out discrepancies between the human heads and other evidence of the appearance of the individuals. He doubts it was a personal project of any sort and feels that is \"surely more likely that the painting was commissioned\".\r More recently the painting has been explained in quite different ways. Instead of an allegory of prudence, it has been seen as an allegory about sin and penitence. On this view, it amounts to an admission by Titian that his failure to act prudently in his youth and middle age has condemned him to lead a regretful old age.\r At the other extreme, the painting has been explained as asserting that the prudence which comes with experience and old age is an essential aspect of artistic discrimination and judgement. On this interpretation, the painting therefore acts as a rebuttal of the view that old age is the enemy of artistic achievement. On a more general level, the painting\u2019s depiction of Titian with his assistants Orazio and Marco is also intended as a defence of the prudence of the continuity of the Venetian workshop tradition.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Penitent St. Mary Magdalene\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/penitent-st-mary-magdalene\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Penitent Magdalene is a 1565 oil painting by Titian of saint Mary Magdalene, now in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.

Dating to about 1560, when Titian would have been over 70 years old, it is the later of his two surviving self-portraits. The painting is a realistic and unflattering depiction of the physical effects of old age, and as such shows none of the self-confidence of his earlier self-portrait (c. 1546\u201347) now in Berlin. That painting shows Titian in three-quarter view in an alert pose.\r Titian looks remote, aged and gaunt, staring into the middle distance, seemingly lost in thought. Yet the portrait projects dignity, authority and the mark of a master painter.\r Titian is dressed in simple but expensive clothes. In the lower left corner of the canvas he holds a paintbrush. Although the presence of the paintbrush is understated, it is the element that gives legitimacy to his implied status. Titian gave no indication as to his craft or profession in the Berlin portrait or any other earlier works; indeed this is one of the earliest self-portraits in western art in which the artist reveals himself as a painter. Titian's influence was such that the work led to numerous self-portraits by later generations of artists, including Vel\u00e1zquez and Goya, who in, respectively, Las Meninas (1656) and Charles IV of Spain and His Family (1800 - 1801) depicted themselves in the act of painting.\r The portrait is composed of deep shades of rich and distinguished black and brown, with small touches of white around his face and hair, and on his neckline and chain. Given the relatively flat pictorial plane, the viewer's attention is drawn to the sitter's sharp facial features: his high forehead, hooked nose, long beard and penetrating, deeply set eyes. Here, Titian's command of paint and shade marks a high point of his late period, and while the physical charisma seen in the Berlin picture has been diminished by age, it is now replaced with a sense of authority.\r Titian was keenly aware of how others perceived him, and sought to control his reputation by keeping to a minimum public knowledge of his life. Giorgio Vasari noted that by this stage in his life Titian had amassed enough wealth to not depend on commissioned work, or be beholden to any patron. His self-portrait was intended to enhance how he was viewed by others. It draws attention to both his advanced age and\u2014through his fine clothes and portrait in profile (a view then reserved for only the most noble)\u2014his status.\r Titian inserted a similar self-portrait in which he wore a skull cap in his The Virgin and Child with Saints Titian and Andrew, which he intended for his tomb in Pieve di Cadore.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Jacopo Strada\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/portrait-of-jacopo-strada-1568\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Jacopo Strada is a 1567-68 portrait of the court librarian Jacopo Strada by Titian, now held in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.\r Strada was not only an official book keeper, but also had many other qualities, and this portrait portrays him in his study surrounded by objects displaying his knowledge. He is shown wearing a gold chain, probably awarded him the previous year 1566 when he was appointed Antiquarius Caesareus by his employer Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor.\r The inscription upper right reads JACOBVUS DE STRADA CIVIS ROMANVS CAESS.

The painting is signed top left: \"TITIANVS F (ECIT)\". The letter on the table additionally contains the words Titian Vecellio Venezia.\r A century later this painting was documented in David Teniers the Younger's catalog Theatrum Pictorium of the art collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in 1659 and again in 1673, but the portrait had already enjoyed notoriety in Teniers' portrayals of the Archduke's art collection:\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Tarquin and Lucretia\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/tarquin-and-lucretia\n\nWikipedia Article:\nTarquin and Lucretia is an oil painting by Titian completed in 1571, when the artist was in his eighties, for Philip II of Spain. It is signed, and considered to have been finished entirely by Titian himself. It is one of a series of great works from Titian's last years, but unlike some of these, is fully finished. It is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England.\r The story from early Roman history (or legend) of the rape of Lucretia by Sextus Tarquinius (Tarquin), and her subsequent suicide, was a popular subject in Renaissance art. Tarquin raped Lucretia after threatening to kill her if she rejected his advances; this is the moment shown here. The next day she exposed him and committed suicide, prompting the Romans to revolt and overthrow Tarquin's father Tarquin the Proud, the last king of Rome, and establish the Roman Republic. This is traditionally dated to 509 BC. Violent subjects are characteristic of Titian's last years, mostly drawn from mythology or religion, but the directness of this composition stands out among them.\r The refinement of the poses of the figures is reflected in other contemporary versions of the painting. By this late stage in his career, Titian often took many years over paintings, setting them aside for long periods, only returning to them later. This painting is fully finished, and had been in progress for several years. As one of the latest documented and fully finished paintings by Titian, it is evidence for the much-debated question of whether other late Titians were ever finished or not.\r Most commonly, art depicted either the moment of the rape, or Lucretia is shown alone at the moment of her suicide. In this near life-size late version, which Titian said in a letter of 1568 (three years before it was completed) was \"an invention involving greater labour and artifice than anything, perhaps, that I have produced for many years\", the drama of the composition is heightened by small touches in pure white at the tip of the dagger and in Tarquin and Lucretia's eyes.\r The head and hand entering from the left belong to a male slave; in Livy's telling Tarquin said he would kill both Lucretia and the slave and claimed to have caught them during the act of adultery. The violent attack is closer to Ovid's account of the story, and although this is the only painting of a historical subject from Titian's last years, his mythological subjects are also all covered by Ovid. Lucretia wears her jewellery to bed, and Tarquin's clothes are modern and rich. Titian's signature is on the slipper at lower right. The painting has been trimmed on all sides, but it is not known when or by how much.\r The subject was one of a group showing women from legend or the Bible who were powerless, or only able to escape their situation through suicide, such as Susanna, Dido of Carthage and Verginia. These formed a counterpoint to, or sub-group of, the set of subjects known as the Power of Women, showing female violence against, or domination of, men. These were often depicted by the same artists, and especially popular in Northern Renaissance art. The story of Esther lay somewhere between these two extremes.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Death of Actaeon\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/death-of-actaeon-1562\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Death of Actaeon is a late work by the Italian Renaissance painter Titian, painted in oil on canvas from about 1559 to his death in 1576 and now in the National Gallery in London. It is very probably one of the two paintings the artist stated he had started and hopes to finish (one of which he calls \"Actaeon mauled by hounds\") in a letter to their commissioner Philip II of Spain during June 1559. However, most of Titian's work on this painting possibly dates to the late 1560s, but with touches from the 1570s. Titian seems never to have resolved it to his satisfaction, and the painting apparently remained in his studio until his death in 1576. There has been considerable debate as to whether it is finished or not, as with other very late Titians, such as the Flaying of Marsyas, which unlike this has a signature, perhaps an indication of completion.\r It is a sequel of Titian's work Diana and Actaeon showing the story's tragic conclusion, which approximately follows the Roman poet Ovid's account in the Metamorphoses: after Actaeon surprised the goddess Diana bathing naked in the woods, she transformed him into a stag and he was attacked and killed by his own hounds.\r Both paintings belong to a group of large-scale mythological paintings inspired by the Metamorphoses and referred to by Titian himself as \u2018poesie\u2019, the visual equivalent of poetry, which he began producing for Philip II of Spain in 1551 and which also include Dana\u00eb (many versions, Philip's in the Prado, Madrid), Venus and Adonis (private collection, London, but also other versions), Perseus and Andromeda (Wallace Collection, London), The Rape of Europa (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston), Diana and Actaeon and Diana and Callisto (shared by National Gallery of Scotland with NG London). However, as The Death of Actaeon was never delivered to Philip, it is not always counted in the series.\r Ovid's account does not include Diana herself pursuing Actaeon, or shooting at him, though in some other classical accounts she does chase him. She seems to have just loosed an arrow, but there is no sign of the arrow in the painting, nor is the bowstring visible. The goddess does not have her attribute of the small crescent in her hair that Titian's other two depictions in the poesie do, which troubled one early critic.\r There were ancient reliefs and engraved gems showing either Diana hunting with dogs, or Actaeon being attacked by his dogs, and a few Renaissance works, but the subject was rare, and \"it may be that Titian had never seen another painting or other representation of the subject.\"\r It was probably still in Titian's studio at his death in 1576, and presumably sold in Venice by his heirs. It probably belonged to the famous Venetian collection of Bartolomeo della Nave, most of which was bought for James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton (then still a Marquess) in 1636-38, one of the great collectors of the period in Britain. Hamilton's brother-in-law, Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh (as he later became) was English ambassador to Venice, and helped to arrange the purchase. A list of available paintings he sent Hamilton includes \"A Diana shooting Adonis in forme of a Hart not quite finished\" by Titian.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Crowning with Thorns\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/crowning-with-thorns\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Crowning with Thorns is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Titian (Tiziano Vecellio) done during 1542 and 1543. It is housed in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in Paris, France.\r The painting was commissioned by the confraternity of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. It was brought to France after the Napoleonic conquest of the city in 1797.\r In The Crowning with Thorns, painted for the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, the space is compressed in the scene by arranging the figures on a shallow plane delimited by the wall of a building. There are explicit references to antiquity: the figure of Christ derives from the celebrated Laocoon, an antique statue discovered in Rome in 1506, an archetypal exemplum doloris (\"example of pain\"). Another famous antique sculptural fragment, the Belvedere Torso, provides the model for the upper body of the torturer on the left. With the inclusion of the bust of Tiberius Caesar, a direct reference to the Roman authorities who condemned Christ, Titian also pays homage to the classical past.\r This is a brutal scene, in which Christ's tormentors twist the crown onto his head with their canes, but the violence is relieved and Christ's suffering exalted by the beauty of the colours, which especially in the blue and green to the right are colder than usual in deference to Titian's Roman sources. In Christ's foot extended on the steps, however, Titian pulls out all the Venetian stops and one can sense the blood flowing through the veins under the flesh. The pattern of the canes slices through the massed figures like the strokes of a knife, forming a Trinitarian triangle to the right of Christ's head. An inimitable Titian touch is the cane lying unused on the foremost step, still, shadowless and deadly, like a snake.\r According to Robert Haven Schauffler, the German painter Fritz von Uhde once considered it to be \"the greatest picture ever painted.\"\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Spain Succouring Religion\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/spain-succouring-religion\n\nWikipedia Article:\nReligion saved by Spain is an oil on canvas painting produced between 1572-1575 by the Italian master of the Venetian school, Titian (c. 1488/(1482) \u2013 1576) commemorating the Battle of Lepanto. It is a late work by Titian, and it is considered as an outstanding piece by Titian. It was purchased by the Prado Museum collection in 1839. Other titles are Spain succoring Religion or Religion succored by Spain.\r Spain rescues Religion depicts an allegory, mixing the allegory with political propaganda, portraying Spain as a woman in a dramatic landscape, with a shield in her right hand and a spear with the flag of Victory on it, while the Turkish threat is shown by a man wearing a turban in a chariot with two horses on the sea. On the shield there is the coat of arms of Felipe II (1556-1598). The person symbolizing the Christian Religion is depicted as a woman, to the right, falling on her knees, covered with a blue drapery, threatened by snakes.\r In the Battle of Lepanto the troops of the Holy League defeated Selim II (1524-1574). This Holy League was formed by an alliance of Spain, Venice and the Papal States. The battle stopped the expansion of the Ottoman Empire further in Europe.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: St Sebastian\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/st-sebastian\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Sebastian is a 1570-72 painting of Saint Sebastian by Titian, now in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.\n", "\nArtist: Titian\nArtwork Name: Pieta\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/pieta-1576\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Piet\u00e0 now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice is one of the last paintings by the Italian master Titian, and in its final, extended, state was left incomplete at his death in 1576, to be completed by Palma Giovane. Titian had intended it to hang over his grave, and the two stages of painting were to make it fit in two different churches.\r The picture is among Titian's last, one of several left unfinished at his death. An inscription in the lower part of the picture records that it was finished by Palma Giovane, whose interventions seem to have been kept to the minimum necessary, and doing his best to match Titian's own style. A minimalist view of the areas he worked on is that it \"was limited to the angel with the torch and to touching up the tympanum of the stone shrine\", but the female statue and Jerome's cloak have also been suspected of showing his hand, and he may have touched up the architecture more generally.\r The painting is one of a group in Titian's distinctive late style, which begins fully about 1570, though continuing trends seen in earlier works as far back as the mid-1550s. He often kept paintings in the studio for a long period, with several probably unfinished at his death in 1576. His brushwork becomes bold, but imprecise and impressionistic, and worked over many times, as recorded in a famous description by Palma Giovane. The distinction between forms and the space between them almost disappears, and \"The forms emerge like wraiths out of the circumambient darkness, and mass is reduced to a flickering pattern of colour and light. In his last years only these elements had reality for Titian.\"\r There is a long-running argument about which of the works of the 1570s have been completed, and by whom. In this case, the main group of the Piet\u00e0, in its first form, is known to have been delivered by Titian as finished, and the full expanded composition to have been finished by Palma Giovane. Other important paintings of the 1570s are Tarquin and Lucretia, which was delivered in 1571, the Saint Jerome delivered in 1575, and the Flaying of Marsyas, The Death of Actaeon, the Hermitage Museum's Saint Sebastian and the Crowning with Thorns in Munich, all of which were probably in his studio at his death.\r An original, much smaller, composition just showing the basic two figures of the standard Piet\u00e0 subject in Christian art, which consists of Virgin Mary cradling the dead body of Christ, was expanded after being completed and delivered (see below).\r Behind the central figures there is now a large rusticated Mannerist aedicule or niche, flanked by statues standing on plinths carved with giant lion heads. Along the top of the broken pediment six flaming lamps give a dull light, with another half-hidden in the centre, with vegetation around them, perhaps \"the figleaves of the Fall of Man\". A patch of dark sky can be seen at top left. Three massive keystone-like blocks in the centre drop below even the bottom of the pediment, a feature typical of the Mannerist architecture of Giulio Romano and his followers. These three blocks have been said to represent the Holy Trinity, or \"Christ as foundation of the faith\".\n", "\nArtist: Rosso Fiorentino\nArtwork Name: Deposition\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/rosso-fiorentino/deposition-1521\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Deposition from the Cross is an altarpiece, completed in 1521, depicting the Deposition of Christ by the Italian Renaissance painter Rosso Fiorentino. It is broadly considered to be the artist's masterpiece. Painted in oil on wood, the painting was previously located in the Duomo of Volterra, but has been moved to the town art gallery.\r This painting has often been compared to the fellow Mannerist painter Pontormo's near contemporary (1528) treatment of the same subject in his Deposition canvas in Florence.\r Unlike Pontormo's bright coloration and unitary collection of billowing figures, the Fiorentino depiction has two arenas: above is an Escher-like geometric struggle of laborers on ladders, mechanically removing the crucified Christ, while below, the women and men are subsumed in grief. Mary, pale and downcast, collapses in the arms of two women. Mary Magdalen in bright red, swoons to hug the Madonna's legs. A grief-stricken apostle turns his face away. The somber landscape is virtually barren. One reviewer describes the scene as \"violent suffering ...rendered by extreme expression, the concatenation of angular bodies, and the dazzling light that sharply draws clear folds on the clothing.\" Another states that this is the prototype of early-Mannerism, with \"no logical spatial connection between the figures, the cross and ladders; the size of the figures appears arbitrarily chosen, and their elongated bodies and small heads\" distort classical proportions.\r Rosso would go on to paint a second, darker and more crowded Deposition altarpiece for the church of San Lorenzo, Sansepolcro in Sansepolcro.\n", "\nArtist: Parmigianino\nArtwork Name: Amor Carving His Bow\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/parmigianino/amor-carving-his-bow-1524\n\nWikipedia Article:\nCupid Making His Bow (c. 1533\u20131535) is a painting by the Italian late Renaissance artist Parmigianino.

A more detailed description from 1670, of the works in the Palazzo del Giardino at Parma, also identifies the subject as religious man. The painting arrived in England in the early 19th century, in the collections of Lord Radstock, and was later auctioned at Christie's as Parmigianino's self-portrait. In 1857 it became part of the collections of Lord Strafford at Wrotham Park, being acquired by the National Gallery in 1977.\r It was published for the first time in an art history journal in 1940, on Emporium, which assigned it to the Roman sojounr of the painter. It was later considered earlier, to c. 1524, basing on stylistic similarities with works of that period. In particular, the bas-relief is similar to that in the fresco of Sts. Lucy and Apollonia at San Giovanni Evangelista, while the portrait scheme and technique recalls the Portrait of Galeazzo Sanvitale.\r There are at least two old copies of the painting, one in the Uffizi depot (inventory 3971) and one at the Walker Art Center of Minneapolis, United States.\r The first art historian to clarify that the subject was not a priest was Freedberg, in 1950, identifying him as Francesco Baiardi. Today he is considered an unknown collector, who holds the Offiziolo Durazzo, a miniated breviary today housed in the Biblioteca Civica Berio at Genoa.

It is now in the National Gallery, London, United Kingdom.\r The work was commissioned on 3 January 1526 in Rome, by Maria Bufalini, wife of Antonio Caccialupi, to decorate the family chapel in the church of San Salvatore in Lauro. The contract mentioned \"Francesco Mazola de Parma\" and one \"Pietro\" with the same name, perhaps Parmigianino's uncle Piero Ilario Mazzola. The elongated shape derives from its original destination as part of a triptych, whose sides (never painted) should represent the Immaculate Conception (to which the chapel was dedicated) and the saints Joachim and Anna.\r According to late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari, Parmigianino was working to this painting during the Sack of Rome, and he had to stop when the city was ravaged by the imperial troops. He was able to escape paying a ransom, while his uncle remained in Rome, being able to hide the painting in the refectory of Santa Maria della Pace.\r In 1558 the Bufalini family decided to move it in their chapel in Sant'Agostino at Citt\u00e0 di Castello, from where it was acquired in 1790 by the English painter James Durno. In England, it was sold to the Marquess of Albercon for 1,500 guineas, then, after a series of changes of hand, to the National Gallery, in 1826.\r There are preparatory drawings in the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9, the British Museum and other museums, for a total of some twenty.

It is housed in the National Museum of Capodimonte, Naples, Italy.\r Parmigianino worked for a short period at the Sanvitale family court in their \"Rocca\" (palace-fortress) at Fontanellato (in what is now the province of Parma). The work, dated 1524 on the rear, was executed during his stay there, before he moved to Rome the following year. He also executed the Stufetta of Diana and Actaeon and a cycle of frescoes in the private room of Paola Gonzaga, wife of Gian Galeazzo Sanvitale. The work was part of the Farnese collections in 1587, when it is mentioned for the first time in an inventory. The work had been perhaps acquired by duke Ottavio Farnese in 1561 when he acquired from bishop Eucherio Sanvitale the casino (mansion) of Codiponte, in the Ducal Park of Parma. Eucherio was the son of Gian Galeazzo Sanvitale, and had inherited the family's possessions in 1550.\r The portrait, together with the whole Farnese collection, left Parma for Naples in 1784. The French removed it in 1799, and it was later at Palermo until 1816, before returning to Naples. During the various changes of hands the painting lost its original identification, and was considered a portrait of Christopher Columbus (likely due to the presence, in the hat, of a representation of the Pillars of Hercules) from Raphael's school. A descendant of Galeazzo Sanvitale, Luigi, recognized his ancestor based on some documents, in 1857. The re-attribution to Parmigianino occurred in 1894.\r There are some preparatory drawings at the Cabinet des Dessins of the Louvre (6472 recto and verso) and in the Tobley Collection.\r The work is a \"parade portrait\", destined to enhance the count's image in front of his guests, and not a private depiction: this is visible in the rich display of objects showing his interests and his refined costumes.\r The count, then 28, is portrayed on a \"Savonarola\" chair from three-quarters but with the face looking towards the viewer. He wears a wide black jacket, according to the contemporary alla Francese (\"French-style\") fashion, under which two red sleeves and the white shirt (with embroideries at the wrist) are visible. The elegant beret is in the same scarlet as the sleeves, and sports gilt pearls, a plum and a decorative cameo. The French style of the clothes is an allusion to the political allegiance of the Sanvitale at the time.\r The left hand lies on the chair's armrest: it has a golden ring with a stone at the little finger, and holds a glove, near the sword's hilt. The other hand is wearing a glove, and shows a bronze medal with two symbols. These symbols have been interpreted as a \"C\" and an \"F\", hinting to title of Comes Fontanellati (\"Count of Fontanellato\"), or as a \"72\" (based on earlier inventories). The meaning of the number is subject to several speculations. It has been connected to alchemy, an allusion to the Moon and Jupiter or to the conjunction of the Sun and Moon, referring in turn to the marriage of Galeazzo and his wife Paola Gonzaga. There is no historical record that Sanvitale practiced alchemy: although Parmigiano likely did, art historians have found no reason he should insert coded elements into a portrait.\n", "\nArtist: Parmigianino\nArtwork Name: A Turkish Slave\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil,panel\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/parmigianino/a-turkish-slave\n\nWikipedia Article:\nTurkish Slave (Portrait of a Young Woman; Italian: Schiava turca) is a painting by the Italian Mannerist artist Parmigianino, executed around 1533.

It is in fact a typical headdress of noblewomen of the time called a balzo, with examples appearing in numerous contemporary portraits. She is wearing a chemise under her elaborately sleeved dress called a guimp and is holding a feather fan used as a flywhisk.\r The work was in the Uffizi Gallery until 1928, when it was exchanged for two 13th century panels and a portrait thought to be of Philip, Duke of Parma by Giuseppe Baldrighi and later recognized as a self-portrait. It had arrived in Florence through Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici, who owned it as early as 1675 and left it to the Medici Cabinet after his death.

She wears a white silk dress or bodice striped with gold. Her over-dress of indigo blue satin has large puffed sleeves and is worn low around the shoulders, revealing the bodice. She also wears a soft embroidered apron on her belly of a type also represented in the painting Antea by the same artist. On the head she wears a doughnut-shaped headdress sewn with gilt thread and decorated by a medallion portraying Pegasus, perhaps a metaphor of love or a heraldic reference to the Cavalli family. This style of headwear was fashionable for women of the time, invented for Isabella d'Este and featured in numerous female portraits from the Lombard and Padan area in the early 16th century.\r On the hand, whose slender fingers are typical of Parmigianino art, she wears a small ring, perhaps a reference to a recent marriage. She holds a plume used to fan herself, depicted with highly detailed brushstrokes.\r The proposed identifications of the woman include Giulia Gonzaga at the time of her marriage to Vespasiano Gonzaga.\n", "\nArtist: Parmigianino\nArtwork Name: Camilla Gonzaga with Her Three Sons\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/parmigianino/camilla-gonzaga-with-her-three-sons\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Camilla Gonzaga and Her Three Sons is a painting attributed to the Italian Mannerist artist Parmigianino and others, executed around 1539-1540 and housed in the Museo del Prado, Madrid, Spain. It forms a pair with another painting in the Prado, the Portrait of Pier Maria Rossi di San Secondo, Camilla's husband, a painting which is unanimously assigned to Parmigianino.\r It is mentioned in a 1686 inventory of the collections of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid, as the wife of the count of San Sigundo. The subject has been identified with Camilla Gonzaga, wife of imperial general Pier Maria III de' Rossi basing on this note, and by another from 1630 by one of his descendants about the existence of a portrait of him by Parmigianino.\r The painting arrived in Spain in 1664, after King Philip IV had supported to the Rossi family in a dispute with the Farnese of Parma about some territories. It has been dated from around 1539-1540, but the attribution to Parmigianino is controversial, the author having been identified also as an artist from Bronzino's workshop. It is possible that Parmigianino, who died in 1540, had not been able to finish the portrait, which was completed by another artist, perhaps basing on his sketch.\r The countess is portrayed on a black background, wearing a precious scarlet dress, a frilled mousseline on the chest, and rich set of jewels. She looks to the right, ideally towards the portrait of her husband. The countess is surrounded by her three sons, Troilo, Federico and Ippolito. It is the first case in Italian art in which this iconography was used.\r The three sons appear to be from different hands, and were perhaps added in different moments.\n", "\nArtist: Parmigianino\nArtwork Name: Madonna with the Long Neck\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/parmigianino/madonna-with-the-long-neck-1540\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna with the Long Neck (Italian: Madonna dal collo lungo), also known as Madonna and Child with Angels and St. Jerome, is an Italian Mannerist oil painting by the painter Parmigianino, dating from c. 1535-1540 and depicting Madonna and Child with angels. The painting was begun in 1534 for the funerary chapel of Francesco Tagliaferri in Parma, but remained incomplete on Parmigianino's death in 1540. Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany purchased it in 1698 and it has been on display at the Uffizi since 1948.\r The painting depicts the Virgin Mary seated on a high pedestal in luxurious robes, holding a rather large baby Jesus on her lap. Six angels crowded together on the Madonna's right, adore the Christ-child.\r In the lower right-hand corner of the painting is an enigmatic scene, with a row of marble columns and the emaciated figure of St. Jerome. A depiction of St. Jerome was required by the commissioner because of the saint's connection with the adoration of the Virgin Mary.\r The painting is popularly called Madonna of the Long Neck because \"the painter, in his eagerness to make the Holy Virgin look graceful and elegant, has given her a neck like that of a swan.\" On the unusual arrangement of figures, Austrian-British art historian E. H. Gombrich writes:\r Parmigianino has distorted nature for his own artistic purposes, creating a typical Mannerist figura serpentinata. Jesus is also extremely large for a baby, and he lies precariously on Mary's lap as if about to fall at any moment. The Madonna herself is of hardly human proportions\u2014she is almost twice the size of the angels to her right. Her right foot rests on cushions that appear to be only a few inches away from the picture plane, but the foot itself seems to project beyond it, and is thus on \"our\" side of the canvas, breaking the conventions of a framed picture. Her slender hands and long fingers have also led the Italian medical scientist Vito Franco of the University of Palermo to diagnose that Parmigianino's model had the genetic disorder Marfan syndrome affecting her connective tissue.\r Following a recent restoration of the painting, the unfinished face of an angel just below the Madonna's right elbow can be seen more clearly. Also the angel in the middle of the bottom row now looks at the vase held by the angel on his right, in which can be seen the faint image of a cross. Before the restoration this angel looked down at the Christ child. The changes made during the restoration likely reflect the original painting, which must have been altered at some time in its history. The angel who faces the viewer has a resemblance to Parmigianino's Antea portrait.\n", "\nArtist: Andrea Palladio\nArtwork Name: Palazzo Antonini, Udine\nArtwork Genre: architecture\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-palladio/palazzo-antonini-udine-1550\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPalazzo Antonini is a palazzo in Udine, northern Italy, designed by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio in the middle of the 16th century for the Antonini family, owner of various other palaces in Udine.  The present owner is the Bank of Italy.  The beginning of construction on the Palazzo Antonini is traditionally said to date to 1556, contemporaneous with the construction of the Bollani arch, another work by Palladio in Udine. The patron was Floriano Antonini, a young and ambitious member of one of the most high-profile families of Udine aristocracy. Antonini did not hesitate to resurrect erudite traditions by minting a foundation medal for the Palazzo, probably desiring to demonstrate that sophisticated taste was not the exclusive prerogative of aristocratic circles in the capital of the Serenissima, Venice. In 1559, the palace was already partially inhabitable, but in 1563 building works were still in progress.  In the following century, at least two campaigns of works heavily altered the building\u2019s appearance, going so far as to replace all the windows, except those to the right of the loggia on the back fa\u00e7ade, as well as the internal staircases. In 1709, Martino Fischer executed the decorative ornaments, thereby contributing to the definitive transformation of the original Palladian interiors. In essence, all that remains of Palladio\u2019s project are the plan (less the stairs) and the building\u2019s basic volumes, the front and back loggias (whose pediments were never executed), and the components of the \"Hall of the four columns\".  This project opens the section in the I quattro libri dell'architettura (1570) dedicated to city palaces although, as was the opposite case in the Villa Pisani at Montagnana and the Villa Cornaro at Piombino, the Palazzo Antonini was actually a rather ambivalent building: it is truly an urban palace which assumes the typology of a suburban villa. In this respect, one must bear in mind that the palace rose on the borders of the urban centre, in an open area with gardens, just like the Palazzo Chiericati or the Palazzo Civena.  The design of its fa\u00e7ades facing the street incorporates engaged Ionic half-columns, fashioned from blocks of stone, which forecast those at the Villa Sarego at Santa Sofia. A thick web of openings transforms the loggia onto the street into a sort of diaphragm transparent to the light. The entire edifice seems to be strapped by continuous bands of stone, from the plinth of engaged columns to the entablature, right up to the band corresponding to the upper frieze, where the small unframed windows of the granary open.

The palace we see today was created from two buildings separated by the alley known as Do Rode (Due Ruote), probably in 1566, following upon a request by Vincenzo Pojana to the town of Vicenza in 1561.  The attribution to Palladio is founded neither on documentary evidence nor on autograph drawings, but rather on the evidence of the architectural quality of the articulation of the piano nobile, with its order which embraces two whole floors, not to mention the design of various details, like the very elegant and fleshy Composite capitals and the entablature.  However, elements such as the pilasters devoid of entasis (that is, the characteristic swelling which culminates at a third of the shaft\u2019s height) conform so little with Palladio\u2019s vocabulary in the 1560s, that one may hypothesize that the design of the left-hand portion of the palace was the product of a youthful project by Palladio, only later extended to include the neighbouring building during the 1560s, when Pojana decided to enlarge his own residence. This would also explain the differences in the configuration of the basement zone between the two halves of the building.\n", "\nArtist: Giuseppe Arcimboldo\nArtwork Name: The Lawyer\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/giuseppe-arcimboldo/the-lawyer-1566\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Jurist (Italian: L'Avvocato), also known as The Lawyer, is an oil-on-canvas painting by Italian artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo, painted in 1566.\r It shows a member of the legal profession, whose facial features are depicted using meat and fish, and whose body is composed of legal documents. Two versions of the painting exist; the first, from 1566, is held by the National Museum of Fine Arts (Nationalmuseum) in Stockholm (acquired from a collection at Gripsholm Castle in 1866), and a later version is held by a private collector in Milan.\r Arcimboldo was employed as court painter to Maximilian II and was already well established as an artist by the time he created The Jurist. He was known for his innovative style, particularly for his portraits in which the subjects were composed of everyday objects. His fantastical and imaginative paintings somewhat foreshadowed the Surrealist movement of the 20th century, but were also appreciated as part of the Mannerist tradition of his own time. His series of paintings, The Four Seasons, which depicted the changing seasons as series of portraits composed of seasonal plants, were particularly popular, and he even created a portrait of Rudolf II (entitled Vertemnus) in the same style.\r The features of the face are represented by the plucked carcasses of poultry and the sneering mouth by fish. It is not known if the subject is a caricature of the legal profession in general or based on a real jurist of the time. The German jurist Ulrich Zasius is normally suggested as the subject; the Nationalmuseum lists the picture in its catalogue as The Lawyer (Ulrich Zasius), but Calvin has also been suggested. Arcimboldo's portrait of The Librarian (Il Bibliotecario), painted the same year, has a more noble aspect, although this portrait too has been interpreted as a parody of librarianship, book collectors, and intellectualism.\n", "\nArtist: Giuseppe Arcimboldo\nArtwork Name: The Librarian\nArtwork Genre: allegorical painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/giuseppe-arcimboldo/the-librarian\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Librarian is an oil on canvas painting by Giuseppe Arcimboldo in the collection of Skokloster Castle in Sweden. It is thought to be a portrait of Wolfgang Lazius, a humanist and historian who served Holy Roman Emperors of the House of Habsburg.\r Arcimboldo became official portraitist to Emperor Ferdinand I in 1562 and later to Maximilian II and Rudolf II. The Librarian is one of a series of paintings by Arcimboldo of members of Maximilian's entourage. Skokloster Castle dates the painting to 1562, though the painting is more often dated circa 1566.\r Arcimboldo created a number of portraits of people by painting an assemblage of objects such as fruits and vegetables, flowers, or in this case, books; the objects typically had some connection to the person's life or depiction. Benno Geiger called it a \"triumph of abstract art in the 16th century\". In 1957, art historian Sven Alfons was the first to conclude that this was specifically a portrait of Lazius. The work has been interpreted as both a celebration and a satirical mocking of librarians and scholarship. K. C. Elhard suggests that it may be specifically a parody of \"materialistic book collectors more interested in acquiring books than in reading them.\"\r Elhard notes that The Librarian has become \"a fixture in the visual history of the library profession\". However, the original title, if any, is unknown, and its current title first appears (in Swedish as \"Bibliotekarien\") in an early 20th-century inventory.\r The Librarian is one of two works by Arcimbolodo in the collection of Skokloster Castle. The painting was brought to Sweden following the looting of Prague Castle by the Swedish army during the 1648 Battle of Prague and was owned by General Hans Christoff von K\u00f6nigsmarck.\r There are three other extant versions of the painting whose attributions are uncertain. A scientific study published in 2011 concluded that The Librarian was a later copy of Arcimbolodo's original painting, whose whereabouts are unknown.\n", "\nArtist: Paolo Veronese\nArtwork Name: Venus and Adonis\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese/venus-and-adonis\n\nWikipedia Article:\nVenus and Adonis is a 1562 painting by Paolo Veronese, now held at the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen in Augsburg, Germany.\r It shows the moment at which Venus tries to stop Adonis from going hunting after having a premonition of his death. He had painted another version of the same subject in 1580, but the style and composition of the two works are completely different. According to some critics, Veronese based the 1562 version on Titian's painting of the subject, which he first encountered through engravings by Cornelis Cort. Veronese puts Venus's shoulders in the same position and the general approach is similar to Titian's, though Veronese's work is less dramatic and more composed, with the characters' relationship based more on looks than physical contact and with Venus stopping Adonis by holding onto his dogs' leads and hiding his hunting horn.\n", "\nArtist: Paolo Veronese\nArtwork Name: The Wedding Feast at Cana\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese/the-marriage-at-cana-1563\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Wedding Feast at Cana (1563), by the Italian artist Paolo Veronese (1528\u201388), is a representational painting that depicts the biblical story of the Marriage at Cana, at which Jesus converts water to wine (John 2:1\u201311). Executed in the Mannerist style (1520\u20131600) of the late Renaissance, the large-format (6.77m \u00d7 9.94m) oil painting comprehends the stylistic ideal of compositional harmony, as practised by the artists Leonardo, Raphael, and Michelangelo.\r The art of the High Renaissance (1490\u20131527) emphasized human figures of ideal proportions, balanced composition, and beauty, whereas Mannerism exaggerated the Renaissance ideals \u2014 of figure, light, and colour \u2014 with asymmetric and unnaturally elegant arrangements achieved by flattening the pictorial space and distorting the human figure as an ideal preconception of the subject, rather than as a realistic representation.\r The visual tension among the elements of the picture and the thematic instability among the human figures in The Wedding Feast at Cana derive from Veronese's application of technical artifice, the inclusion of sophisticated cultural codes and symbolism (social, religious, theologic), which present a biblical story relevant to the Renaissance viewer and to the contemporary viewer. The pictorial area (67.29 m) of the canvas makes The Wedding Feast at Cana the most expansive picture in the paintings collection of the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre.\r At Venice, on 6 June 1562, the Black Monks of the Order of Saint Benedict (OSB) commissioned the painter Paolo Veronese to realise a monumental painting (6.77m\u00d79.94m) to decorate the far wall of the monastery's new refectory, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio, at the Basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore, on the eponymous island. In their business contract for the commission of The Wedding Feast at Cana, the Benedictine monks stipulated that Veronese be paid 324 ducats; be paid the costs of his personal and domestic maintenance; be provided a barrel of wine; and be fed in the refectory. \r Aesthetically, the Benedictine contract stipulated that the painter represent \u201cthe history of the banquet of Christ\u2019s miracle at Cana, in Galilee, creating the number of [human] figures that can be fully accommodated.\u201d That Veronese use optimi colori (optimum colours) \u2014 specifically, the colour ultramarine, a deep-blue pigment made from lapis lazuli, a semi-precious, metamorphic rock. Assisted by his brother, Benedetto Caliari, Veronese delivered the completed painting in September 1563, in time for the Festa della Madonna della Salute, in November.\r In the 17th century, during the mid\u20131630s, supporters of Andrea Sacchi (1599\u20131661) and supporters of Pietro da Cortona (1596\u20131669) argued much about the ideal number of human figures for a representational composition. Sacchi said that only a few figures (fewer than twelve) permit the artist to honestly depict the unique body poses and facial expressions that communicate character; while da Cortona said that many human figures consolidate the general image of a painting into an epic subject from which sub-themes would develop.\r In the 18th century, in Seven Discourses on Art (1769\u201390), the portraitist Joshua Reynolds (1723\u201392), said that:\r As a narrative painting in the Mannerist style, The Wedding Feast at Cana combines stylistic and pictorial elements from the Venetian school's philosophy of colorito (priority of colour) of Titian (1488\u20131576) to the compositional disegno (drawing) of the High Renaissance (1490\u20131527) used in the works of Leonardo (1452\u20131519), Raphael (1483\u20131520), and Michelangelo (1475\u20131564). As such, Veronese's depiction of the crowded banquet-scene that is The Wedding Feast at Cana is meant to be viewed upwards, from below \u2014 because the painting's bottom-edge was 2.50 metres from the refectory floor, behind and above the head-table seat of the abbot of the monastery.\n", "\nArtist: Paolo Veronese\nArtwork Name: The Family of Darius before Alexander\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese/the-family-of-darius-before-alexander\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Family of Darius before Alexander is a 1565\u20131570 oil on canvas painting by Paolo Veronese. It depicts Alexander the Great with the family of Darius III, the Persian king he had defeated in battle. Although Veronese had previously painted a version of the subject, since destroyed, the theme had rarely been depicted by other artists before him. The painting has been in the collection of the National Gallery in London since 1857.\r In 333 BC Alexander defeated Darius III, the last king of the Achaemenid Empire, at the Battle of Issus. Darius escaped capture, but his wife Stateira I, his mother, Sisygambis, and his daughters Stateira II and Drypetis were taken by Alexander. Alexander displayed forgiveness in victory. According to Plutarch:\r \"[He] gave them leave to bury whom they pleased of the Persians, and to make use for this purpose what garments and furniture they thought fit out of the booty. He diminished nothing of their equipage, or of the attentions and respect formerly paid them, and allowed larger pensions for their maintenance than they had before. But the noblest and most royal part of their usage was, that he treated these illustrious prisoners according to their virtue and character.\"\r Although Darius's wife was renowned for her beauty, \"Alexander, esteeming it more kingly to govern himself than to conquer his enemies, sought no intimacy with any of them.\" The painting focuses on a misunderstanding involving Sisygambis, Darius's mother, which was not mentioned by Plutarch, but was recounted by several late Classical writers, among them Arrian, Valerius Maximus and Quintus Curtius Rufus. According to Quintus Curtius's History of Alexander the Great, Alexander went to the women's tent accompanied only by Hephaestion, counselor to the king and his intimate friend since the two had been children. Sisygambis mistook the taller Hephaestion for Alexander, and knelt before him to plead for mercy. When her error was realized, Alexander magnanimously said that Hephaestion, too, was Alexander; this assuaged Sisygambis's embarrassment over her confusion, and served as a compliment to his friend.\r The composition preserves this ambiguity, and reflects the confusion of Sisygambis. Generally the scholarship is in agreement that Alexander is the young man in red, who gestures as if in the act of speaking while referring to Hephaestion at his left, though some historians dispute that interpretation and reverse the two figures' identities. The continued uncertainty as to their correct identification is taken as evidence of Veronese's \"pictorial intelligence.\"\r While honoring the spirit of the story, Veronese took liberties with his interpretation of the narrative, which in the painting occurs in a palatial hall, not a tent. The splendid wardrobe is that of the Venice in which Veronese lived, rather than ancient Greece or the Far East. It has long been supposed that Veronese inserted portraits of his contemporaries into the painting, as was customary in Venetian history painting. While it has been suggested that the figures were modeled after members of the Pisani family, for whose estate the picture was made, it has alternatively been proposed that the kneeling girls are Veronese's daughters, and the courtier who presents them is the artist's self-portrait. Another interpretation has Veronese appearing in the form of the man standing behind Alexander, while it has been suggested that it is the patron Francesco Pisani who presents the family to Alexander. Recently art historian Nicholas Penny has written that the painting's characterizations of cultivated nobility were based on no particular models, and were products of the artist's imagination.\n", "\nArtist: Paolo Veronese\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Daniele Barbaro\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese/portrait-of-daniele-barbaro-1570\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of a gentleman in a fur is an oil painting by Paolo Veronese, datable to around 1550-1560 and now in the Galleria Palatina in Florence.

The Holy League was a coalition of European Catholic maritime states arranged by Pope Pius V and led by Adm. John of Austria, as agreed between Philip II of Spain\u2014who largely financed the League\u2014and the Venetian Republic (main contributor of ships), as well as the Portuguese Empire since it was the primary naval power in the century, being the first modern Global Empire. The Portuguese were also experienced in fighting the Ottoman Empire (and its allies) in the Indian Ocean as early as the century began, finally defeating it in The Ottoman-Portuguese War. To this battle, Portugal provided ships, menpower and cutting-edge naval technology..\r In the history of naval warfare, Lepanto marks the last major engagement in the Western world to be fought entirely, or almost entirely, between rowing vessels, the galleys and galeasses that were still the direct descendants of the ancient trireme warships. The battle was in essence an \"infantry battle on floating platforms\". It was the largest naval battle in Western history since classical antiquity, involving more than 400 warships. Over the following decades, the increasing importance of the galleon and the line of battle tactic would displace the galley as the major warship of its era, marking the beginning of the \"Age of Sail\".\r The victory of the Holy League is of great importance in the history of Europe and of the Ottoman Empire, marking the turning-point of Ottoman military expansion into the Mediterranean, although the Ottoman wars in Europe would continue for another century. It has long been compared to the Battle of Salamis, both for tactical parallels and for its crucial importance in the defense of Europe against imperial expansion. It was also of great symbolic importance in a period when Europe was torn by its own wars of religion following the Protestant Reformation, strengthening the position of Philip II of Spain as the \"Most Catholic King\" and defender of Christendom against Muslim incursion, although this was mitigated by the defeat of the Spanish Armada by the Royal Navy of England in 1588.\r The Christian coalition had been promoted by Pope Pius V to rescue the Venetian colony of Famagusta on the island of Cyprus, which was being besieged by the Turks in early 1571 subsequent to the fall of Nicosia and other Venetian possessions in Cyprus in the course of 1570. On 1 August the Venetians had surrendered after being reassured that they could leave Cyprus freely. However, the Ottoman commander, Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha, who had lost some 50,000 men in the siege, broke his word, imprisoning the Venetians. On 17 August Marco Antonio Bragadin was flayed alive and his corpse hung on Mustafa's galley together with the heads of the Venetian commanders, Astorre Baglioni, Alvise Martinengo and Gianantonio Querini.\n", "\nArtist: Paolo Veronese\nArtwork Name: Feast in the House of Levi (Last Supper)\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese/feast-in-the-house-of-levi-1573\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Feast in the House of Levi or Christ in the House of Levi is a 1573 painting by Italian painter Paolo Veronese and one of the largest canvases of the 16th century, measuring 555\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a01,280\u00a0cm (18.21\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a041.99\u00a0ft). It is now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice. It was painted by Veronese for the rear wall of the refectory of the Basilica di Santi Giovanni e Paolo, a Dominican friary, as a Last Supper, to replace an earlier work by Titian destroyed in the fire of 1571.\r However, the painting led to an investigation by the Roman Catholic Inquisition. Veronese was called to answer for irreverence and indecorum, and the serious offence of heresy was mentioned. He was asked to explain why the painting contained \"buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs and other such scurrilities\" as well as extravagant costumes and settings, in what is indeed a fantasy version of a Venetian patrician feast. Veronese was told that he must change his painting within a three-month period; instead, he simply changed the title to The Feast in the House of Levi, still an episode from the Gospels, but less doctrinally central, and one in which the Gospels specified \"sinners\" as present. After this, no more was said.\r The painting depicts a banquet scene in which the tall figure of Christ is depicted in the centre dressed in a shimmering pale green robe while the surrounding people interact in a turbulence of polychromatic splendour in a diverse range of different positions and poses. The feast is framed by the great pillars and archways of a portico and a staircase to the right.\r The revised title refers to an episode in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 5, in which Jesus is invited to a banquet:\r In Venice, a court of the Inquisition interrogated Veronese about the thematic and theologic content of The Feast in the House of Levi (1573), then called a Last Supper:\r \u201cThis day, July eighteenth, 1573.

I fancy that it concerns what was said to me by the reverend fathers, or rather by the prior of the monastery of San Giovanni e Paolo, whose name I did not know, but who informed me that he had been here, and that your Most Illustrious Lordships had ordered him to cause to be placed in the picture a Magdalen instead of the dog; and I answered him that very readily I would do all that was needful for my reputation and for the honor of the picture; but that I did not understand what this figure of the Magdalen could be doing here; and this for many reasons, which I will tell, when occasion is granted me to speak.Q. What is the picture to which you have been referring?A. It is the picture which represents the Last Supper of Jesus Christ with His disciples in the house of Simon.Q. Where is this picture?A. In the refectory of the monks of San Giovanni e Paolo.Q. Is it painted in fresco or on wood or on canvas?A. It is on canvas.Q. How many feet does it measure in height?A. It may measure seventeen feet.Q. And in breadth?A. About thirty-nine.Q. How many have you represented? And what is each one doing?A. First there is the innkeeper, Simon; then, under him, a carving squire whom I supposed to have come there for his pleasure, to see how the service of the table is managed. There are many other figures which I cannot remember, however, as it is a long time since I painted that picture.Q. Have you painted other Last Suppers besides that one?A. Yes.Q. How many have you painted? Where are they?A. I painted one at Verona for the reverend monks of San Lazzaro; it is in their refectory. Another is in the refectory of the reverend brothers of San Giorgio here in Venice.Q. But that one is not a Last Supper, and is not even called the Supper of Our Lord.A. I painted another in the refectory of San Sebastiano in Venice, another at Padua for the Fathers of the Maddalena. I do not remember to have made any others.Q. In this Supper which you painted for San Giovanni e Paolo, what signifies the figure of him whose nose is bleeding?A. He is a servant who has a nose-bleed from some accident.Q. What signify those armed men dressed in the fashion of Germany, with halberds in their hands?A. It is necessary here that I should say a score of words.Q. Say them.A. We painters use the same license as poets and madmen, and I represented those halberdiers, the one drinking, the other eating at the foot of the stairs, but both ready to do their duty, because it seemed to me suitable and possible that the master of the house, who as I have been told was rich and magnificent, would have such servants.Q. And the one who is dressed as a jester with a parrot on his wrist, why did you put him into the picture?A. He is there as an ornament, as it is usual to insert such figures.Q. Who are the persons at the table of Our Lord?A. The twelve apostles.Q. What is Saint Peter doing, who is the first?A. He is carving the lamb in order to pass it to the other part of the table.Q. What is he doing who comes next?A. He holds a plate to see what Saint Peter will give him.Q. Tell us what the third is doing.A. He is picking his teeth with a fork.Q. And who are really the persons whom you admit to have been present at this Supper?A. I believe that there was only Christ and His Apostles; but when I have some space left over in a picture I adorn it with figures of my own invention.Q. Did some person order you to paint Germans, buffoons, and other similar figures in this picture?A. No, but I was commissioned to adorn it as I thought proper; now it is very large and can contain many figures.Q. Should not the ornaments which you were accustomed to paint in pictures be suitable and in direct relation to the subject, or are they left to your fancy, quite without discretion or reason?A. I paint my pictures with all the considerations which are natural to my intelligence, and according as my intelligence understands them.Q. Does it seem suitable to you, in the Last Supper of our Lord, to represent buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs, and other such absurdities?A. Certainly not.Q. Then why have you done it?A. I did it on the supposition that those people were outside the room in which the Supper was taking place.Q. Do you not know that in Germany and other countries infested by heresy, it is habitual, by means of pictures full of absurdities, to vilify and turn to ridicule the things of the Holy Catholic Church, in order to teach false doctrine to ignorant people who have no common sense?A. I agree that it is wrong, but I repeat what I have said, that it is my duty to follow the examples given me by my masters.Q. Well, what did your masters paint? Things of this kind, perhaps?A. In Rome, in the Pope's Chapel, Michelangelo has represented Our Lord, His Mother, St. John, St. Peter, and the celestial court; and he has represented all these personages nude, including the Virgin Mary [this last incorrect], and in various attitudes not inspired by the most profound religious feeling.Q. Do you not understand that in representing the Last Judgment, in which it is a mistake to suppose that clothes are worn, there was no reason for painting any? But in these figures what is there that is not inspired by the Holy Spirit? There are neither buffoons, dogs, weapons, nor other absurdities. Do you think, therefore, according to this or that view, that you did well in so painting your picture, and will you try to prove that it is a good and decent thing?A. No, my most Illustrious Sirs; I do not pretend to prove it, but I had not thought that I was doing wrong; I had never taken so many things into consideration. I had been far from imaging such a great disorder, all the more as I had placed these buffoons outside the room in which Our Lord was sitting.\n", "\nArtist: Paolo Veronese\nArtwork Name: Bathsheba Bathing\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese/bathsheba-bathing\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBathsheba at her Bath is a painting by Italian Renaissance painter Paolo Veronese, dated around 1575 and now in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon, France.\r This work is a marriage painting by Veronese ordered by a Venetian customer dealing with the theme of adultery linked to that of Justice and shows eroticism between the main two characters. The painting arrived in France in the seventeenth century in the royal collections. It was then kept at the Palace of Versailles, enlarged atop and on the left side to match the woodwork. It was sent to Lyon by the State in 1811, and is currently exhibited at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon. Its original format was restored in 1991, keeping the extension behind the new guidelines.\r The painting depicts a biblical scene: Bathsheba when she is seen by King David from the terrace of his palace while she bathes in the evening. But uncertainty about the subject represented. However, although it is generally agreed that the subject of the painting is Bathsheba at her bath, the scene could represent another biblical story, namely Susannah and the Elders, in which a very beautiful woman, who bathes on a hot day and is watched by two old men (who are the characters in the arcades in the background) who unsuccessfully tried to have a sexual intercourse with her and eventually unjustly accused her of adultery.\r In this painting, one of his many masterpieces, Veronese vertically divided the space into two separate parts, yet linked by agreements in the colors and a powerful chiaroscuro. The old man wears the cloak of gold buttons which is characteristic of the Doges of Venice. The arms represented on the pitcher may reflect the celebration of a marriage or an alliance between two powerful Venetian families.\r According to art historians Daniel Arasse and Jos\u00e9phine Le Foll, two themes are intertwined in this painting:\n", "\nArtist: Paolo Veronese\nArtwork Name: Lucretia\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese/lucretia\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLucretia is a painting by Paolo Veronese from c. 1585.\n", "\nArtist: Paolo Veronese\nArtwork Name: Venus and Adonis\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese/venus-and-adonis-1582\n\nWikipedia Article:\nVenus and Adonis is a painting by the Italian late Mannerist artist Paolo Veronese, executed in 1580, now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.\r The original painting was enlarged in the upper border in the 18th century.

The large size of the Christ Church painting is exceptional for such a subject at this date, and it has been suggested they were commissioned by a butcher's guild, or for use as a sign. Carracci was influenced in his depiction of everyday life subjects by Vincenzo Campi and Bartolomeo Passarotti, whom the Butcher's Shop was originally attributed to. Carracci's ability to adapt his style is demonstrated, making it \"lower\" when concerning \"lower\", quasi-satirical subjects like the Mangiafagioli and the Butcher's Shop, while in his more academic works (such as the roughly contemporary Assumption of the Virgin) he was able to use a more finished manner with the same ease.\r It is claimed that members of the painter's family were used as models. Significant alterations to some figures are revealed by X-rays, and the hand on the edge of the table, now apparently belonging to the old woman, though not in proportion with the rest of her, may have originally belonged to the butcher to the right of her.\r The Christ Church painting was in the collections of the Gonzaga Dukes of Mantua and Charles I of England; after reaching Christ church it was for long hung in the college kitchen, before being recognised for what it was in the 20th century.\n", "\nArtist: Annibale Carracci\nArtwork Name: Corpse of Christ\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/annibale-carracci/the-dead-christ-1585\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Corpse of Christ is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Annibale Carracci, dating to c. 1583-1585 and housed in the Staatsgalerie of Stuttgart, Germany.\r The work, dating to Carracci's early career, is a manifest homage to Andrea Mantegna's Dead Christ, which he had perhaps seen in the Aldobrandini collection.

The painting is in the Museo del Prado, Madrid. Annibale Carracci was one of the most well known Italian Baroque painters of the seventeenth century. The Carracci brothers established an academy of art called Accademia degli Incamminati, which pioneered the development of Bolognese Painting. Annibale Carracci and Caravaggio were among the most influential artists of this century, who through their unique artistic styles led to the transition from Mannerist to Baroque. Annibale was born in Bologna in 1560 and died in Rome in 1609.\r Venus, Adonis and Cupid illustrates the influence of known artists such as Titian, Correggio, Veronese, as well as ancient Greek sculptures. Venus, Adonis and Cupid has three main figures, arranged in a forest landscape: Venus holding Cupid who points at her and Venus looking at Adonis across from her as Adonis looks back. Adonis is accompanied by his hunting dogs as he moves the tree branches and reveals Venus. The painting is arranged diagonally, with loose and fine brushstrokes giving it a naturalistic look. The colors are muted throughout most of the piece but vivid in the figures, drawing the viewer\u2019s attention. This composition is influenced strongly by Veronese.\r The myth of Venus and Adonis was first told in Ovid\u2019s Metamorphosis: Book X. This is the most widely accepted version of the myth. Adonis was a handsome young man, more beautiful than even the Gods, although his creation was from an incestuous union. Venus was playing with her son Cupid in the woods and was punctured in the chest by one of his arrows. The wound was deeper than she thought, and before it healed she witnessed Adonis. She immediately fell passionately in love with him and forgot about her other lovers and her life on Olympus. She followed him and helped him with his hunting, dressing like Diana. She warned him that \u201cbravery is unsafe when faced with the brave. Do not be foolish, beware of endangering me, and do not provoke the creatures nature has armed, lest your glory is to my great cost.\u201d  When Venus left by her swans to the skies, Adonis provoked a wild boar and was killed. She fled to his aid but was too late so she turned his blood into a flower, which would bloom each year to remind her of her grief and their love.\r Venus, Adonis and Cupid illustrates Ovid\u2019s Myth. Annibale captures the scene when the lovers first meet. The blood from Cupid\u2019s arrow can still be seen on Venus's chest. The scene eliminates the dramatic and narrative elements and focuses on the emotional ones, portrayed through gestures and eye contact. The \u201csensuality of the encounter is conveyed through the three dimensionality of the volumes and the gentle chiaroscuro,\u201d  particularly seen in Venus. Annibale was strongly influenced by Correggio in this element, as well as the use of gestures to engage the viewer. The scene is also directly correlated with Titian\u2019s poesia, a series of mythological paintings for Felipe II, among them Venus and Adonis. The use of the three figures as well as the poetic interpretation of the myth is reminiscent to Titian\u2019s painting. Annibale crosses the realm of artistic style between realism and ideal classicalism in this painting. His earlier works, such as The Bean Eater, reflect just one of Annibale\u2019s impressive range of artwork and his capability to produce realistic works. He paints genre scenes, landscapes, portraits, mythological/classical scenes, as well as caricatures and religious commissions.\n", "\nArtist: Annibale Carracci\nArtwork Name: The Choice of Heracles\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/annibale-carracci/the-choice-of-heracles\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Choice of Hercules is a painting by the Italian Baroque painter Annibale Carracci.

The subject is the Choice of Hercules.\r Carracci, who was in Rome from the late 1595 or early 1596, was commissioned this work by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese for the ceiling of his camerino in his family's palace. In 1662 it was moved to the Farnese ducal seat in Parma. The work is considered one of Carracci's masterworks for its balanced rendering of a poetical ideal, graphically influenced by the artist's contact with Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel frescoes and Rome's classical remains, such as the Farnese Hercules or the Laocoon group.\r A vigorous and plastic Hercules is depicted with two women flanking him, who represent the opposite destinies which life could reserve him: on the left Virtue is calling him to the hardest path leading to glory through hardship, while the second, a woman with worldly pleasures, the easier path, is enticing him to vice.\r Behind Hercules is a palm, which, through the leaves and the branches (a symbol of military victory and fame), hints to Hercules' future heroic life.

Dating from c. 1604, it remains in the palace for which it was painted in Rome as part of the collection of the Galleria Doria Pamphilj.\r The painting, depicting the biblical New Testament event of the Flight into Egypt, was commissioned in 1603 by Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini for the family chapel in his palace in Rome, later known as Palazzo Doria Pamphilj. The commission includes six paintings in six lunettes, which were executed by Carracci and his pupils (including Francesco Albani, Domenichino and Giovanni Lanfranco).\r The work is frequently regarded as a key work in Baroque landscape painting and is the \"most celebrated example\" of the \"new landscape style\" Carracci developed in Rome of \"carefully constructed landscape panoramas\", according to Rudolf Wittkower. For John Rupert Martin it is \"the archetypal classical landscape, later to be emulated with variations by Domenichino, Poussin and Claude ... the small scale of the figures in relation to the spacious natural setting at once establishes a new priority in which landscape takes first place and history second\"; though insofar as it is \"new\", that is for Italian painting, as such works had been common in Northern painting since Joachim Patinir began to use the same reversal of scale almost a century before. The journey of the Holy Family is echoed by other moving elements including the sheep, birds, cows and the camels on the ridge at left.\r Wittkower sees in it \"a heroic and aristocratic conception of Nature tamed and ennobled by the presence of man\", as such works always contain a large man-made feature, here the castle \"severely composed of horizontals and verticals\" under which the party moves. They are placed at the meeting of two diagonals represented by the sheep and the river, \"thus figures and buildings are intimately blended with the carefully arranged pattern of the landscape\".\r Kenneth Clark mentions the work as an example of the \"ideal landscape\" driven to promote itself in the hierarchy of genres by emulating (in the absence of much evidence of what classical landscape painting was like) an essentially literary vision, largely derived from the pastoral poems of Virgil: \"the features of which it is composed must be chosen from nature, as poetic diction is chosen from ordinary speech, for their elegance, their ancient associations, and their faculty of harmonious combination. Ut pictura poesis\". Clark's praise of the work is noticeably faint, as it lacks the spirit he finds in Giorgione and Claude in the same tradition: \"At their best, as in the lunettes in the Doria Gallery, Annibale Carracci's landscapes are admirable pieces of picture-making, in which agreeably stylized parts are built up into a harmonious whole. We recognize the science which has gone into the construction of the castle in the centre of the Flight into Egypt...

His movements in this period are not certain. According to his contemporary Giulio Mancini he stayed for a short time with Monsignor Pandulfo Pucci in the Palazzo Colonna, but disliked the way Pucci treated him and left after a few months. (Pucci fed his boarders exclusively on greens, and Caravaggio referred to him later as 'Monsignor Salad'). He copied religious pictures for Pucci, (none survive), and apparently did a few pieces of his own for personal sale, of which Boy Peeling a Fruit would be the only known example. The piece may also date from slightly later, when he was working for Giuseppe Cesari, the \"cavaliere d'Arpino\". As Caravaggio is said to have been painting only \"flowers and fruit\" for d'Arpino, this would again be a personal piece done for sale outside the workshop, but it was among the works seized from d'Alpino by Cardinal Scipione Borghese in 1607, together with two other early Caravaggios, the Young Sick Bacchus and the Boy with a Basket of Fruit. It is not known how these works came to be in Cesari's collection at the time.\r The fruit being peeled by the boy is something of a mystery. Sources indicate it may be a pear, which is probably correct but has been questioned; it may be a nectarine or plum, several of which lie on the table, but these are not usually peeled; some have suggested a bergamot, a pear-shaped citrus fruit grown in Italy, but others object that the bergamot is sour and practically inedible.\r Seen as a simple genre painting, it differs from most in that the boy is not 'rusticated,' that is, he is depicted as clean and well-dressed instead of as a 'cute' ragamuffin. An allegoric meaning behind the painting is plausible, given the complex Renaissance symbology of fruit. Caravaggio scholar John T. Spike has recently suggested that the boy demonstrates resistance to temptation by ignoring the sweeter fruits (fruits of sin) in favour of the bergamot, but no specific reading is widely accepted.\r The model is thought to bear a resemblance to the angel in Caravaggio's Ecstasy of Saint Francis and to the boy dressed as Cupid on the far left in his Young Musicians, both about 1595 to 1597.\r Several other versions of the work are known, all of which may be by Caravaggio; it has been suggested that at the early stage of his career, while he was still in the studio of Cavalier d'Arpino, Caravaggio's paintings were put in the studio's shop window, and if they attracted the attention of passing buyers, Caravaggio would feed the demand with additional versions. In 1996 John T. Spike identified the likely original as a painting auctioned in London that year, although others have argued that either the Ishizuka version or that in the British Royal Collection could be the prototype. The version in the Royal Collection has been on display in the Cumberland Gallery of Hampton Court Palace since 2004.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Boy with a Basket of Fruit\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/boy-with-a-basket-of-fruit-1593-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBoy with a Basket of Fruit, c.1593, is a painting generally ascribed to Italian Baroque master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, currently in the Galleria Borghese, Rome.\r The painting dates from the time when Caravaggio, newly arrived in Rome from his native Milan, was making his way in the competitive Roman art world. The model was his friend and companion, the Sicilian painter Mario Minniti, at about 16 years old. The work was in the collection of Giuseppe Cesari, the Cavaliere d'Arpino, seized by Cardinal Scipione Borghese in 1607, and may therefore date to the period when Caravaggio worked for d'Arpino \"painting flowers and fruits\" in his workshop; but it may date from a slightly later period when Caravaggio and Minniti had left Cavalier d'Arpino's workshop (January 1594) to make their own way selling paintings through the dealer Costantino. Certainly it cannot predate 1593, the year Minniti arrived in Rome. It is believed to predate more complex works from the same period (also featuring Minniti as a model) such as The Fortune Teller and the Cardsharps (both 1594), the latter of which brought Caravaggio to the attention of his first important patron, Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte. Vittorio Sgarbi notes certain Murillesque portraiture qualities in the painting that could easily point to other painters in the Arpino workshop.\r At one level the painting is a genre piece designed to demonstrate the artist's ability to depict everything from the skin of the boy to the skin of a peach, from the folds of the robe to the weave of the basket. The fruit is especially exquisite, and Professor Jules Janick of the Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture at Purdue University, Indiana, has analysed them from a horticulturalist's perspective:\r The analysis indicates that Caravaggio is being realistic, in capturing only what was in the fruit basket; he idealizes neither their ripeness nor their arrangement\u2014yet almost miraculously, we are still drawn in to look at it; for the viewer it is very much a beautiful and exquisite subject.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Young Sick Bacchus\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/young-sick-bacchus\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Young Sick Bacchus (Italian: Bacchino Malato), also known as the Sick Bacchus or the Self-Portrait as Bacchus, is an early self-portrait by the Baroque artist Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, dated between 1593 and 1594. It now hangs in the Galleria Borghese in Rome. According to Caravaggio's first biographer, Giovanni Baglione, it was a cabinet piece painted by the artist using a mirror.\r The painting dates from Caravaggio's first years in Rome following his arrival from his native Milan in mid-1592. Sources for this period are inconclusive and probably inaccurate, but they agree that at one point the artist fell extremely ill and spent six months in the hospital of Santa Maria della Consolazione. According to a 2009 article in the American medical publication Clinical Infectious Diseases, the painting indicates that Caravaggio's physical ailment likely involved malaria, as the jaundiced appearance of the skin and the icterus in the eyes are indications of some active hepatic disease causing high levels of bilirubin.\r The Sick Bacchus was among the many works making up the collection of Giuseppe Cesari, one of Caravaggio's early employers, which was seized by the art-collector Cardinal-Nephew Scipione Borghese in 1607, together with the Boy Peeling Fruit and Boy with a Basket of Fruit.\r Apart from its assumed autobiographical content, this early painting was likely used by Caravaggio to market himself, demonstrating his virtuosity in painting genres such as still-life and portraits and hinting at the ability to paint the classical figures of antiquity. The three-quarters angle of the face was among those preferred for late renaissance portraiture, but what is striking is the grimace and tilt of the head, and the very real sense of the suffering; a feature that most Baroque art shares.\r The still-life can be compared with that contained in slightly later works such as the Boy With a Basket of Fruit and the Boy Bitten by a Lizard where the fruits are in a much better condition, reflecting no doubt Caravaggio's improved condition, both physically and mentally.\r The painting shows the influence of his teacher, the Bergamasque Simone Peterzano, in the utilization of the tensed musculature depiction, and of the austere Lombard school style in its attention to realistic details.\r Cindy Sherman, as part of her History Portrait series (1989-1990), produced a parody on Sick Bacchus, an ironic photographic self-portrait named Untitled # 224.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Cardsharps\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/cardsharps-1594-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Cardsharps (painted around 1594) is a painting by the Italian Baroque artist Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio.

He painted it when he was attempting an independent career after leaving the workshop of the Cavaliere Giuseppe Cesari d'Arpino, for whom he had been painting \"flowers and fruit\", finishing the details for the Cavaliere's mass-produced (and massive) output. Caravaggio left Arpino's workshop in January 1594 and began selling works through the dealer Costantino, with the assistance of Prospero Orsi, an established painter of Mannerist grotesques (masks, monsters, etc.). Orsi introduced Caravaggio to his extensive network of contacts in the world of collectors and patrons.\r The painting shows an expensively-dressed but unworldly boy playing cards with another boy. The second boy, a cardsharp, has extra cards tucked in his belt behind his back, out of sight of the mark but not the viewer, and a sinister older man is peering over the dupe's shoulder and signaling to his young accomplice. The second boy has a dagger handy at his side, and violence is not far away.\r It was the second such painting Caravaggio created. The first, The Fortune Teller, had drawn attention, and this painting extended his reputation, small though it was at this stage. The subjects of The Fortune Teller and Cardsharps offered something new, realistic scenes of street life, especially with this beautifully rendered attention to little details such as the split fingers on the older man's gloves, or the teenage cheat's anxious glance at his master. The psychological insight is equally striking, the three figures bound together by the common drama, yet each with his own unique part within the larger play \u2013 for if the innocent is being duped, the other boy is no older, another innocent being corrupted even as he cheats his gull.\r Cardsharps, with its mixture of brutal low-life realism and luminous Venetian delicacy, was much admired, and Orsi \"went around acclaiming (Caravaggio's) new style and heightening the reputation of his work.\" Caravaggio appears to have produced more than one version of the work (as discussed in the provenance section below). Over fifty copies and variants made by other painters have survived, with artists such as Georges de La Tour painting their own appreciations of the theme.\r Whether through Costantino or Orsi, Caravaggio came to the notice of the prominent collector Cardinal Francesco Del Monte, who purchased Cardsharps and became the artist's first important patron, giving him lodgings in his Palazzo Madama behind the Piazza Navona, then as now one of the principal squares in Rome.\r From Del Monte's collection the work entered the collection of Cardinal Antonio Barberini, nephew of the Pope Urban VIII (whose pre-elevation portrait, Portrait of Maffeo Barberini, Caravaggio would paint in 1598), in Rome and was passed through the Colonna-Sciarra family. It eventually disappeared in the 1890s, and was rediscovered in 1987 in a private collection in Z\u00fcrich; it was subsequently sold to and is currently in the collection of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Musicians\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/musicians\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Musicians or Concert of Youths (c. 1595) is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571\u20131610). It is held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, where it has been since 1952. It underwent extensive restoration in 1983.\r Caravaggio entered the household of Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte sometime in 1595, and The Musicians is thought to have been his first painting done expressly for the cardinal. His biographer, the painter Baglione, says he \"painted for the Cardinal youths playing music very well drawn from nature and also a youth playing a lute,\" the latter presumably being The Lute Player, which seems to form a companion-piece to The Musicians.\r The picture shows four boys in quasi-Classical costume, three playing various musical instruments or singing, the fourth dressed as Cupid and reaching towards a bunch of grapes.\r Caravaggio seems to have composed the painting from studies of two figures. The central figure with the lute has been identified with Caravaggio's companion Mario Minniti, and the individual next to him and facing the viewer is possibly a self-portrait of the artist. The cupid bears a strong resemblance to the boy in Boy Peeling Fruit, done a few years before, and also to the angel in Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy.\r The manuscripts show that the boys are practicing madrigals celebrating love, and the eyes of the lutenist, the principal figure, are moist with tears\u2014the songs presumably describe the sorrow of love rather than its pleasures. The violin in the foreground suggests a fifth participant, implicitly including the viewer in the tableau.\r Scenes showing musicians were a popular theme at the time\u2014the Church was supporting a revival of music and new styles and forms were being tried, especially by educated and progressive prelates such as Del Monte. This scene, however, is clearly secular rather than religious, and harks back to the long-established tradition of \"concert\" pictures, a genre originating in Venice and exemplified, in its earlier form, by Titian's Le concert champ\u00eatre.\r This was Caravaggio's most ambitious and complex composition to date, and the artist has evidently had difficulties with painting the four figures separately\u2014they don't relate to each other or to the picture-space, and the overall effect is somewhat clumsy. The painting is in poor condition, and the music in the manuscript has been badly damaged by past restorations, although a tenor and an alto part can be made out. Nevertheless, despite considerable paint loss, the work's originality remains undimmed.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/saint-francis-of-assisi-in-ecstasy\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy (or The Ecstasy of Saint Francis) is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. It is held in the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut.\r The painting was the first of Caravaggio's religious canvasses, and is thought to date from 1595, when he had recently entered the household of Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte. It was presumably painted at the behest of Del Monte, and is thought to be one of the first paintings done by the artist as \"Del Monte's painter\", as he is believed to have described himself over the next few years while living in Palazzo Madama. It shows Saint Francis of Assisi (the Cardinal's name-saint) at the moment of receiving the signs of the Stigmata, the wounds left in Christ's body by the Crucifixion. The story is told by one of Francis' companions, Brother Leo. In 1224 Francis retired to the wilderness with a small number of his followers to contemplate God. On the mountainside at night Brother Leo saw a six-winged seraph (one of the higher Orders of angels) come down to Francis in answer to the saint's prayer that he might know both Christ's suffering and His love:\r Caravaggio's painting is less dramatic than the account given by Leo - the six-winged seraph is replaced by a two-winged angel, and there is none of the violent confrontation described by Leo - no streams of fire, no pools of blood, no shouts or fiery images of Christ. Just the gentle-seeming angel, bulking far larger than the unconscious saint, and Francis' companions in the middle distance, almost invisible in the darkness.\r The subject had been a popular one ever since the 13th century: Giotto treated it about 1290, and Giovanni Bellini painted a famous version about 1480-85. Caravaggio's version is much more intimate and marks a sharp change of key: the saint, who has the features of Del Monte, seems to sink back peacefully into the arms of a boy (who bears a marked resemblance to the boy in Boy Peeling a Fruit and to the winged Cupid on the far left of The Musicians, and even more to the boy being cheated in Cardsharps) wearing a sheet and some stage-prop wings. There is very little to indicate the subject beyond the saint's Franciscan robe - no sign of the Stigmata, or blood, except the wound in his heart, nor of the fearsome seraph. Yet the atmosphere remains genuinely spiritual, the two figures lit by an unearthly effulgence in the dark night-time landscape where strange glimmerings flicker on the horizon. The scene is at once real and unreal. Del Monte kept it till the end of his life, and several copies went into circulation and were greatly valued.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Bacchus\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/bacchus-1596-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBacchus (c. 1595) is a painting by Italian Baroque master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571\u20131610). It is held in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.\r The painting shows a youthful Bacchus reclining in classical fashion with grapes and vine leaves in his hair, fingering the drawstring of his loosely draped robe. On a stone table in front of him is a bowl of fruit and a large carafe of red wine; with his left hand he holds out to the viewer a shallow goblet of the same wine, apparently inviting the viewer to join him.\r Bacchus was painted shortly after Caravaggio joined the household of his first important patron, Cardinal Del Monte, and reflects the humanist interests of the Cardinal's educated circle. It was not in the cardinal's collection at his death, and may have been a gift to the Grand Duke in Florence. It was unknown until 1913. When it was found in a storeroom of the Uffizi Galleries, it had never been catalogued or framed.\r Bacchus' offering of the wine with his left hand, despite the obvious effort this is causing the model, has led to speculation that Caravaggio used a mirror to assist himself while working from life, doing away with the need for drawing. In other words, what appears to us as the boy's left hand was actually his right. This would accord with the comment by Caravaggio's early biographer, the artist Giovanni Baglione, that Caravaggio did some early paintings using a mirror. English artist David Hockney made Caravaggio's working methods a central feature of his thesis (known as the Hockney-Falco thesis) that Renaissance and later artists used some form of camera lucida. The model for Bacchus might have been Caravaggio's friend Mario Minniti, whom he had used before in The Musicians.\r It was discovered upon closer investigation that Caravaggio included a miniature self-portrait of himself painting the subject in the reflection of the offered glass.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Basket of Fruit\nArtwork Genre: still life\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/basket-of-fruit-1596-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBasket of Fruit (c.1599) is a still life painting by the Italian Baroque master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571\u20131610), which hangs in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana (Ambrosian Library), Milan.\r It shows a wicker basket perched on the edge of a ledge. The basket contains a selection of summer fruit:\r Much has been made of the worm-eaten, insect-predated, and generally less than perfect condition of the fruit. In line with the culture of the age, the general theme appears to revolve about the fading beauty, and the natural decaying of all things. Scholars also describe the basket of fruit as a metaphor of the Church.\r A recent X-ray study revealed that it was painted on an already used canvas painted with grotesques in the style of Caravaggio\u2019s friend Prospero Orsi, who helped the artist in his first breakthrough into the circles of collectors such as his first patron, Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, around 1594/1595, and who remained close to him for many years thereafter.\r Scholars have had more than their usual level of disagreement in assigning a date to the painting: John T. Spike places it in 1596; Catherine Puglisi believes that 1601 is more probable; and practically every year in between has been advanced. Puglisi's reasoning seem solid, (the basket in this painting seems identical with the one in the first of Caravaggio's two versions of Supper at Emmaus - even the quince seems to be the same piece of fruit), but no consensus has emerged.\r In 1607 it was part of Cardinal Federico Borromeo\u2019s collection, a provenance which raises the plausibility of a conscious reference to the Book of Amos. Borromeo, who was archbishop of Milan, was in Rome approximately 1597-1602 and a house guest of Del Monte in 1599. He had a special interest in the Northern European painters such as Paul Bril and Jan Brueghel the Elder, who were also in Rome at the time, (indeed, he took Breughel into his own household), and in the way they did landscapes and flowers in paintings as subjects in their own right, something not known at the time in Italian art. He would have seen the way Caravaggio did still life as incidental accessories in paintings such as Boy Bitten by a Lizard, Bacchus, in Del Monte's collection, and The Lute Player in the collection of Del Monte's friend Vincenzo Giustiniani. The scholarly Giustiniani wrote a treatise on painting years later, wherein, reflecting the hierarchical conventions of his day, he placed flowers \"and other tiny things\" only fifth on a twelve-scale register, but he said also that Caravaggio once said to him \"that it used to take as much workmanship for him to do a good picture of flowers as it did to do one of human figures.\"\r Like its doppelganger in Supper at Emmaus, the basket seems to teeter on the edge of the picture-space, in danger of falling out of the painting and into the viewer's space instead. In the Supper this is a dramatic device, part of the way in which Caravaggio creates the tension of the scene; here, trompe l'oeil seems to be almost the whole purpose of the painting, if we subtract the possible didactic element. But the single element that no doubt attracted its original owner, and still catches attention today, is the extraordinary quasi-photographic realism of the observation which underlies the illusionism. Basket of Fruit can be compared with the same artist's Still Life with Fruit (c. 1603), a painting which John Spike identifies as \"the source of all subsequent Roman still-life paintings.\"\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Boy Bitten by a Lizard\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/boy-bitten-by-a-lizard\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBoy Bitten by a Lizard (Italian: Ragazzo morso da un ramarro) is a painting by the Italian Baroque painter Caravaggio. It exists in two versions, both believed to be authentic works of Caravaggio, one in the Fondazione Roberto Longhi in Florence, the other in the National Gallery, London.\r Both versions are thought to date from the period 1594\u20131596. According to art historian Roberto Longhi, the latter end of this period seems more likely, given that the paintings have all the signs of the early works painted in the household of Caravaggio's sophisticated patron Cardinal Francesco Del Monte, and that Caravaggio didn't enter the Cardinal's Palazzo Madama until some time in 1595.\r As with all of Caravaggio's early output, much remains conjectural, and the identity of the model has been debated.\r One theory is that the model was Mario Minniti, Caravaggio's companion and the model for several other paintings from the period; the bouffant, curly dark hair and pursed lips look similar, but in other pictures such as Boy with a Basket of Fruit and The Fortune Teller Mario looks less effeminate.\r Michael Fried has proposed instead that the painting is a disguised self-portrait of Caravaggio. Fried argues that the subject's hands \u2013 one stretched out, the other raised up \u2013 are in a similar position to those of a painter holding a palette while painting.\r According to Leonard J. Slatkes, the painting's symbolism likely derives from the Apollo Sauroktonos theme in which a poisonous salamander triumphs over the god, while the arrangement of various fruits suggests The Four Temperaments, with the salamander being the symbol of fire in Caravaggio's time. The salamander also had phallic connotations, and the painting might have been inspired by a Martial epigram: \"Ad te reptani, puer insidiose, lacertae Parce: cupit digitis illa perire tuis. (Spare this lizard crawling towards you, treacherous boy/It wants to die between your fingers)\r The affected pose may have been the inevitable result of the experiment Caravaggio appears to have been undertaking here: observing and recording acute emotions \u2013 surprise and fear \u2013 in a situation where real surprise was impossible and where the pose had to be held for a considerable period. Critics of Caravaggio's insistence on painting only from life would later point out this limitation of his method: it lent itself to marvelously realistic (if theatrical) static compositions, but not to scenes involving movement and violence. It would only be in his late period, when he seems to have worked more from imagination, that Caravaggio would be able to completely overcome this problem. Nevertheless, Boy Bitten by a Lizard is an important work in the artist's early oeuvre precisely because it shows a way out from the airless stillness of very early works such as Boy Peeling a Fruit and Sick Bacchus, and even the implied violence but actual stasis of pieces such as Cardsharps.\r As was first suggested by Roberto Longhi, Caravaggio has probably borrowed the motif of biting a finger from a Boy Bitten by a Crab, a drawing by a prominent Renaissance artist Sofonisba Anguissola.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Jupiter, Neptune and Pluto\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: fresco\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/jupiter-neptune-and-pluto-1597-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJupiter, Neptune and Pluto (c. 1597) is a painting by Italian Baroque master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. It is located in the Villa Aurora, the former hunting lodge of the erstwhile Villa Ludovisi, Rome. It is unusually painted in oils on plaster. and hence it is not a fresco, although it is sometimes (incorrectly) referred to as such. Oil painting is normally on canvas or, less frequently, on wood.\r According to an early biographer, one of Caravaggio's aims was to discredit critics who claimed that he had no grasp of perspective. The three figures demonstrate the most dramatic foreshortening imaginable. They contradict claims that Caravaggio always painted from live models. The artist seems to have used his own face for all three gods.\r The painting was done for Caravaggio's patron Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte and painted on the ceiling of the cardinal's garden casino of his country estate, which later became known as the Villa Ludovisi. The cardinal had a keen interest alchemy. Caravaggio has painted an allegory of the alchemical triad of Paracelsus: Jupiter stands for sulphur and air, Neptune for mercury and water, and Pluto for salt and earth. Each figure is identified by his beast: Jupiter by the eagle, Neptune by the hippocamp, and Pluto by the three-headed dog Cerberus. Jupiter is reaching out to move the celestial sphere in which the Sun revolves around the Earth. Galileo was a friend of Del Monte but had yet to make his mark on cosmology.\r The Villa Aurora is private property in the hands of the Ludovisi family and can be visited upon request.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Medusa\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/medusa-1597-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nCaravaggio painted two versions of Medusa, the first in 1596 and the other presumably in 1597.\r The first version (1596) is also known as Murtula, after poet Gaspare Murtola (d. 1624), who wrote of it: \"Flee, for if your eyes are petrified in amazement, she will turn you to stone.\" It measures 48 by 55\u00a0cm and is signed Michel A\u00a0F (Latin: Michel Angelo Fecit), \"Michel Angelo made [this]\", Michelangelo being Caravaggio's first name.

The painting portrays a repentant Mary Magdalene, bowed over in penitent sorrow as she leaves behind her dissolute life, its trappings abandoned beside her. At the time of its completion, ca. 1594-1595, the painting was unconventional for its contemporary realism and departure from traditional Magdalene iconography. It has invited both criticism and praise, with speculation even into the 21st century as to Caravaggio's intentions. The work hangs in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery in Rome.\r The painting depicts a young brunette, squatting or kneeling on a low chair, with her hands cradled in her lap. By her side is a collection of jewelry and a stoppered bottle of liquid, nearly three-quarters full. Her gaze is averted from the viewer, her head turned downward in a position that has been compared to traditional portrayals of the crucified Jesus Christ. A single tear runs down one cheek to the side of her nose.\r The painting was completed ca. 1594-1595, during which time Caravaggio was residing with Giuseppe Cesari and Fantin Petrignani. The painting was almost certainly commissioned by Pietro Vittrice, guardaroba of Pope Gregory XIII. Caravaggio was known to have used several prostitutes as models for his works, and historians have speculated that Anna Bianchini is featured in this painting. Contemporary biographers indicate Bianchini may also have featured in Caravaggio's Death of the Virgin, Conversion of the Magdalen (as Martha) and Rest on the Flight into Egypt (as the Virgin Mary). It may be the first religious painting ever completed by Caravaggio.\r The painting represents a departure from the standard paintings of the penitent Mary Magdalene of Caravaggio's day, both in portraying her in contemporary clothing and, in the words of biographer John Varriano (2006), avoiding \"the pathos and languid sensuality\" with which the subject was generally treated. Indeed, most of the many depictions of the subject in art showed the Magdalen with no clothing at all, as in Titian's painting of 1533, it having fallen apart during the thirty years she spent, according to medieval legend, repenting in the desert after the Ascension of Jesus. It was Caravaggio's departure into realism that shocked his original audience; according to Hilary Spurling in The New York Times Book Reviews (2001), \"contemporaries complained that his Mary Magdalene looked like the girl next door drying her hair alone at home on her night in.\" Decades after the painting's completion, 17th-century art biographer Gian Pietro Bellori opined that Caravaggio had feigned religious imagery by adding items associated with Mary Magdalene\u2014a carafe of oil and discarded jewelry\u2014to an otherwise modern genre scene. But Jesuit poet Giuseppe Silos evidently did not regard the work as feigned spirituality. Rather, in his Pinacotheca sive Romana pictura et sculptura, published in 1673, he praised it and its painter elaborately:\r In his controversial contemporary biography M (2001), Peter Robb suggested that the realism of the piece and the subtle hints of violence he perceived\u2014broken pearls and the subject's swollen face and hands\u2014might suggest a political dimension, a commentary on the mistreatment of courtesans in Caravaggio's time by police in Rome. Based on records from Bianchini's life, Robb speculates that Bianchini might have been publicly whipped in the custom of the day, the ointment in the jar her treatment for this, her injury Caravaggio's inspiration.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Portrait of a Courtesan\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/portrait-of-a-courtesan-1597-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of a Courtesan (also known as Portrait of Fillide) was a painting by the Baroque master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. Painted between 1597 and 1599, it was destroyed in Berlin in 1945 and is known only from photographs. It has been suggested that the portrait represents the goddess Flora.\r Earlier scholars identified the flower she presses to her breast as orange blossom or bergamot, symbol of marriage and fidelity, and claimed the subject as Caterina Campi, wife of Caravaggio's friend Onorio Longhi. Caravaggio scholar John Gash, however, identifies the flowers as \"definitely jasmine\", symbol of erotic love, and therefore more suitable to a courtesan than to a respectable married woman. The portrait belonged to Caravaggio's patron, Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, and the 1638 inventory of the Giustiniani collection lists a \"portrait of a courtesan named Fillide\", identified by modern scholars as Fillide Melandroni.\r Fillide figured prominently in Caravaggio's work in the closing years of the 1590s, appearing as Saint Catherine, as Mary in Martha and Mary Magdalene, and as Judith in Judith Beheading Holofernes. She may have appeared even more frequently - a considerable number of Caravaggio's works are now lost - but she seems to vanish from his paintings after 1599. If sophisticated patrons such as Giustiniani represented one pole of Caravaggio's life, the world of Fillide was the other. She was one of Rome's most successful prostitutes, much sought after by the Roman elite; but she had her true existence in the streets. In February 1599 she was arrested together with a young man named Ranuccio Tomassoni, who seems to have been her pimp, (he came from a good family but was continually turning up in police records in the company of prostitutes, and not as a customer), and charged with creating a disturbance in connection with a noisy mardi gras party in her house. Fillide's friends included another prostitute, Anna Bianchini, who modelled for Caravaggio as Mary Magdalene in his Penitent Magdalene, as Martha (opposite Fillide) in Martha and Mary Magdalene, and as the Mother of Christ in Rest on the Flight into Egypt. Tomassoni would also appear again, but not in paintings: in 1606 Caravaggio killed Tomassoni in an attempt to castrate him.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Rest on the Flight into Egypt\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/rest-on-the-flight-into-egypt\n\nWikipedia Article:\nRest on the Flight into Egypt (c. 1586 creation) is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery, Rome. The Rest on the Flight into Egypt, like the Flight into Egypt, was a popular subject in art, but Caravaggio's composition, with an angel playing the viol to the Holy Family, is unusual.\r The scene is based not on any incident in the Bible itself, but on a body of tales or legends that had grown up in the early Middle Ages around the Bible story of the Holy Family fleeing into Egypt for refuge on being warned that Herod the Great was seeking to kill the Christ Child. According to the legend, Joseph and Mary paused on the flight in a grove of trees; the Holy Child ordered the trees to bend down so that Joseph could take fruit from them, and then ordered a spring of water to gush forth from the roots so that his parents could quench their thirst. This basic story acquired many extra details during the centuries.\r Caravaggio shows Mary asleep with the infant Jesus, while Joseph holds a manuscript for an angel who is playing a hymn to Mary on the viol.\r The date of the painting is disputed. According to Caravaggio's contemporary Giulio Mancini, this painting and the Penitent Magdalene, together with an unidentified painting of Saint John the Evangelist, was done while Caravaggio was staying with Monsignor Fantino Petrignani, shortly after leaving the workshop of Giuseppe Cesari. This probably happened in January 1594.\r However, there are problems with accepting Mancini's statement. To begin, none of these three works were listed in Petragnani's inventory of 1600, although it is possible that they could have been painted for another patron. More seriously, the painting has an obvious and direct compositional source in Annibale Carracci's Judgement of Hercules, which was completed early in 1596 and widely admired: the pose of Caravaggio's angel, for example, is closely based on that of Carracci's figure of Vice.\r While John Gash (2003) accepts Mancini's testimony, others, including Peter Robb and Helen Langdon (both 1998), have raised the possibility that it was painted for Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, who made Caravaggio in effect his household artist from about 1595 or 1596. The sophisticated treatment is appropriate for the cardinal's intellectual tastes and interests (the music held by Joseph is a motet by the Flemish composer Noel Bauldeweyn, with a text from the Song of Songs dedicated to the Madonna, Quam pulchra es, \"How beautiful you are\"), and it is unlikely that the artist would embark on a work like this other than as a direct commission.\r This was the first large-scale work done by Caravaggio, and is compositionally more ambitious and more successful than The Musicians, of about 1595. It is also one of the very rare landscapes from this artist who seems always to have been painting in a prison cell, a room at a tavern, or at night - one critic has joked that all the sky in all Caravaggio's 80-odd works would add up to a few square centimeters of paint. The painting was apparently sold to the Pamphilj by the early 17th century. Caravaggio's Lombard and Venetian heritage are evident in the treatment of the landscape and in the luminous tonalities. Like most depictions of the flight to Egypt this is a peaceful moment, one in which the scenery is to be enjoyed, more gardenscape than landscape. The luminous figure of the adolescent angel, at once serene and sensuous, holds the centre of the group. The mother and child grouping, one of many that Caravaggio would paint, is comparable in its delicacy and realism to the best that the thousands in the canon can offer.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: John the Baptist\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/john-the-baptist\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJohn the Baptist (sometimes called John in the Wilderness) was the subject of at least eight paintings by the Italian Baroque artist Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571\u20131610).\r The story of John the Baptist is told in the Gospels. John was the cousin of Jesus, and his calling was to prepare the way for the coming of the Messiah. He lived in the wilderness of Judea between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, \"his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.\" He baptised Jesus in the Jordan, and was eventually killed by Herod Antipas when he called upon the king to reform his evil ways. John was frequently shown in Christian art, identifiable by his bowl, reed cross, camel's skin and lamb. The most popular scene prior to the Counter-Reformation was of John's baptism of Jesus, or else the infant Baptist together with the infant Jesus and Mary his mother, frequently supplemented by the Baptist's own mother St Elizabeth. John alone in the desert was less popular, but not unknown. For the young Caravaggio, John was invariably a boy or youth alone in the wilderness. This image was based on the statement in the Gospel of Luke that \"the child grew and was strengthened in spirit, and was in the deserts until the day of his manifestation to Israel.\" These works allowed a religious treatment of the partly clothed youths he liked to paint at this period.\r Apart from these works showing John alone, mostly dated to his early years, Caravaggio painted three great narrative scenes of John's death: the great Execution in Malta, and two sombre Salomes with his head, one in Madrid, and one in London.\r The ascription of this painting to Caravaggio is disputed - the alternative candidate is Bartolomeo Cavarozzi, an early follower. It is in the collection of the Museo Tesoro Catedralicio, Toledo (Spain), and John Gash (see references below) speculates that it may have been one of the paintings done by Caravaggio for the prior of the Hospital of the Consolation, as Caravaggio's early biographer Mancini tells us. According to Mancini the prior \"afterwards took them with him to his homeland\"; unfortunately, one version of Mancini's manuscript says the prior's homeland was Seville, while another says Sicily. There was a Spanish prior of the hospital in 1593, and he may not have left until June 1595. Gash cites scholar A.E. Perez Sanchez's view that while the figure of the saint has certain affinities with Cavarozzi's style, the rest of the picture does not, \"and the extremely high quality of certain passages, especially the beautifully depicted vine leaves...is much more characteristic of Caravaggio.\" Gash also points to the gentle chiaroscuro and the delicate treatment of contours and features, and similar stylistic features in early works by Caravaggio such as The Musicians and Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy. If this and other paintings by Caravaggio were indeed in Seville at an early date they may have influenced Vel\u00e1zquez in his early works. However, the arguments in favour of Cavarozzi are strong, and he is known to have travelled to Spain about 1617-1619.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Martha and Mary Magdalene\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/martha-and-mary-magdalene\n\nWikipedia Article:\nMartha and Mary Magdalene (c. 1598) is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. It is in the Detroit Institute of Arts. Alternate titles include Martha Reproving Mary, The Conversion of the Magdalene and the Alzaga Caravaggio.\r Caravaggio's Martha and Mary is dated to 1598\u201399, when he was in the entourage of Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte. Little is known of its history between those years and 25 June 1971, when its owners attempted to sell it at Christie's in London (lot 21). It remained unsold at 130,000 guineas, despite the confidence of the restorer Juan Corradini of Buenos Aires. Later converts were Benedict Nicolson and Mina Gregori (as late as January 1974). Today it is generally considered an autograph work. It was acquired by the Detroit Institute of Art in 1973.\r It is thought that the painting was originally in the collection of Caravaggio's patron Ottavio Costa. His will of 6 August 1606, contains a painting by this description and states that Riggerio Tritonio, secretary of Cardinal Montalto, is to choose between the Martha and Mary and a Saint Francis; the painting not selected was to go to Costa's friend and colleague Giovanni Enriquez de Herrera. Since the Saint Francis later appears in the inventory of Tritinio, it has been assumed that the Martha and Mary passed to Herrera, probably in late 1606.\r Giovanni Enriquez de Herrera died on 1 March 1610, without a will, thus leaving his four sons to decide on the fate of his possessions. It has been speculated that it remained in Rome until the 1620s, but the only firm evidence for its provenance after the Herrera family is a seal and inscriptions on the back of the original canvas with the names Niccol\u00f2 Panzani, Emilia Panzani and Anna E. Panzani. This family has not been traced.\r Since its rediscovery, its influence has become apparent, most notably in the number of copies, a now lost work by Carlo Saraceni and a well known version by Orazio Gentileschi, today in Munich.\r The painting shows the sisters Martha and Mary from the New Testament. Martha is in the act of converting Mary from her life of pleasure to the life of virtue in Christ. Martha, her face shadowed, leans forward, passionately arguing with Mary, who twirls an orange blossom between her fingers as she holds a mirror, symbolising the vanity she is about to give up. The power of the image lies in Mary's face, caught at the moment when conversion begins.\r Martha and Mary was painted while Caravaggio was living in the palazzo of his patron, Cardinal Del Monte. His paintings for Del Monte fall into two groups: the secular genre pieces such as The Musicians, The Lute Player, and Bacchus - all featuring boys and youths in somewhat claustophobic interior scenes - and religious images such as Rest on the Flight into Egypt and Ecstasy of Saint Francis. Among the religious paintings was a group of four works featuring the same two female models, together or singly. The models were two well-known courtesans who frequented the palazzi of Del Monte and other wealthy and powerful art patrons, and their names were Anna Bianchini and Fillide Melandroni. Anna Bianchini appeared first as a solitary Mary Magdalene in the Penitent Magdalene of about 1597. Fillide Melandroni appeared in a secular Portrait of a Courtesan done the same year for Del Monte's friend and fellow art-lover, the banker Vincenzo Giustiniani. In 1598 Caravaggio painted Fillide again as Saint Catherine, capturing a beauty full of intelligence and spirit. In Martha and Mary the two are shown together, Fillide perfectly fitted to the role of Mary, Anna to the mousier but insistent presence as Martha.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Maffeo Barberini\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/portrait-of-maffeo-barberini\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Maffeo Barberini (c. 1598) is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio.\r It is held in a private collection in Florence.\r Barberini, 30 years old and from the eminent Florentine Barberini family, was a rapidly rising Church prelate, a friend of Caravaggio's patron Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, and himself a poet and patron of the arts.\r Barberini's support would continue into later years \u2013 in 1603 he commissioned a Sacrifice of Isaac from Caravaggio.

It is part of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection of Madrid.\r Saint Catherine of Alexandria was a popular figure in Catholic iconography. She was of noble origins, and dedicated herself as a Christian after having a vision. At the age of 18 she confronted the Roman Emperor Maximus (presumably this refers to Galerius Maximianus), debated his pagan philosophers, and succeeded in converting many of them to Christianity. Imprisoned by the emperor, she converted his empress and the leader of his armies. Maximus executed her converts (including the empress) and ordered that Catherine herself be put to death on a spiked wheel. The wheel reportedly shattered the moment Catherine touched it. Maximus then had her beheaded. She became patron saint of libraries and librarians, as well as teachers, archivists, and all those associated with wisdom and teaching, and all those whose livelihoods depended upon wheels. The year of her martyrdom was traditionally held to have been 305, (the year of a major persecution of Christians under Galerius), and her feastday was celebrated on 25 November. In 1969 the Church, persuaded by the overwhelming opinion of historians that Catherine had probably never existed, removed her from the calendar of saints; by 2002, while the majority of historians had not changed their minds, the Church had, and she was reinstated. Her qualities are supposed to be those of beauty, fearlessness, virginity, and intelligence.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: David and Goliath\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/david-and-goliath\n\nWikipedia Article:\nDavid and Goliath (or David with the Head of Goliath or David Victorious over Goliath) is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio (1571\u20131610). It was painted in about 1599, and is held in the Museo del Prado, Madrid. Two later versions of the same theme are currently to be seen in Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (David with the Head of Goliath), and in Rome's Galleria Borghese (David with the Head of Goliath).\r The David and Goliath in the Prado was painted in the early part of the artist's career, while he was a member of the household of Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte. It shows the Biblical David as a young boy (in accordance with the Bible story) fastening the head of the champion of the Philistines, the giant Goliath, by the hair. The light catches on David's leg, arm and flank, on the massive shoulders from which Goliath's head has been severed, and on the head itself, but everything else is dark. Even David's face is almost invisible in the shadows. A wound on Goliath's forehead shows where he has been felled by the stone from David's sling. The overwhelming impression is of some action intensely personal and private - no triumph, no armies, no victory.\r Caravaggio originally showed Goliath's face fixed in wild-eyed open-mouthed terror, tongue rolling, eyeballs swivelled to the edges of the sockets. In the finished painting the melodrama is banished: the drama is transferred from Goliath to the quietly efficient David, his face almost hidden, intent on his work with his hands in his enemy's hair, kneeling almost casually on the man's torso.\r This painting and two others done at about the same time \u2013 the first version of Sacrifice of Isaac and the first John the Baptist \u2013 were taken to Spain shortly after they were made, where they were frequently copied and made a deep impression on art in that country.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Narcissus\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/narcissus\n\nWikipedia Article:\nNarcissus is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio, painted circa 1597\u20131599. It is housed in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica in Rome.\r The painting was originally attributed to Caravaggio by Roberto Longhi in 1916. This is one of only two known Caravaggios on a theme from Classical mythology, although this is due more to the accidents of survival than the artist's oeuvre. Narcissus, according to told the poet Ovid in his Metamorphoses, is a handsome youth who falls in love with his own reflection. Unable to tear himself away, he dies of his passion, and even as he crosses the Styx continues to gaze at his reflection (Metamorphoses 3:339-510).\r The story of Narcissus was often referenced or retold in literature, for example, by Dante (Paradiso 3.18-19) and Petrarch (Canzoniere 45-46). The story was well known in the circles of such collectors in which Caravaggio was moving in this period, such as those of Cardinal Francesco Maria del Monte and the banker Vincenzo Giustiniani. Caravaggio's friend, the poet Giambattista Marino, wrote a description of Narcissus.\r The story of Narcissus was particularly appealing to artists according to the Renaissance theorist Leon Battista Alberti: \"the inventor of painting ... was Narcissus ... What is painting but the act of embracing by means of art the surface of the pool?\"\r Caravaggio painted an adolescent page wearing an elegant brocade doublet, leaning with both hands over the water, as he gazes at this own distorted reflection. The painting conveys an air of brooding melancholy: the figure of Narcissus is locked in a circle with his reflection, surrounded by darkness, so that the only reality is inside this self-regarding loop. The 16th century literary critic Tommaso Stigliani\u00a0(it) explained the contemporary thinking that the myth of Narcissus \"clearly demonstrates the unhappy end of those who love their things too much.\"\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: The Fortune Teller\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/the-fortune-teller-1599\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Fortune Teller is a painting by Italian Baroque artist Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. It exists in two versions, both by Caravaggio, the first from 1594 (now in the Musei Capitolini in Rome), the second from 1595 (which is in the Louvre museum, Paris). The dates in both cases are disputed.\r The painting shows a foppishly-dressed boy (in the second version the model is believed to be Caravaggio's companion, the Sicilian painter Mario Minniti), having his palm read by a gypsy girl. The boy looks pleased as he gazes into her face, and she returns his gaze. Close inspection of the painting reveals what the young man has failed to notice: the girl is removing his ring as she gently strokes his hand.\r Caravaggio's biographer Giovanni Pietro Bellori relates that the artist picked the gypsy girl out from passers-by on the street in order to demonstrate that he had no need to copy the works of the masters from antiquity:\r This passage is often used to demonstrate that the classically trained Mannerist artists of Caravaggio's day disapproved of Caravaggio's insistence on painting from life instead of from copies and drawings made from older masterpieces. However, Bellori ends by saying, \"and in these two half-figures [Caravaggio] translated reality so purely that it came to confirm what he said.\" The story is probably apocryphal - Bellori was writing more than half a century after Caravaggio's death, and it doesn't appear in Mancini's or in Giovanni Baglione, the two contemporary biographers who had known him - but it does indicate the essence of Caravaggio's revolutionary impact on his contemporaries - beginning with The Fortune Teller - which was to replace the Renaissance theory of art as a didactic fiction with art as the representation of real life.\r The 1594 Fortune Teller aroused considerable interest among younger artists and the more avant garde collectors of Rome, but, according to Mancini, Caravaggio's poverty forced him to sell it for the low sum of eight scudi. It entered the collection of a wealthy banker and connoisseur, the Marchese Vincente Giustiniani, who became an important patron of the artist. Giustiniani's friend, Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, purchased the companion piece, Cardsharps, in 1595, and at some point in that year Caravaggio entered the Cardinal's household.\r For Del Monte, Caravaggio painted a second version of The Fortune Teller, copied from the Giustiniani but with certain changes. The undifferentiated background of the 1594 version becomes a real wall broken by the shadows of a half-drawn curtain and a window sash, and the figures more completely fill the space and defining it in three dimensions. The light is more radiant, and the cloth of the boy's doublet and the girl's sleeves more finely textured. The dupe becomes more childlike and more innocently vulnerable, the girl less wary-looking, leaning in towards him, more in command of the situation.\r The Fortune Teller is one of two known genre pieces painted by Caravaggio in the year 1594, the other being Cardsharps. The Fortune Teller is believed to be the earlier of the two, and dates from the period during which the artist had recently left the workshop of the Giuseppe Cesari to make his own way selling paintings through the dealer Costantino.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Judith Beheading Holofernes\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/judith-beheading-holofernes-1599\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJudith Beheading Holofernes is a painting of Judith beheading Holofernes by Caravaggio, painted in c.1599-1599. The widow Judith first charms the Assyrian general Holofernes, then decapitates him in his tent. The painting was rediscovered in 1950 and is part of the collection of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica in Rome.\r The deuterocanonical Book of Judith tells how Judith served her people by seducing and pleasuring Holofernes, the Assyrian General. Judith gets Holofernes drunk, then seizes her sword and slays him: \"Approaching to his bed, she took hold of the hair of his head.\" (Judith, 13:7-8).\r Caravaggio's approach was, typically, to choose the moment of greatest dramatic impact, the moment of the decapitation itself. The figures are set out in a shallow stage, theatrically lit from the side, isolated against the inky, black background. Judith and her maid Abra stand to the right, partially over Holofernes, who is vulnerable on his back. X-rays have revealed that Caravaggio adjusted the placement of Holofernes' head as he proceeded, separating it slightly from the torso and moving it slightly to the right. The faces of the three characters demonstrate his mastery of emotion, Judith in particular showing in her face a mix of determination and repulsion. Artemisia Gentileschi and others were deeply influenced by this work and even surpassed Caravaggio's physical realism, but it has been argued that none matched his capture of Judith's psychological ambivalence.\r The model for Judith is probably the Roman courtesan Fillide Melandroni, who posed for several other works by Caravaggio around this year; the scene itself, and especially the details of blood and decapitation, were presumably drawn from his observations of the public execution of Beatrice Cenci a few years before.\r A painting believed by some to be Caravaggio's second version of Judith Beheading Holofernes was discovered in Toulouse in 2014. An export ban was placed on the painting by the French government while tests were carried out to establish its authenticity.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Calling of Saint Matthew\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/calling-of-saint-matthew\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Calling of Saint Matthew is a masterpiece by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, depicting the moment at which Jesus Christ inspires Matthew to follow him. It was completed in 1599\u20131600 for the Contarelli Chapel in the church of the French congregation, San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, where it remains today. It hangs alongside two other paintings of Matthew by Caravaggio, The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (painted around the same time as the Calling) and The Inspiration of Saint Matthew (1602).\r Over a decade before, Cardinal Matthieu Cointerel (in Italian, Matteo Contarelli) had left in his will funds and specific instructions for the decoration of a chapel based on themes related to his namesake, St Matthew. The dome of the chapel was decorated with frescoes by the late Mannerist artist Cavalier D'Arpino, Caravaggio's former employer and one of the most popular painters in Rome at the time. But as D'Arpino became busy with royal and papal patronage, Cardinal Francesco Del Monte, Caravaggio's patron and also the prefect of the Fabbrica of St Peter's (the Vatican office for Church property), intervened to obtain for Caravaggio his first major church commission and his first painting with more than a handful of figures.\r The Calling hangs opposite The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew. While the Martyrdom was probably the first to be started, the Calling was, by report, the first to be completed. The commission for these two lateral paintings \u2014 the Calling and the Martyrdom \u2014 is dated July 1599, and final payment was made in July 1600. Between the two, at the altar, is The Inspiration of Saint Matthew (1602).\r The painting depicts the story from the Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 9:9): \"Jesus saw a man named Matthew at his seat in the custom house, and said to him, \"Follow me\", and Matthew rose and followed Him.\" Caravaggio depicts Matthew the tax collector sitting at a table with four other men. Jesus Christ and Saint Peter have entered the room, and Jesus is pointing at Matthew. A beam of light illuminates the faces of the men at the table who are looking at Jesus Christ.\r There is some debate over which man in the picture is Saint Matthew, as the surprised gesture of the bearded man at the table can be read in two ways.\r Most writers on the Calling assume Saint Matthew to be the bearded man, and see him to be pointing at himself, as if to ask \"Me?\" in response to Christ's summons. This theory is strengthened when one takes into consideration the other two works in this series, The Inspiration of Saint Matthew, and The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew. The bearded man who models as Saint Matthew appears in all three works, with him unequivocally playing the role of Saint Matthew in both the \"Inspiration\" and the \"Martyrdom\".\r A more recent interpretation proposes that the bearded man is in fact pointing at the young man at the end of the table, whose head is slumped. In this reading, the bearded man is asking \"Him?\" in response to Christ's summons, and the painting is depicting the moment immediately before a young Matthew raises his head to see Christ. Other writers describe the painting as deliberately ambiguous.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Conversion of Saint Paul\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: oil,wood\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/conversion-of-saint-paul-1600\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Conversion of Saint Paul (or Conversion of Saul), by the Italian painter Caravaggio, is housed in the Odescalchi Balbi Collection of Rome. It is one of at least two paintings by Caravaggio of the same subject, the Conversion of Paul. Another is The Conversion of Saint Paul on the Road to Damascus, in the Cerasi Chapel of Santa Maria del Popolo.\r The painting, together with a Crucifixion of Saint Peter, was commissioned by Monsignor (later Cardinal) Tiberio Cerasi, Treasurer-General to Pope Clement VIII, in September 1600. According to Caravaggio's early biographer Giovanni Baglione, both paintings were rejected by Cerasi, and replaced by the second versions which hang in the chapel today. The dates of completion and rejection are determined from the death of Cerasi in May 1601. Baglione states that the first versions of both paintings were taken by Cardinal Giacomo Sannessio, but another early writer, Giulio Mancini, says that Sannessio's paintings were copies. Nevertheless, most scholars are satisfied that this is the first version of the Conversion of Paul.\r The painting records the moment when Saul of Tarsus, on his way to Damascus to annihilate the Christian community there, is struck blind by a brilliant light and hears the voice of Christ saying, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?...And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid, but they heard not the voice...\" (Acts 22:6-11). Elsewhere Paul claims to have seen Christ during a vision, and it is on this basis that he grounds his claim be recognised as an Apostle: \"Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?\" (I Corinthians 9:1).\r Caravaggio biographer Helen Langdon describes style of Conversion as \"an odd blend of Raphael and clumsy rustic realism,\" but notes how the composition, with its jagged shapes and irrational light which licks out details for their dramatic impact, creates \"a sense of crisis and dislocation [in which] Christ disrupts the mundane world.\"\r Several modern commentators (including John Gash and Peter Robb) have questioned whether the rejection of the first versions of Caravaggio's two paintings was quite so straightforward as the record makes it seem, and speculate that Cardinal Sannessio may have seized the opportunity of Cerasi's unexpected death on 3 May 1601 to, in effect, seize the paintings. Certainly there is no obvious reason for the rejection, and the two second versions which replaced them were, if the surviving first version of the Conversion is a guide, (the first Crucifixion of Peter has disappeared), far more unconventional than the first.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/martyrdom-of-saint-matthew-1600\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (Italian: Martirio di San Matteo; 1599\u20131600) is a painting by the Italian master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. It is located in the Contarelli Chapel of the church of the French congregation San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, where it hangs opposite The Calling of Saint Matthew and beside the altarpiece The Inspiration of Saint Matthew, both by Caravaggio. It was the first of the three to be installed in the chapel, in July 1600.\r The painting shows the martyrdom of Saint Matthew the Evangelist, author of the Gospel of Matthew. According to tradition, the saint was killed on the orders of the king of Ethiopia while celebrating Mass at the altar. The king lusted after his own niece, and had been rebuked by Matthew, for the girl was a nun, and therefore the bride of Christ. Cardinal Contarelli, who had died several decades earlier, had laid down very explicitly what was to be shown: the saint being murdered by a soldier sent by the wicked king, some suitable architecture, and crowds of onlookers showing appropriate emotion. (See the article on the Contarelli Chapel).\r The commission (which, strictly speaking, was from his patron, Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, rather than from the church itself), caused Caravaggio considerable difficulty, as he had never painted so large a canvas, nor one with so many figures. X-rays reveal two separate attempts at the composition before the one we see today, with a general movement towards simplification through reduction in the number of figures, and reduction \u2013 ultimately elimination \u2013 of the architectural element.\r The first version revealed by the x-rays is in the Mannerist style of the most admired artist in Rome at the time, Giuseppe Cesari, with a crowd of small figures amidst massive architecture. It must have seemed static and distanced. The second version turned to Raphael for a model, adding a crowd of onlookers displaying fear and pity, including a woman who presumably represented the nun. This was in line with the crowded scene requested by Cardinal Contarelli and with the tenets of Mannerism, which demanded bodies and buildings defined by perspective and drawing, but Caravaggio had already developed a personal style in which bodies were defined by light and darkness and in which backgrounds were eliminated.\r At this point Caravaggio left off the Martydom and turned his attention to the companion piece, the Calling. This drew on his own earlier genre-pieces, Cardsharps and The Fortune Teller, but writ large. Apparently re-inspired, or perhaps with renewed self-confidence, Caravaggio turned back to the Martydom, but this time working in his own idiom. The third version dropped the architecture, reduced the number of actors, and moved the action closer to the viewer; more than this, it introduced the dramatic chiaroscuro which picks out the most important elements of the subject, in much the same way a spotlight picks out the action on a stage, but centuries before spotlights were imagined, and chose to represent the moment of greatest drama, as the murderer is about to plunge his sword into the fallen saint. This is the version we see today, the action caught at the moment of highest drama, the bystanders reduced to supporting roles by the sharply selective light, the whole giving the impression of a moment seen as if in a lightning flash.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Crucifixion of Saint Peter\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/crucifixion-of-saint-peter-1601\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Crucifixion of Saint Peter (Italian: Crocifissione di san Pietro; 1601) is a work by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, painted for the Cerasi Chapel of Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome. Across the chapel is a second Caravaggio work depicting the Conversion of Saint Paul on the Road to Damascus (1601). On the altar between the two is an Assumption of the Virgin Mary by Annibale Carracci.\r The painting depicts the martyrdom of St. Peter by crucifixion\u2014Peter asked that his cross be inverted so as not to imitate his God, Jesus Christ, hence he is depicted upside down. The large canvas shows Ancient Romans, their faces shielded, struggling to erect the cross of the elderly but muscular apostle. Peter is heavier than his aged body would suggest, and his lifting requires the efforts of three men, as if the crime they perpetrate already weighs on them.\r The two Caravaggios, as well as the altarpiece by Carracci, were commissioned in September 1600 by Monsignor Tiberio Cerasi, who died shortly afterwards. Caravaggio's original versions of both paintings were rejected. They passed into the private collection of Cardinal Sannessio, and several modern scholars including John Gash, Helen Lagdon and Peter Robb, have speculated that Sennassio may have taken advantage of Cerasi's sudden death to seize some pictures by Rome's most famous new painter. The first Conversion of Paul has been identified with The Conversion of Saint Paul (1600) in the Odescalchi Balbi Collection, Rome, but the first version of the Crucifixion of Peter has disappeared; some scholars have identified it with a painting now in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, but this is not generally accepted (in the Hermitage catalog Martyrdom of St. Peter is attributed, with a question mark, to Lionello Spada and dated on the first quarter of the 17th century). In all events, the second versions, which seem to have been more unconventional than the first, were accepted without comment by the executors of Cerasi's estate in 1601.\r The two saints, Peter and Paul, together represent the foundations of the Catholic Church, Peter the rock upon which Christ declared his Church to be built (Gospel of Matthew 16:18), and Paul who founded the seat of the church in Rome. Caravaggio's paintings were thus intended to symbolise Rome's (and Cerasi's) devotion to the Princes of the Apostles in this church which dominated the great piazza welcoming pilgrims as they entered the city from the north, representing the great Counter-Reformation themes of conversion and martyrdom and serving as propaganda against the twin threats of backsliding and Protestantism.\r Caravaggio, or his patron, appear to have had in mind the Michelangelo frescoes in the Vatican's Capella Paolina (1546\u20131550) when choosing the subjects for these paintings. However, the Caravaggio scene is far more stark than the confusing melee miracle of the mannerist Michelangelo fresco in the Vatican.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Amor Victorious\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/amor-victorious-1602\n\nWikipedia Article:\nAmor Vincit Omnia (\"Love Conquers All\", known in English by a variety of names including Amor Victorious, Victorious Cupid, Love Triumphant, Love Victorious, or Earthly Love) is a painting by the Italian early realist / post-Mannerist artist Caravaggio.\r Amor Vincit Omnia shows Amor, the Roman Cupid, wearing dark eagle wings, half-sitting on or perhaps climbing down from what appears to be a table. Scattered around are the emblems of all human endeavours \u2013 violin and lute, armour, coronet, square and compasses, pen and manuscript, bay leaves, and flower, tangled and trampled under Cupid\u2019s foot. The painting illustrates the line from Virgil's Eclogues X.69, Omnia vincit amor et nos cedamus amori (\"Love conquers all; let us all yield to love!\"). A musical manuscript on the floor shows a large \"V\". It has therefore been suggested also that the picture is a coded reference to the attainments of Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani: his Genoese family ruled Chios (until the island's capture by the Turks) in 1622, hence the coronet; the cultivated Marchese also wrote about music and painting (pen, manuscript and musical instruments), was constructing an imposing new palazzo (geometrical instruments), studied astronomy (astral sphere), and was praised for his military prowess (armour). The symbology thus holds the possible reading: Vincenzo Conquers All. Giustiniani is said to have prized it above all other works in his collection.\r The subject was common for the age. Caravaggio\u2019s treatment is remarkable for the realism of his Cupid \u2013 where other depictions, such as a contemporary Sleeping Cupid by Battistello Caracciolo, show an idealised, almost generic, beautiful boy, Caravaggio\u2019s Cupid is highly individual, charming but not at all beautiful, all crooked teeth and crooked grin: one feels that one would recognise him in the street. The shock of the Caravaggio, quite apart from the dramatic chiaroscuro lighting and the photographic clarity, is the mingling of the allegorical and the real, this sense it gives of a child who is having a thoroughly good time dressing up in stage-prop wings with a bunch of arrows and having his picture painted. Nevertheless, despite the clear indications of Caravaggio\u2019s practice of painting direct from a live model, there is an undeniable resemblance to the pose of Michelangelo's Victory now in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, and it is likely the artist had this in mind.\r The painter Orazio Gentileschi lent Caravaggio the wings as props to be used in the painting, and this allows fairly precise dating of 1602\u20133. It was an immediate success in the circles of Rome\u2019s intellectual and cultural elite. A poet immediately wrote three madrigals about it, and another wrote a Latin epigram in which it was first coupled with the Virgilian phrase Omnia Vincit Amor, although this did not become its title until the critic Giovanni Pietro Bellori wrote his life of Caravaggio in 1672.\r Inevitably, much scholarly and non-scholarly ink has been spilled over the alleged eroticism of the painting. Yet the homoerotic content was perhaps not so apparent to Giustiniani\u2019s generation as it has become today. Naked boys could be seen on any riverbank or seashore, and the eroticisation of children is very much a cultural artefact of the present-day rather than Caravaggio's. The story that the Marchese kept Amor hidden behind a curtain relates to his reported wish that it should be kept as a final pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance for visitors, to be seen only when the rest of the collection had been viewed \u2013 in other words, the curtain was to reveal the painting, not to hide it. (According to the historian Joachim von Sandrart, who catalogued the Giustiniani collection in the 1630s, the curtain was only installed at his urging at that time). The challenge is to see the Amor Vincit through 17th century eyes.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Incredulity of Saint Thomas\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/incredulity-of-saint-thomas\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Incredulity of Saint Thomas is a painting of the subject of the same name by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio, c. 1601\u20131602. It is housed in the Sanssouci Picture Gallery, now a museum, in Potsdam, Germany.\r It shows the episode that gave rise to the term \"Doubting Thomas\" which, formally known as the Incredulity of Thomas, had been frequently represented in Christian art since at least the 5th century, and used to make a variety of theological points. According to St John's Gospel, Thomas the Apostle missed one of Jesus's appearances to the Apostles after His resurrection, and said \"Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.\" John 20:25 A week later Jesus appeared and told Thomas to touch Him and stop doubting. Then Jesus said, \"Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\" John 20:29\r In the painting, Thomas's face shows surprise as Jesus holds his hand and guides it into the wound. The absence of a halo emphasizes the corporeality of the risen Christ. The work is in chiaroscuro.\r This picture is probably related to Saint Matthew and the Angel (1602) and the Sacrifice of Isaac (1603), all having a model in common. It belonged to Vincenzo Giustiniani before entering the Prussian royal collection, surviving the Second World War intact.\r A second version of \"The Incredulity of Saint Thomas\" has been re-discovered in Trieste, Italy in a private collection. It is published in the Maurizio Marini corpus catalogico \"Caravaggio - Pictor praestantissimus\" Newton & Compton - 2005 in the position Q50. The painting is declared \"d'interesse artistico e storico\" by the \"Ministero per i Beni e le Attivit\u00e0 Culturali Sopraintendenza Regionale del Fiuli - Venezia Giulia\". Its authenticity has been attested by several experts including Maurizio Marini, Maria Ranacher and Sir Denis Mahon and confirmed by a court in Trieste.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Inspiration of Saint Matthew\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/inspiration-of-saint-matthew-1602-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Inspiration of Saint Matthew (1602) is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio. Commissioned by the French Cardinal Matteo Contarelli, the canvas hangs in Contarelli chapel altar in the church of the French congregation San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, Italy. It is one of three Caravaggio canvases in the chapel: hanging between the larger earlier canvases of The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew, and The Calling of Saint Matthew. This was not an easy commission for Caravaggio, and at least two of the three paintings had to be either replaced or repainted to satisfy his patron, the Cardinal Del Monte.\r It is instructive to compare the two versions of the latter painting to see how provocative and controversial Caravaggio was in his time. Unfortunately, the first, rejected, version of this theme was destroyed in World War II, and we only have black and white and enhanced color reproductions. In the first version, Saint Matthew and the Angel, the angel stands close to Matthew the Evangelist personal space and engages in what appears more direct intervention than divine inspiration. The angel intertwines with the old man, apparently whispering inspiration into his ear. The rejected painting can be compared to the earlier Caravaggio canvas of the Rest on the Flight into Egypt.\r In the work featured on the altar, the angel belongs to an aerial and sublime dimension, enveloped in an encircling rippled sheet. The restless Matthew leans to work, as the angel enumerates for him the work to come. All is darkness but for the two large figures. Matthew appears to have rushed to his desk, his stool teetering into our space. His expression is sober.\r It is thought the contemporary styles of Caravaggio and Carracci were at odds with each other, and non overlapping. In this light it is instructive to compare and contrast a similar canvas, by Carracci's pupil, Giovanni Lanfranco presently in Piacenza as well as a painting on a similar theme by Rembrandt.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Sacrifice of Isaac\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/sacrifice-of-isaac-1602\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Sacrifice of Isaac is the title of two paintings from c. 1598 - 1603 depicting the sacrifice of Isaac. The paintings could be painted by the Italian master Caravaggio (1571\u20131610) but there is also strong evidence that they may have been the work of Bartolomeo Cavarozzi, a talented early member of the Caravaggio following who is known to have been in Spain about 1617-1619.\r The Sacrifice of Isaac in the Piasecka-Johnson Collection in Princeton, New Jersey, is a disputed work that was painted circa 1603. According to Giulio Mancini, a contemporary of Caravaggio and an early biographer, the artist, while convalescing in the Hospital of the Consolazione, did a number of paintings for the prior who took them home with him to Seville. (The hospital had a Spanish prior from 1593 to around mid-1595). This would date the work to the mid-1590s, but it seems far more sophisticated than anything else known from that period of Caravaggio's career, and Peter Robb, in his 1998 biography of Caravaggio, dates it to about 1598. The model for Isaac bears a close resemblance to the model used for the John the Baptist now in the museum of Toledo cathedral, which suggests that the two should be considered together. The presence of paintings by Caravaggio in Spain at an early date is important for the influence they may have had on the young Vel\u00e1zquez, but there is also strong evidence that they may have been the work of Bartolomeo Cavarozzi, a talented early member of the Caravaggio following who is known to have been in Spain about 1617-1619.\r The painting shows the moment when Abraham, about to sacrifice his son Isaac in obedience to God's command, is stayed by an angel who offers him a ram in Isaac's place. The scene is lit with the dramatically enhanced chiaroscuro (tenebrism) with which Caravaggio was to revolutionize Western art, falling like a stage spotlight on the face of the youthful angel; the faces of Abraham and Isaac are in shadow, but show acute emotions; the gestures of the hands are acutely eloquent, the angel's hand resting on the ram's head in imitation of the way Abraham's left hand rests on the head of his son, the Patriarch's other hand holding the knife but already relaxing as he listens to the angel. The three figures and the ram are shown without background or context, with nothing to distract from the powerful psychological drama as God's promise is delivered.\r The second Sacrifice of Isaac is housed in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. According to the early biographer Giovanni Bellori, Caravaggio painted a version of this subject for Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, the future Pope Urban VIII, and a series of payments totalling one hundred scudi were made to the artist by Barberini between May 1603 and January 1604. Caravaggio had previously painted a Portrait of Maffeo Barberini, which presumably pleased the cardinal enough for him to commission this second painting.\r Isaac has been identified as Cecco Boneri, who appeared as Caravaggio's model in several other pictures. Recent X-ray analysis showed that Caravaggio used Cecco also for the angel, and later modified the profile and the hair to hide the resemblance.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Saint Matthew and the Angel\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/saint-matthew-and-the-angel-1602\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Matthew and the Angel (1602) is a painting from the Italian master Caravaggio (1571\u20131610), completed for the Contarelli Chapel in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome. It was destroyed in 1945 and is now known only from black-and-white photographs and enhanced color reproductions.\r Caravaggio was known for painting very realistically, using models instead of standard convention and idealization. He made his figures lifelike and relatable, as opposed to portraying unrealistic or phony poses. In this instance, however, the patrons wanted an idealization of the beloved Saint, someone who its viewers could admire and strain to be like. They did not want a bumbling peasant who looked as if he just walked in off the street. With the angel sweeping down and the Saint\u2019s stool teetering in movement, it is arguably one of Caravaggio\u2019s earliest examples of his dynamic style. It was a much more exciting composition than the first. Even though Caravaggio changed the composition to suit the desires of the patron, you can still see his own style under the more refined subject of Saint Matthew.\r Saint Matthew and the Angel was completed in 1602. A part of the collection of the former Kaiser Friedrich Museum, it was destroyed by fire at the end of World War II while stored in an anti-aircraft bunker in Berlin. This work, by a pillar of the Baroque movement, might have provided new information about the artist and patron. Reproductions of the original still survive.\r Saint Matthew and the Angel was created as a commission for the Contarelli Chapel. Caravaggio was previously commissioned to paint two scenes of the saint\u2019s life, and after the patrons were satisfied with them, a third was commissioned.\r The Contarelli Chapel was dedicated to Saint Matthew. With funds left for its building left in 1585, it was completed in 1600. Cardinal Del Monte played a major part in orchestrating the decoration of its interior, and was the one who suggested Caravaggio as the painter of the scenes of Saint Matthew\u2019s life. The altar was to be composed of two Caravaggio paintings as well as a statue of the saint by Flemish artist Jacob Cobaert. However, the church was not pleased with the statue and Caravaggio was re-hired to do another piece as the center for the altar, to show Saint Matthew writing the Gospel under the guidance of an angel. Caravaggio depicted the Saint as an unlearned peasant, gaping in the presence of the angel. The church rejected Caravaggio's irreverent presentation of the saint, and Caravaggio replaced it with a more glorifying image, The Inspiration of Saint Matthew, which remains in the Chapel today.\r The comparison is not perfect because the only images available of the lost Saint Matthew and the Angel are black and white photographs that were taken before World War II. The lost painting showed Saint Matthew as poorly groomed, with dirty feet. Although this was the style of Caravaggio, the church leaders thought it was too crude and did not want to have what looked like a peasant hanging in their sacred altarpiece. In addition, they thought that this Matthew did not match the other two paintings that Caravaggio had already done. It was apparently disconnected and therefore had no place with the others. The second piece keeps true to the same subject, but with a few changes. Matthew looks more like the other two Matthews in the altar. The Saint is now more serious and in control in the presence of the angel. Instead of being fully controlled by the angel, Saint Matthew is only encouraged by the angel in the second one. He is working more on his own accord.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Supper at Emmaus\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/supper-at-emmaus-1602\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Supper at Emmaus is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio, executed in 1601, and now in the National Gallery in London. Originally this painting was commissioned and paid for by Ciriaco Mattei, brother of cardinal Girolamo Mattei.\r The painting depicts the moment when the resurrected but incognito Jesus, reveals himself to two of his disciples (presumed to be Luke and Cleopas) in the town of Emmaus, only to soon vanish from their sight (Gospel of Luke 24: 30-31). Cleopas wears the scallop shell of a pilgrim. The other apostle wears torn clothes. Cleopas gesticulates in a perspectively-challenging extension of arms in and out of the frame of reference. The standing groom, forehead smooth and face in darkness, appears oblivious to the event. The painting is unusual for the life-sized figures, the dark and blank background. The table lays out a still-life meal. Like the world these apostles knew, the basket of food teeters perilously over the edge.\r In the Gospel of Mark (16:12) Jesus is said to have appeared to them \"in another form\", which may be why he is depicted beardless here, as opposed to the bearded Christ in Calling of St Matthew, where a group of seated money counters is interrupted by the recruiting Christ. It is also a recurring theme in Caravaggio's paintings to find the sublime interrupting the daily routine. The unexalted humanity is apt for this scene, since the human Jesus has made himself unrecognizable to his disciples, and at once confirms and surmounts his humanity. Caravaggio seems to suggest that perhaps a Jesus could enter our daily encounters. The dark background envelops the tableau.\r Caravaggio painted another version of the Supper at Emmaus (now in the Brera, Milan) in 1606. By comparison, the gestures of figures are far more restrained, making presence more important than performance. This difference possibly reflects the circumstances of Caravaggio's life at that point (he had fled Rome as an outlaw following the death of Ranuccio Tomassoni), or possibly, recognising the ongoing evolution of his art, in the intervening five years he had come to recognise the value of understatement.\r  Media related to Supper at Emmaus by Caravaggio (London) at Wikimedia Commons\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Taking of Christ\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/taking-of-christ-1602\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Taking of Christ (Italian: Presa di Cristo nell'orto or Cattura di Cristo) is a painting, of the arrest of Jesus, by the Italian Baroque master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. Originally commissioned by the Roman nobleman Ciriaco Mattei in 1602, it is housed in the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin.\r There are seven figures in the painting: from left to right they are John, Jesus, Judas, three soldiers (the one farthest to the right barely visible in the rear), and a man holding a lantern to the scene. They are standing, and only the upper three-quarters of their bodies are depicted. Judas has just kissed Jesus to identify him for the soldiers. The figures are arrayed before a very dark background, in which the setting is obscured. The main light source is not evident in the painting but comes from the upper left; the lesser light source is the lantern held by the man at the right (believed to be a self-portrait of Caravaggio; also, presumably, representing St Peter, who would first betray Jesus by denying him, and then go on to bring the light of Christ to the world). At the far left, a man (St John) is fleeing; his arms are raised, his mouth is open in a gasp, his cloak is flying and being snatched back by a soldier. The flight of the terrified John contrasts with the entrance of the artist; scholars claim that Caravaggio is making the point that even a sinner one thousand years after the resurrection has a better understanding of Christ than does his friend.\r Two of the more puzzling details of the painting are, one, the fact that the heads of Jesus and St. John seem to visually meld together in the upper left corner, and, two, the fact of the prominent presence, in the very center of the canvas and in the foremost plane of the picture, of the arresting officer's highly polished, metal-clad arm. Regarding the detail of the polished metal arm of the soldier in the center of the picture, Franco Mormando suggests that it was meant by the artist to serve as a mirror, a mirror of self-reflection and examination of conscience (such as in Caravaggio's Conversion of Mary Madgalene in Detroit): as do many spiritual writers and preachers of the period, the artist may be 'inviting his viewers to see themselves reflected in the behavior of Judas' through their own daily acts of betrayal of Jesus, that is, through their sin.\r The central group, composed of Jesus, Judas and the soldier with an outstretched hand, resembles a 1509 woodcut by Albrecht D\u00fcrer from his Small Passion series.\r By the late 18th century, the painting was thought to have disappeared, and its whereabouts remained unknown for about 200 years. In 1990, Caravaggio\u2019s lost masterpiece was recognized in the residence of the Society of Jesus in Dublin, Ireland. The rediscovery was published in November 1993.\r The painting had been hanging in the Dublin Jesuits\u2019 dining room since the early 1930s but had long been considered a copy of the lost original by Gerard van Honthorst, also known as Gherardo delle Notti, one of Caravaggio\u2019s Dutch followers. This erroneous attribution had already been made while the painting was in the possession of the Roman Mattei family, whose ancestor had originally commissioned it. In 1802, the Mattei sold it, as a work by Honthorst, to William Hamilton Nisbet, in whose home in Scotland it hung until 1921. Later in that decade, still unrecognised for what it was, the painting was sold to an Irish paediatrician, Marie Lea-Wilson, who eventually donated it in the 1930s to the Jesuit Fathers in Dublin, in gratitude for their support following the shooting of her husband, Capt. Percival Lea-Wilson, a District Inspector in the Royal Irish Constabulary in Gorey, County Wexford, by the Irish Republican Army on 15 June 1920.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Crowning with Thorns\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/crowning-with-thorns-1603\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Crowning with Thorns was the subject of two paintings by the Italian master Caravaggio. The first version, dated to around 1604\u20131605, is now in the Cassa di Risparmi e Depositi of Palazzo degli Alberti, Prato (Tuscany). The attribution to Caravaggio is disputed.\r On June 25, 1605, Caravaggio wrote out, in his own hand, a contract to paint \"a picture of the same size and value as the one I have already done for him of Christ's crowning\", which restricts the Crowning to a period prior to this date. There is no firm evidence for a more precise dating, but the figure of Christ has been clearly influenced by the Christ in Rubens' altarpiece of The Crowning with Thorns in the Church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, Rome, completed in April 1602. The recipient of both the Crowning with Thorns and the Ecce Homo \u2014 the painting to which the contract relates \u2014 was Massimo Massimi, a wealthy financier and art collector in the circle of Caravaggio's patron, marquis Vincenzo Giustiniani. The actual date is disputed \u2014 John Gash places it in 1601\u20131603.\r Stylistically the painting is based on Rubens's altarpiece for the pose of Christ and on Titian's treatment of the same subject (now in the Louvre) for the soldier with the staff behind Christ. But Caravaggio has reverted to the compact, symmetrical approach employed by 15th-century artists, visible in, for example, the work of Hieronymous Bosch in Christ Mocked. The gestures which define the situation are restrained and understated\u2014the almost imperceptible actions of the tormentors focus attention on Christ, who looks up, his bound hands slightly raised almost in forgiveness.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Entombment of Christ\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/entombment\n\nWikipedia Article:\nCaravaggio created one of his most admired altarpieces, The Entombment of Christ, in 1603\u20131604 for the second chapel on the right in Santa Maria in Vallicella (the Chiesa Nuova), a church built for the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri. A copy of the painting is now in the chapel, and the original is in the Vatican Pinacoteca. The painting has been copied by artists as diverse as Rubens, Fragonard, G\u00e9ricault and C\u00e9zanne.\r On 11 July 1575, Pope Gregory XIII (1572-1585) issued a bull confirming the formation of a new society called the Oratory and granting it the church of Santa Maria in Vallicella. Two months after the bull, the rebuilding of the church commenced. Envisaged in the planned reconstruction of the Chiesa Nuova (new church), as it became known, was the dedication of all the altars to the mysteries of the Virgin. Starting in the left transept and continuing around the five chapels on either side of the nave to the right transept, the altars are dedicated to the Presentation of the Temple, the Annunciation, the Visitation, the Nativity, the Adoration of the Shepherds, the Circumcision, the Crucifixion, the Piet\u00e0, the Resurrection, the Ascension, the Descent of the Holy Ghost, the Assumption and the Coronation.\r The Entombment was probably planned and begun in 1602/3. The chapel in which the Entombment was to be hung, was dedicated to the Piet\u00e0, and was founded by Pietro Vittrice, a friend of Pope Gregory XIII and close follower of Filippo Neri. The Capella della Piet\u00e0 occupied a 'privileged' position in the Chiesa Nuova: Mass could be celebrated from it and it was granted special indulgences.\r The chapel, placed in the right nave of the Chiesa Nuova, was conceded to Vittrice in June 1577, and the foundation of the chapel ratified in September 1580. Some time after his death in March 1600, a legacy of 1,000 scudi became available for the maintenance of the chapel, and it was built in 1602, which is then held to be the earliest date for the commission of Caravaggio's painting. Indeed, on 1 September 1604, it is described as 'new' in a document recording that it had been paid for by Girolamo Vittrice, Pietro's nephew and heir.\r Girolamo Vittrice had a direct connection with Caravaggio: in August 1586 he married Orinzia di Lucio Orsi, the sister of Caravaggio's friend Prospero Orsi and the niece of the humanist Aurelio Orsi. Aurelio, in turn, was a one-time mentor to the young Maffeo Barberini, who became Pope Urban VIII in 1623. It is through these connections that Girolamo's son, Alessandro, became bishop of Alatri in 1632, and was able to bestow the gift of Caravaggio's Fortune Teller (now in the Louvre) on Pope Innocent X Pamphilij after being appointed governor of Rome in 1647.\r The painting was universally admired and written about by such critics as Giulio Mancini, Giovanni Baglione (1642), Gian Pietro Bellori (1672) and Francesco Scanelli (1657).\r The painting was taken to Paris in 1797 for the Mus\u00e9e Napol\u00e9on, returned to Rome and installed in the Vatican in 1816.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: The Death of the Virgin\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/the-death-of-the-virgin-1603\n\nWikipedia Article:\nDeath of the Virgin (1606) is a painting completed by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio. It is a near contemporary with Caravaggio's Madonna with Saint Anne now at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre.\r When he painted The Death of the Virgin (c. 1601-6), Caravaggio had been working in Rome for fifteen years. The painting was commissioned by Laerzio Cherubini, a papal lawyer, for his chapel in the Carmelite church of Santa Maria della Scala in Trastevere, Rome, the painting could not have been finished before 1605-1606. The depiction of the Death of the Virgin caused a contemporary stir, and was rejected as unfit by the parish.\r Giulio Mancini thought Caravaggio modelled a prostitute, possibly his mistress, as the Virgin. Giovanni Baglione and Gian Pietro Bellori attributed the rejection to the appearance of the Virgin. The breach of decorum led to a rejection of the painting by the fathers of Santa Maria della Scala and its replacement by a picture by Carlo Saraceni, a close follower of Caravaggio.\r Upon the recommendation by Peter Paul Rubens, who praised it as one of Caravaggio's best works, the painting was bought by Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua. Giovanni Magni, the duke's ambassador, briefly exhibited the painting in his house on the Via del Corso, between 1 and 7 April 1607. Copying was absolutely forbidden.\r The duke's collection was to be sold to Charles I of England in 1627. After his execution the English Commonwealth put his collection up for sale in 1649, and the painting was bought by Everhard Jabach, who in 1671 sold it to Louis XIV for the French Royal Collection, which after the French Revolution became the property of the state. Today it hangs in the Louvre. Prior to leaving Rome, it was shown at the Academy of Painters for under two weeks. However, by then, Caravaggio had fled Rome, never to publicly return. During one of his frequent brawls in Rome, the mercurial and impulsive Caravaggio killed a man, Ranuccio Tomassoni, during a sword fight after a tennis game.\r The painting recalls Caravaggio's Entombment in the Vatican in scope, sobriety, and the photographic naturalism. The figures are nearly life-sized. Mary lies reclined, clad in a simple red dress. The lolling head, the hanging arm, the swollen, spread feet depict a raw and realistic view of the Virgin's mortal remains. Caravaggio completely abandons the iconography traditionally used to indicate the holiness of the Virgin. In this cast-off body, nothing of the respectful representation found in devotional paintings remains.\r The composition is arranged around the Virgin, the painting's central theme. Surrounding the Virgin are overcome Mary Magdalen and apostles. Others shuffle in behind them. The compact mass of the assemblage and the posturing of the figures guide the viewer's eye toward the abandoned body. He expresses the greater grief of the former not by a more emotive face, but by hiding their faces. Caravaggio, master of stark and dark canvases, is not interested in a mannerist exercise that captures a range of emotions. In some ways this is a silent grief, this is no wake for wailers. The sobbing occurs in faceless emotional silence. The holiness of the Virgin is discerned by her thread-like halo. Suppressing all anecdotal detail, Caravaggio invests this subdued scene with extraordinary monumentality through the sole presence of these figures and the intensity of their emotions. The theatrical drape of blood-red cloth looms in the upper portion of the canvas; a common motif in deposition painting, here used to heighten the scene's dramatic effect.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Madonna of Loreto\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/madonna-of-loreto\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna of Loretto or Pilgrim's Madonna is a famous painting (1604\u20131606) by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio, located in the Cavalletti Chapel of the church of Sant'Agostino, near the Piazza Navona in Rome. It depicts the apparition of the barefoot Virgin and naked child to two peasants on a pilgrimage; or as some say it is the quickening of the iconic statue of the Virgin.\r In 1603 the heirs of marquis Ermete Cavalletti, who had died on 21 July 1602, commissioned for the decoration of a family chapel a painting on the theme of the Madonna of Loreto. Putting into practice the marquis's will, the Cavaletti's on 4 September 1603 purchased a chapel in the church of Sant'Agostino in Rome.\r Giovanni Baglione, a competing painter of lesser talent, but who had successfully obtained Caravaggio's jailing during a libel trial, said that the unveiling of this painting \"caused the common people to make a great cackle (schiamazzo) over it\". The uproar was not surprising. The Virgin Mary, like her admiring pilgrims, is barefoot. The doorway or niche is not an exalted cumulus or bevy of putti, but a partly decrepit wall of flaking brick is visible. Only the merest halo sanctifies her and the baby. While beautiful, the Virgin Mary could be any woman, emerging from the night shadows. Like many of Caravaggio's Roman paintings, such as the Conversion on the Way to Damascus or the Calling of St Matthew, the scene is a moment where everyday common man (or woman) encounters the divine, whose appearance is also not unlike that of a common man (or woman). The woman modelling Mary appears to be the same as that in the canvas in the Galleria Borghese: The Madonna and Child with St. Anne (Dei Palafrenieri) (1605).\r It has been suggested that Caravaggio's composition is at least in part derived from a detail of a 1574 engraving, Adoration of the Magi, after Rosso Fiorentino, by Caravaggio's friend Cherubino Alberti (1553-1615).\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Christ on the Mount of Olives\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/christ-on-the-mount-of-olives-1605\n\nWikipedia Article:\nChrist on the Mount of Olives (1604-1606) was a painting by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (Italian, 1571-1610), formerly in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum painting gallery, Berlin, but destroyed in 1945.\r The painting's authenticity has been disputed, but it is well attested in the collection of Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani and his brother Cardinal Benedetto Giustiniani, its dimensions being virtually identical with those of a Caravaggio of the same subject listed in the Giustiniani inventory. In addition the model for St Peter (the reclining figure) appears identical with the two St Jeromes from Caravaggio's Roman period, Saint Jerome in Meditation and Saint Jerome, both around 1605-1606.\r The subject is the episode related in the Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 26), when Jesus and his disciples went up to the Mount of Olives outside Jerusalem on the night when Christ was arrested; Jesus goes apart to pray, and returns to find the disciples sleeping. He awakens Peter with the rebuke, \"What, would none of you stay awake with me one hour? Stay awake, and pray that you may be spared the test, for the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" Judas then arrives with the Roman soldiers, and Christ's pointing finger seems to indicate their approach. The other two figures are St John (centre) and St James.\r Christ on the Mount of Olives forms part of a group of works on orthodox Christian subjects painted for Cardinal Benedetto, and including The Crowning with Thorns (Vienna), The Incredulity of Saint Thomas, and paintings of Saint Jerome, St Augustine and Mary Magdalene, now lost. At the same time as these works were being produced, Caravaggio was busy with Amor Victorious for the Cardinal's brother, the banker Vincenzo.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Ecce Homo\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/ecce-homo\n\nWikipedia Article:\nEcce Homo (c. 1605/6 or 1609 according to John Gash) is a painting by the Italian master Caravaggio. It is housed in the Palazzo Bianco, Genoa. According to Giambatista Cardi, nephew of the Florentine artist Cigoli, Cardinal Massimo Massimi commissioned paintings on the theme of Ecce Homo from three artists, Cigoli, Caravaggio, and Domenico Passignano, without informing the artists of the multiple commissions. Cardi claimed the cardinal liked Cigoli's version best.\r The scene is taken from the Gospel of (John 19): Pontius Pilate displays Christ to the crowd with the words, \"Ecce homo!\" (\"Behold the man\"). Caravaggio's version of the scene combined Pilate's display with the earlier moment of Christ, already crowned with thorns, mockingly robed like a king by his tormentors. Massimi already possessed a Crowning with Thorns, by Caravaggio, and Ecce Homo may have been intended as a companion piece. Stylistically, the painting displays characteristics of Caravaggio's mature Roman-period style. The forms are visible close-up and modelled by dramatic light, the absence of depth or background, and the psychological realism of, the torturer, who seems to mix sadism with pity. Pilate, in keeping with tradition, is shown as a rather neutral and perhaps almost sympathetic figure.\r The contract for Ecce Homo was signed on 25 June 1605, with the painting to be delivered in August. Whether Caravaggio met his deadline is uncertain, as by July he was arrested for attacking the house of Laura della Vecchia and her daughter, Isabella. Friends stood bail for him, but on 29 July he was in far more serious trouble for assaulting the notary Mariano Pasqualone over a well-known courtesan Lena and Caravaggio's model who is referred to by Pasqualone in the police complaint as \"Michelangelo's (i.e. Caravaggio's) girl\". Consequently, Caravaggio fled to Genoa until the end of August. He continued to be in trouble with the law throughout the year, with a complaint against him in September for throwing stones at his landlady's house, and a mysterious incident in October in which he was wounded in the throat and ear (Caravaggio claimed he had fallen on his own sword). In May 1606 he fled Rome again after killing Ranuccio Tomassoni in a duel, and he was not settled in Naples until the latter part of that year. Cigoli's Ecce Homo was not painted until 1607, and clearly attempts to mimic Caravaggio's style, suggesting that Massimi had not yet received his Caravaggio and was turning elsewhere. It is instructive to compare the two paintings: Caravaggio, unlike Cigoli, has dropped the convention of showing Christ's torturer as a grotesque, and has shown Pilate dressed as a 17th-century official.\r Several scholars, such as Sebastian Schutze dispute the attribution of this work to Caravaggio, with Schutze noting that \"the composition seems extremely cramped, and it's narrative structure strangely fractured. The Roman governor seems to belong to a quite different plane of reality; he appears like the donor figure in an altarpiece and is painted in a different manner, with his facial features exaggerated almost to the point of caricature.\"\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Saint Jerome Writing\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/saint-jerome-writing\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Jerome Writing, also called Saint Jerome in His Study or simply Saint Jerome, is an oil painting by Italian painter Caravaggio. Generally dated to 1605-1606, the painting is located in the Galleria Borghese in Rome.\r The painting depicts Saint Jerome, a Doctor of the Church in Roman Catholicism and a popular subject for painting, even for Caravaggio, who produced other paintings of Jerome in Meditation and engaged in writing. In this image, Jerome is reading intently, an outstretched arm resting with quill. It has been suggested that Jerome is depicted in the act of translating the Vulgate.\r The painting is generally dated to 1605-1606, largely on the statements of 17th-century art historical biographer Gian Pietro Bellori, though Denis Mahon suggests 1602-1604. According to Bellori, Caravaggio produced the piece at the behest of Cardinal Scipione Borghese, who became a cardinal in 1605, but it is possible that Borghese acquired it later as it is not mentioned in a 1613 poem by Scipione Francucci that described the Borghese Caravaggio collection. Whether or not the dating is accurate, the work is believed to have originated from Caravaggio's late Roman period, which ended with the painter's exile to Malta in 1606.\r That Saint Jerome Writing is the work of Caravaggio is sometimes brought into question, as it was attributed to Ribera in the Borghese inventories from 1700 until 1893.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Madonna and Child with St. Anne\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/madonna-and-child-with-st-anne-1606\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna and Child with St. Anne (Dei Palafrenieri) is one of the mature religious works of the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio, painted in 1605-1606, for the altar of Archconfraternity of the Papal Grooms (Italian: Arciconfraternita di Sant'Anna de Parafrenieri) in the Basilica of Saint Peter. The painting was briefly exhibited in the parish church for the Vatican, the church of Sant'Anna dei Palafrenieri on the Via di Porta Angelica in Borgo, near the Vatican, before its removal, presumably due to its unorthodox portrayal of the Virgin. It was subsequently sold to Cardinal Scipione Borghese, and now hangs in his palazzo (Galleria Borghese), where it shares space along with five other Caravaggios: Boy with a Basket of Fruit, David with the head of Goliath (attributed to 1606), Young Sick Bacchus, Saint Jerome Writing, and St John the Baptist in the Desert.\r While not his most successful arrangement, it is an atypical representation of the Virgin for its time, and must have been shocking to some contemporary viewers. The allegory, at its core, is simple. The Virgin with the aid of her son, whom she holds, tramples on a serpent, the emblem of evil or original sin. Saint Anne, whom the painting is intended to honor, is a wrinkled old grandmother, witnessing the event. Flimsy halos crown the upright; the snake recoils in anti-halos. Both Mary and Jesus are barefoot; Jesus is a fully naked uncircumcised child. All else is mainly shadow, and the figures gain monumentality in the light.\r If this painting was meant to honor the grandmother of Christ, it is unclear how the ungracious depiction of her wrinkled visage in this painting would have been seen as reverent or iconic. Further shock must have accrued, as stated by Bellori, at the Virgin Mary\u2019s revealing bodice. One could speculate that the parallel diagonals of Jesus\u2019 phallus and leg suggest that both battle the snake, with one its metaphorical equal.\r The model for the Virgin can also be found in Caravaggio\u2019s Madonna di Loreto. Contrast this tense scene with the famous, more peaceful arrangement of the family by Leonardo in his Virgin and Child with St. Anne.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Saint Francis in Meditation\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/saint-francis-in-meditation\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Francis in Meditation (c. 1604/06 or 1607/10), is a painting by the Italian master Caravaggio, in the Museo Civico, Cremona.\r This is one of two paintings of almost identical measurements showing Saint Francis of Assisi contemplating a skull (see Saint Francis in Prayer) - neither is documented and both are disputed, although the dispute is as to whether they are originals or copies. The dating of both is highly uncertain, although the cypress trunk behind this Saint Francis is very reminiscent of the tree behind the Corsini John the Baptist. St Francis was a popular subject during the Counter-Reformation, when the Church stressed - at least officially - the virtues of poverty and the imitation of Christ.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Supper at Emmaus\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/supper-at-emmaus-1606\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSupper at Emmaus (1606) is a painting by the Italian master Caravaggio, housed in the Pinacoteca di Brera (Sala XXIX), Milan.\r In the collection of Marchese Patrizi by 1624 and possibly commissioned by him, references by Caravaggio's early biographers Giulio Mancini and Giovanni Bellori suggest it was painted in the few months after May 1606 when the artist was in hiding on the estates of Prince Marzio Colonna following the death of Ranuccio Tomassoni (see main article, Caravaggio), although it may also have been painted in Rome earlier in the year - the innkeeper's wife seems to be the same as the model for Saint Anne in Madonna and Child with St. Anne of 1605, although given the almost complete echoing of pose and lighting, she may have been done from memory.\r The painting inevitably invites comparison with the National Gallery version of the same subject: the expansive theatrical guestures have become understated and natural, the shadows are darkened, and the colours muted although still saturated. The effect is to emphasise presence more than drama. Some details - the ear of the disciple on the right, the right hand of the innkeeper's wife - remain badly drawn, but there is a fluidity in the handling of the paint which was to increase in Caravaggio's post-Roman work as his brushwork became increasingly calligraphic. The artist may have had problems working out his composition - the innkeeper's wife looks like a last-minute addition. Neither she nor the innkeeper are mentioned in the Gospel of Luke 24:28-32, but had been introduced by Renaissance painters to act as a foil to the amazement of the two disciples as they recognise the resurrected Christ.\r From 5 June to 31 August 2013, Supper at Emmaus was exhibited in The Museum of Arts and Crafts in Zagreb, as a welcoming present of Italian government for Croatia's joining the EU on 1 June 2013. In March 2014, Supper at Emmaus is loaned to Hong Kong's The Asia Society for an exhibition called \"Light and Shadows - Caravaggio \u2022 The Italian Baroque Master\".

The painting shows the flagellation of Christ following his arrest and trial and before his crucifixion. The scene was traditionally depicted in front of a column, possibly alluding to the judgement hall of Pilate. The snub-nosed torturer on the far right is recognisably the same figure who modelled as one of the torturers in The Flagellation of Christ, and as the executioner in Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.\r The most famous treatment of the theme at the time was Sebastiano del Piombo's High Renaissance Flagellation of Christ in the church of San Pietro in Montorio in Rome. Piombo's Flagellation, much imitated by later artists, shows multiple idealised figures twisting through complex layers of space. Caravaggio has flattened the space, reduced the figures to a minimum, and used light to direct attention to the crucial parts of his composition - Christ's face and torso, the faces of the two torturers, and the hand holding the out-of-frame whip.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Crucifixion of Saint Andrew\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/crucifixion-of-saint-andrew-1607\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Crucifixion of Saint Andrew (1607) is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio. It is in the collection of the Cleveland Museum of Art, which acquired it from the Arnaiz collection in Madrid in 1976, having been taken to Spain by the Spanish Viceroy of Naples in 1610.\r The incident depicted, the martyrdom of Saint Andrew, was supposed to have taken place in Patras, Greece. The saint, bound to the cross with ropes, was said to have survived two days, preaching to the crowd and eventually converting them so that they demanded his release. When the Roman Proconsul Aegeas - depicted lower right - ordered him taken down, his men were struck by a miraculous paralysis, in answer to the saint's prayer that he be allowed to undergo martyrdom.\r From the 17th century Saint Andrew was shown on a diagonal cross, but Caravaggio would have been influenced by the 16th century belief that he was crucified on a normal Latin cross.\r On 11 July 1610 Juan Alonso Pimentel de Herrera, 5th Duke of Benavente, left Naples for Spain, having served as viceroy of that city for seven years. With him he a took a painting Giovanni Pietro Bellori described as \"la Crocifissione di Santo Andrea\". The painting was installed at the family palace in Valladolid, where it was appraised, in 1653, at 1,500 ducats, by far the highest value painting in the family collection. The occasion for the appraisal came with the death of the 7th Duke of Benavente in December 1652.\r The appraiser was Diego Valent\u00edn D\u00edaz who described the work as \"a large painting of a nude St Andrew when he is being put on the cross with three executioners and a woman, with an ebony frame\" and it is attributed to \"micael angel caraballo\". This painting was almost certainly commissioned by the viceroy, who was especially devoted to Saint Andrew and played a role in renovating the crypt of Saint Andrew in the Amalfi Cathedral.\r The Valladolid painting is thought to be the same as the present work, acquired by the Cleveland Museum of Art in 1976. There are three other versions of the composition: one (198 x 147.5\u00a0cm) formerly part of the Back-Vega collection, Vienna, and now part of the Spier Collection, London, attributed to Caravaggio between 1954 \u2013 1973 by some art historians such as Giuseppe Fiocco, Hermann Voss and Antonio Morassi, and considered a copy (by Louis Finson) by others, especially after the rediscovery of the version now in Cleveland in 1974. Since 2011, the former Back-Vega exemplar has again been attributed to Caravaggio, as a second version. The other two exemplars are undiscussed copies: one (232.5 x 160\u00a0cm) at the Museo Provincial de Santa Cruz, Toledo (Spain), discovered by Roberto Longhi in 1920, which was very ruined during the Spanish Civil War and whose author is uncertain; the other one (209 x1 51.5\u00a0cm) at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Dijon (France), long attributed to Abraham Vinck and considered to have been painted by Louis Finson since 2011.

It is dated to 1607, and may have been reworked by the artist in 1610. It is not to be confused with Christ at the Column, another Flagellation by Caravaggio of the same period.\r According to art biographer Gian Pietro Bellori (1672), this work was commissioned by the di Franco (or de Franchis) family for a chapel in the church of San Domenico Maggiore in Naples. The family were connected with the Confraternity of the Pio Monte della Misericordia, for whose church Caravaggio had already painted The Seven Works of Mercy. It was moved to the museum at Capodimonte in 1972.\r The Flagellation of Christ had long been a popular subject in religious art\u2014and in contemporary religious practice, where the church encouraged self-flagellation as a means by which the faithful might enter into the suffering of Christ. Caravaggio would have had in mind the famous fresco by Sebastiano del Piombo in the church of San Pietro in Montorio in Rome. Caravaggio has reworked Piombo's composition by drastically reducing the picture space so that the sculptural figures seem presented on a shallow stage. He has, however, retained Piombo's sense of the flagellation as a kind of sadistic ballet, with the figures arranged rhythmically across the canvas. Caravaggio's painting introduces an acutely observed reality into the scene: Christ is in this drooping pose, not because it might seem graceful, but because the torturer on the right is kicking the back of his knee while the figure on the left holds his hair tightly in his fist.\r This series of highly dramatic and innovative Neapolitan altarpieces \u2014 the Seven Works of Mercy, this Flagellation, and a close companion piece, Christ at the Column, all done within a few months of his arrival in the city \u2014 instantly made Caravaggio the most talked-about artist in Naples, and the church of Sant'Anna dei Lombardi (Saint Anna of the Lombards \u2014 Caravaggio was originally from Lombardy) became a centre of the Caravaggisti, artists painting in the style of Caravaggio. These were not only native Neapolitans like Carlo Sellitto and Battistello Caracciolo, but included Flemish artists like Louis Finson and Abraham Vink who would later help spread Caravaggism to northern Europe.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Madonna of the Rosary (Madonna del Rosario)\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/madonna-of-the-rosary-madonna-del-rosario-1607\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Madonna of the Rosary is a painting finished in 1607 by the Italian Baroque painter Caravaggio, now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. It is the only painting by Caravaggio that could be called a standard Baroque altarpiece.\r The commissioner of the work is uncertain. As altarpiece it would have been commissioned for a Dominican church, given the presence of Saint Dominic and Saint Peter Martyr of Verona. The donor is included in the painting; at the left, dressed in black with a ruff, seeking protection under the cloak of Saint Dominic and peering out at the viewer.\r According to some, the donor was Nicholas (or Nicholas) Radulovic, a rich merchant of Ragusa (now Dubrovnik in Croatia) and the first idea for the composition was a Madonna Enthroned with Saints Nicholas and Vito, then the subject was changed to reflect the wishes of the Dominicans. According to others, and perhaps more likely, it was made to decorate the family chapel in the Neapolitan church of San Domenico Maggiore, commissioned by Luigi Carafa-Colonna, relative of Martino Colonna, Overlord of Palestrina, Zagarolo and Paliano, where the painter had taken refuge after escaping from Rome. The large column to the left may be a reference to the Colonna family; it is linked to the big red drape that dominates the scene almost like a sail. The Feast of the Rosary was established in 1571 after the Battle of Lepanto, and Luigi Carafa-Colonna was a relative of Marcantonio Colonna, a leading admiral in the battle. Another possibility is Cesare d'Este, Duke of Modena.\r The Madonna is seated on a throne, and seems to give assent with a wave of the hand to Saint Dominic who is dressed in his usual habit and holding a rosary. The faithful turn to him for grace, kneeling, with a donor portrait at far left, of a man in black with a ruff. On the right is St Peter Martyr with a large scar on his forehead (just like Caravaggio who was wounded in the head a few months earlier in the scuffle with Ranuccio Tommasoni and still had a visible scar), which indicates the Virgin who is out of the picture. Behind him are other Dominicans.\r The painting was likely done between the 8th of January and mid-July 1607, that is between the completion of the Seven Works of Mercy and the departure of painter for Malta. Something must have gone wrong with the original commission as the painting was very soon on the market and bought by a Flemish consortium that included Rubens. After being offered to Vincenzo I Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, it was taken to Antwerp and offered to the Dominican church there. It is first mentioned in a letter by Frans Pourbus the Younger, a painter at the court of Mantua. On 15 September 1607 he wrote to his employer, Vincenzo I Gonzaga, the Duke of Mantua, that the painting was on the market in Naples for 400 ducats.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Saint Jerome Writing\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/saint-jerome-writing-1607\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Jerome Writing is a painting by the Italian master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio in 1607 or 1608, housed in the Oratory of St John's Co-Cathedral, Valletta, Malta. It can be compared with Caravaggio's earlier version of the same subject in the Borghese Gallery in Rome.\r Caravaggio arrived in Malta on 12 July 1607. He had spent the previous months in Naples, where he had sought refuge with his powerful protectors the Colonna family after killing a man in a brawl in Rome the previous year. In Naples he had been an instant success, achieving ten commissions, including a number or large and very prestigious altarpieces, in less than a year, and inspiring a following of Caravaggisti among the city's artists. In short, in Naples he had found professional success, the esteem of fellow-artists, and the support of important patrons. Why then leave all this for a speck of rock inhabited by warrior-monks noted more for their fighting (Peter Robb compares them to the French Foreign Legion) than for their support of the arts? The following summarises the speculation of recent biographers such as Robb and Helen Langdon: In 1607 Caravaggio was still an outlaw, at risk of being tracked down by his enemies - the family of the man he had killed - and Naples, close to Rome, may have seemed comparatively exposed. His patrons and protectors - the Colonna, the Giustiniani, the banker Ottavio Costa, - had strong links with Malta and the Knights, and it may have been felt that joining the Order would give Carvaggio immediate protection and aid in procuring a Papal pardon for his eventual return to Rome. The Grand Master of the Knights, Alof de Wignacourt, was keen to enhance the prestige of his Order and his capital, and the prospect of having one of the leading artists in Rome and Naples as de facto court painter must have been an appealing one. And so Caravaggio went to Malta.\r The coat of arms in the bottom right corner of the painting is that of Ippolito Malaspina, Prior of the Order of the Knights of Saint John (the Knights of Malta) in Naples. Malaspina was a relative by marriage of Caravaggio's patron Ottavio Costa, a friend of his other patrons the Giustiniani brothers, and a cousin of Giovanni Andrea Doria, Prince of Genoa, who two years before had sheltered the artist after an earlier flight from Rome. It's possible that he may have had himself represented as the saint. Saint Jerome was thus a very important painting for the artist.\r The subject seems oddly unmartial for a commission by a man whose raison d'etre was to fight the Turks - St Jerome was venerated as the translator of the Bible, which he is seen doing here. But Malaspina was not only a famous warrior, he was also a commissioner for the poor, orphans and widows, and the painting may have been intended to emphasise both this aspect of his work and also the asceticism of the Order.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Salome with the Head of John the Baptist\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/salome-with-the-head-of-john-the-baptist-1607-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSalome with the Head of John the Baptist (London), c. 1607/1610, is a painting by the Italian master Caravaggio in the National Gallery, London.\r The painting was discovered in a private collection in 1959. The early Caravaggio biographer Giovanni Bellori, writing in 1672, mentions a Salome with the Head of John the Baptist sent by the artist to the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta in the hope of regaining favour after having been expelled from the Order in 1608. It seems likely, however, that Bellori was referring to a different painting of the same subject (see Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid)). The handling and the raking light link this painting to works done in Naples during the artist's brief stay in the city during 1606\u20131607, an impression confirmed by the blances between Salome and the Virgin in the Madonna of the Rosary, and between the executioner holding the head of the Baptist and one of the two torturers in Christ at the Column and The Flagellation of Christ.

The painting depicts the seven corporal works of mercy in traditional Catholic belief, which are a set of compassionate acts concerning the material needs of others.\r The painting was made for, and is still housed in, the church of Pio Monte della Misericordia in Naples. Originally, it was meant to be seven separate panels around the church; however, Caravaggio combined all seven works of mercy in one composition which became the church's altarpiece. The painting is better seen from il \"coreto\" (little choir) in the first floor.\r The titular seven works/acts of mercy are represented in the painting as follows:\r American art historian John Spike notes that the angel at the center of Caravaggio\u2019s altarpiece transmits the grace that inspires humanity to be merciful.\r Spike also notes that the choice of Samson as an emblem of Giving Drink to the Thirsty is so peculiar as to demand some explanation. The fearsome scourge of the Philistines was a deeply flawed man who accomplished his heroic tasks through the grace of God. When Samson was in danger of dying of thirst, God gave him water to drink from the jawbone of an ass. It is difficult to square this miracle with an allegory of the Seven Acts of Mercy since it was not in fact the work of human charity.\r Regarding the sharp contrasts of the painting\u2019s chiaroscuro, the German art historian Ralf van B\u00fchren explains the bright light as a metaphor for mercy, which \"helps the audience to explore mercy in their own lives\".. Current scholarship has also established the connection between the iconography of \"The Seven Works of Mercy\" and the cultural, scientific and philosophical circles of the painting's commissioners..\r The Seven Works of Mercy was adapted for the theatre in 2016 by the Royal Shakespeare Company. Written by Anders Lustgarten, The Seven Acts of Mercy was directed by Erica Whyman, the Deputy Artistic Director at the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Annunciation\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/annunciation-1608\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Annunciation is an oil painting by the Italian master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, finished around 1608. It housed in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Nancy.\r The painting has been considerably damaged and retouched, and what remains of Caravaggio's brushwork is the angel, who bears a resemblance to the figure in John the Baptist at the Fountain. The illusionistic treatment of the angel, floating on his cloud and seeming to protrude outside the picture plane, is more Baroque than is normal for Caravaggio, but the contrast between the energetic pose of the heavenly messenger and the receptive Mary is dramatically and psychologically effective. The loose brushwork is typical of Caravaggio's later period.\r The painting was given by Henry II, Duke of Lorraine, to his primatial church in Nancy as the main altarpiece, and was perhaps acquired by one of the Duke's sons in the course of a visit to Malta in 1608.\r The painting is composed of two figures. The angel above the Virgin is attributed to being Gabriel who was the angel of the annunciation. The lilies that Gabriel holds are also a symbol of the Virgin.

According to Andrea Pomella in Caravaggio: An Artist through Images (2005), the work is widely considered to be Caravaggio's masterpiece as well as \"one of the most important works in Western painting.\" Jonathan Jones has described The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist as one of the ten greatest works of art of all time: \"Death and human cruelty are laid bare by this masterpiece, as its scale and shadow daunt and possess the mind.\"\r The painting, in oil on canvas, is 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) by 17\u00a0ft (5.2\u00a0m) and prominent are the vivid red and warm yellow colours, common to the Baroque period with the use of chiaroscuro. The image depicts the execution of John the Baptist while nearby Salome stands with a golden platter to receive his head. Another woman, who has been identified as Herodias or simply a bystander who realizes that the execution is wrong, stands by in shock while a jailer issues instructions and the executioner draws his dagger to finish the beheading. The scene, popular with Italian artists in general and with Caravaggio himself, is not directly inspired by the Bible, but rather by the tale as related in the Golden Legend.\r It is the only work by Caravaggio to bear the artist's signature, which he placed in red blood spilling from the Baptist's cut throat. There is considerable empty space in the image, but because the canvas is quite large the figures are approximately life-sized.\r Caravaggio drew the background for his work from his memories of his time in a prison of the Knights of Malta. Characteristically of his later paintings, the number of props and the detail in the props used is minimal.\r Completed in 1608 in Malta, the painting had been commissioned by the Knights of Malta as an altarpiece; it was the largest altarpiece which Caravaggio would ever paint. It still hangs in St. John's Co-Cathedral, for which it was commissioned and where Caravaggio himself was inducted and briefly served as a knight. Caravaggio's service to the Order was brief and troubled, however, as he was soon a fugitive from justice, having escaped while imprisoned for an unrecorded crime. When Caravaggio was defrocked in absentia as a \"foul and rotten member\" by the Order about six months after his induction, the ceremony took place in the Oratory, before this very painting.\r Caravaggio did several pieces depicting the moments after the event depicted here. One of these is on display in London's National Gallery; the other, in the Royal Palace of Madrid. It is believed that one of these may be the image that Caravaggio was said to have sent in an effort to appease Alof de Wignacourt, Grand Master of the Knights who expelled Caravaggio, but this is not certainly known.\r The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist has been badly damaged, though it did receive some restoration in the 1950s prior to a notable exhibition in Rome in 1955\u201356, which brought the work considerable attention. It was during the restoration that Caravaggio's signature in the blood became visible to modern viewers. The signature is a matter of some dispute. The work is signed f. Michelang.o (the f to indicate his brotherhood in the order), but it is popularly claimed that Caravaggio signed \"I, Caravaggio, did this\" in confession of some crime\u2014perhaps connected to the 1606 death of Ranuccio Tomassoni at Caravaggio's hands, which had caused the painter to flee Rome.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Burial of Saint Lucy\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/burial-of-saint-lucy-1608\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBurial of Saint Lucy is a painting by the Italian artist Caravaggio. It is located in the church of Santa Lucia alla Badia located on the Piazza Duomo in Syracuse, Sicily.\r According to The Golden Legend, Saint Lucy had bestowed her wealth on the poor, in gratitude for the miraculous healing of her mother. Denounced as a Christian, she refused to recant, offered her chastity to Christ, and was sentenced to be dragged to a brothel. Miraculously, nothing could move her from the spot where she stood. She was pierced by a knife in the throat and, where she fell, the church of Santa Lucia al Sepolcro in Syracuse was built.\r Caravaggio had escaped from prison on Malta in 1608, fleeing to Syracuse. There his Roman companion Mario Minniti helped him get a commission for the present altarpiece. Caravaggio painted it in 1608, for the Franciscan church of Santa Lucia al Sepolcro. The choice of subject was driven by the fact that St. Lucy was the patron saint of Syracuse and had been interred below the church. The subject was unusual, but especially important to the local authorities, who were eager to reinforce the local cult of St. Lucy, which had sustained a setback with the theft of her remains during the Middle Ages.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Fra Antionio Martelli\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/portrait-of-fra-antionio-martelli-1608\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Fra Antonio Martelli (c. 1607/1608) is a painting by the Italian master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence.\r Until recently it was thought that this painting represented Alof de Wignacourt, Grand Master of the Order of the Knights of Malta, and that it was a preparatory study for the large and famous Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt and his Page, but recent documentary discoveries indicate that it is the portrait of another prominent member of the Order, Antonio Martelli of Florence, Prior of Messina.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Sleeping Cupid\nArtwork Genre: mythological painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/sleeping-cupid-1608\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSleeping Cupid is a painting by the Italian master Caravaggio.\r Unlike many of Caravaggio's works, it can be dated accurately.

He was elected Grand Master in 1601, determined to enhance the prestige of the Order and its new post-siege capital, Valletta. It was not surprising, therefore, that he would welcome the opportunity to have at his court the most famous painter in Rome and Naples, Michelangelo da Caravaggio.\r Caravaggio arrived in Malta from Naples in July 1607 and according to his early biographers Giovanni Baglione and Giovanni Bellori, he began at once with portraits of Wignacourt and other knights from the highest ranks of the Order. This famous portrait shows the Grand Master in formal armour, holding his baton of command, every gleaming inch an image of the military might of the Knights. At the time Wignacourt was about sixty years old. He had strengthened the fortifications of the island, built an aqueduct to guarantee water to the city, and launched several attacks on the Turks. He had turned the Knights into a sovereign power, making himself in effect a prince answerable to no-one except the Pope, with his own increasingly wealthy court.\r One of his innovations had been to surround to himself with young pages, in imitation of the fashion of the princely courts. The pages were taken from the most noble Catholic families of Europe. According to John Gash and others the page in the portrait is probably Nicholas de Paris Boissy, a French aristocrat destined for a distinguished career \u2013 he became Grand Prior of France in 1657. He is placed a little awkwardly within the composition: his feet are aligned with the feet of de Wignacourt, as if standing beside de Wignacourt, but his hand and the helmet overlap Wignacourt's elbow, giving the impression that from the waist up he is in front of the knight. The fact can be explained by Caravaggio's practice of painting separately from live models \u2013 de Wignacourt and the page were apparently not together in the studio at the same time.\r The boy's lively expression and alert gaze make him an attractive subject in his own right, to the extent that he was several times copied by later artists visiting Malta. Wignacourt, encased in splendid black and gold Milanese armour, stares upwards and outwards out of the frame in a dignified manner that invites the viewer to gaze upon him in awe, leaving the page, with his look of boyish interest, as the sole thoroughly human presence, and a far more sympathetic one than the self-conscious man of steel. The double-portrait with the pageboy was an unusual combination for the time. It may have been ordered by Wignacourt to stress the dignity of his court, or Caravaggio may have been inspired by a painting by Titian that he could have seen in his youth in Milan, Alfonso d'Avalos Addressing his Troops, showing the Spanish governor of the city addressing his knights with a page beside him holding his helmet.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Adoration of the Shepherds\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/adoration-of-the-shepherds-1609\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Adoration of the Shepherds is an oil on canvas painting by the Italian artist Michelangelo Merisi, commonly known as Caravaggio. The Adoration of the Shepherds measures 83.07 x 123.62 in. It was commissioned for the Capuchin Franciscans and was painted in Messina for the Church of Santa Maria degli Angeli in 1609 just one year prior to the death of Caravaggio.\r Michelangelo Merisi, commonly known as Caravaggio, was born in Milan in the northern region of Lombardy, Italy in 1571. He had to flee from his hometown after wounding a police officer in a tavern brawl. As with most other aspiring artists, he went to Rome to study classical techniques. Throughout his young adult life, Caravaggio was known amongst Italian citizens to be quite unruly and rebellious. He was often arrested on charges for violent behavior.\r Cardinal Francesco del Monte took a struggling Caravaggio into his home, and introduced him to his circle\u2014thereby securing Caravaggio with his first public commissions. These commissions were not religious, but entirely secular paintings ranging from flowers and fruit to paintings of a young classical Greek god. It was during this time that he would become world-renowned for the physical particularity and brutal realism of his paintings. In 1599, Caravaggio reached a turning point in his artistic career.\r Presumably under Cardinal Francesco de Monte, Caravaggio was commissioned to decorate a wall dedicated to Saint Matthew in the Contarelli Chapel in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi. This was Caravaggio\u2019s first religious work for the Catholic Church. He began to be seen as an artistic visionary for the Church with his use of anachronistic technique to draw people back to the Catholic Church during the Counter Reformation. With this good publicity, he began to pick up many more prestigious commissions. Caravaggio painted from life rather than drawings, which initially received criticism but later revolutionized the term \u201cartistic realism\u201d.\r Caravaggio mysteriously died in 1610, a year after finishing The Adoration of the Shepherds. \r By the time that Caravaggio painted The Adoration of the Shepherds in 1609, the subjects in his paintings had acquired a more spiritual expressiveness. His figures were isolated against vast, empty backgrounds. This was a contrast to the Renaissance technique of employing decorative backgrounds.\r The Capuchins were among the few religious patrons and critics who were fond of Caravaggio\u2019s brutal realism. Many were critical of Caravaggio\u2019s approach to his religious paintings and called it \u201cvulgar\u201d to represent biblical figures as ordinary peasants. The focal point of the scene is Mary in the center. She is swathed in bright red. One of the three shepherds closest to her also has a little bit of what appears to be the same red robe draped along his arm. This might be symbolic of the gesture he is making to touch the Virgin as she is holding Christ. All three shepherds, as well as Joseph identified by a faint halo, look on with amazement and complete adoration at this infant child born in a barn.\r Caravaggio\u2019s Baroque work is starkly different and revolutionary from Renaissance predecessors. To start, these divine figures are represented as ordinary people of the times. They are barefoot with ordinary robes. There is no divinity in the barn, either. There is no holy light source to shine the entire scene and make it overly-apparent that a divine event is occurring. Instead, the background is extremely dark with only a small single light source. It seems as though the space was lit by a single candle, as it might have realistically been during the actual event. We know that in the biblical account, Mary and Joseph were extremely poor. Their halos are almost barely seen, in contrast to the ornate halos of the Renaissance. Other than the halos, the clasped hands of the shepherds is the only thing hinting of any religious importance in the painting. There was nothing overtly marvelous about the birth of Christ. Caravaggio renders this aspect perfectly.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Resurrection of Lazarus\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/resurrection-of-lazarus-1609\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Raising of Lazarus, c. 1609, in the Museo Regionale, Messina, is a painting by the Italian artist Caravaggio (1571\u20131610).\r In August 1608 Caravaggio fled from Malta, where he had been imprisoned for an unknown crime, and took refuge in Sicily with his friend, the artist Mario Minniti. Through Minniti's intercession he procured a number of important commissions, including this for the church of the Padri Crociferi in Messina, where it was presented by the wealthy Genoese merchant Giovanni Battista de' Lazzari on 10 June 1609. The fee was a thousand scudi, more than double any Caravaggio had received previously.\r Lazarus, the brother of Martha and Mary, was the patron saint of Giovanni Battista de' Lazzari, to whom Caravaggio was contracted to paint an altarpiece in the church of the Padri Crociferi. The Gospel of John tells how he fell sick, died, was buried and then miraculously raised from the dead by Christ. As in several paintings from this period of Caravaggio's career, the scene is set against blank walls that overwhelm the frieze of human actors. The interaction of the relief of figures caught in corporate effort and emotion, with a large void above, is quite different from the closely focussed individualised dramas of his early and middle periods. As is usual with Caravaggio, light becomes an important element in the drama, picking out crucial details such as Lazarus's hands\u2014one lax and open to receive, the other reaching towards Christ\u2014and the wonder-struck faces of the onlookers.\r The old story that Caravaggio had a freshly buried body exhumed for this painting is \"probably apocryphal, but not beyond the bounds of possibility\" (John Gash, see below). Some of the figures were said to be modelled on members of the community, but Caravaggio has also relied on his memory\u2014the whole design is based on an engraving after Giulio Romano and his Jesus is a reversed image of the Christ who called Matthew to join him in The Calling of Saint Matthew. The painting is in poor condition and much restored, and it's possible that some passages are the work of assistants.\r According to Francesco Susinno, Caravaggio had produced a first version that he destroyed with a razor after adverse criticism. Subsequently he would have finished in record time the present version, but probably this account is fanciful.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/nativity-with-st-francis-and-st-lawrence-1609\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence (also known as The Adoration) is a painting believed to have been created in 1609 by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio. Recent discoveries link the painting to that commissioned by Fabio Nuti in April 1600, and thus sent from Rome to Palermo.\r It was stolen on October 18, 1969 from the Oratorio di San Lorenzo in Palermo, Sicily.\r The painting, which hung above the altar, was large, measuring almost six square metres (actual size 268\u00a0cm x 197\u00a0cm). Probably because of its size, it was removed from its frame by the thief or thieves (two suspected) before being taken out of the church. After it was stolen, the Oratory was pillaged of other art, along with choir stalls of carved and gilded wood and benches inlaid with precious woods and mother of pearl.\r The local Sicilian Mafia are generally considered to be the prime culprits in the theft although nobody actually knows who committed the crime. The whereabouts of the work remain unknown to this day. Rumours of its destruction during the theft, or subsequently in the 1980 Irpinia earthquake, have circulated from time to time as has the notion that the masterpiece is now hidden abroad. In 1996, Francesco Marino Mannoia, an informant and former member of the Sicilian Mafia, claimed he had stolen the painting as a young man on the orders of a high-ranking mobster, but other sources say it was stolen by amateurs and then sold on to various Mafiosi; at one point it is said to have ended up in the hands of Rosario Riccobono, who was killed in 1982, after which it passed on to Gerlando Alberti. In 2009, Gaspare Spatuzza, a former Mafia figure turned police informer, claimed that he was told in 1999 that the painting was stolen for a private collector but had been destroyed by rats and pigs while hidden in a farm outbuilding and the remains burned.\r The Nativity is one of the most famous unrecovered stolen works of art; its theft is on the FBI's top ten list of art crimes. The value, if the work was ever sold, is estimated to be $20 million; though resale value on the black market, especially for an infamous work of art, is nowhere near the actual value. On the black market, stolen art fetches perhaps a tenth of its estimated value if it can even be sold at all.\r In 2016, a reproduction of the painting was produced by Factum Arte for a documentary on the painting and its theft. This reproduction was then permanently installed in the chapel, in the place of the original.\r  Media related to Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence by Caravaggio at Wikimedia Commons\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Salome with the Head of John the Baptist\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/salome-with-the-head-of-john-the-baptist-1609\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSalome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid), c. 1609, is a painting by the Italian master Caravaggio in the Palacio Real, Madrid.\r The early Caravaggio biographer Giovanni Bellori, writing in 1672, records the artist sending a Salome with the Head of John the Baptist from Naples to the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, Fra Alof de Wignacourt, in the hope of regaining favour after having been expelled from the Order in 1608. It seems likely that this is the work, according to Caravaggio scholar John Gash. Gash also notes that the executioner, looking down at the severed head, helps transform the painting \"from a provocative spectacle into a profound meditation on death and human malevolence.\"\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: David with the Head of Goliath\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/david-with-the-head-of-goliath-1610\n\nWikipedia Article:\nDavid with the Head of Goliath is a painting by the Italian Baroque artist Caravaggio. It is housed in the Galleria Borghese, Rome. The painting, which was in the collection of Cardinal Scipione Borghese in 1650, has been dated as early as 1605 and as late as 1609\u20131610, with more recent scholars tending towards the former.\r Caravaggio also treated this subject in a work dated c.1607, currently in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, and in an early work dated c. 1600 in the Prado in Madrid.\r The immediate inspiration for Caravaggio was a work by a follower of Giorgione, c.1510, but Caravaggio captures the drama more effectively by having the head dangling from David's hand and dripping blood, rather than resting on a ledge. The sword in David's hand carries an abbreviated inscription H-AS OS; this has been interpreted as an abbreviation of the Latin phrase humilitas occidit superbiam (\"humility kills pride\").\r David is perturbed, \"his expression mingling sadness and compassion.\" The decision to depict him as pensive rather than jubilant creates an unusual psychological bond between him and Goliath. This bond is further complicated by the fact that Caravaggio has depicted himself as Goliath, while the model for David is il suo Caravaggino (\"his own little Caravaggio\"). This most plausibly refers to Cecco del Caravaggio, the artist's studio assistant in Rome some years previously, recorded as the boy \"who lay with him.\" No independent portraits of Cecco are known, making the identification impossible to verify, but \"[a] sexual intimacy between David/model and Goliath/painter seems an inescapable conclusion, however, given that Caravaggio made David's sword appear to project upward, suggestively, between his legs and at an angle that echoes the diagonal linking of the protagonist's gaze to his victim.\" Alternatively, based on the portrait of Caravaggio done by Ottavio Leoni, this may be a double self-portrait. The young Caravaggio (his own little Caravaggio) wistfully holds the head of the adult Caravaggio. The wild and riotous behavior of the young Caravaggio essentially had destroyed his life as a mature adult, and he reflects with a familiar hermeticism on his own condition in a painting of a related religious subject.\r The biographical interest of the painting adds another layer of meaning to an already complex work, David and Goliath standing for Christ and Satan and the triumph of good over evil in orthodox Christian iconography of the period, and also as the cold-hearted beloved who \"kills\" and his lover according to contemporary literary conceit. An example of the genre can be seen in the contemporary Judith and Holofernes of Cristofano Allori in the Pitti Palace, where Allori depicts himself as Holofernes, although Caravaggio has depicted David not as cruel and indifferent but as deeply moved by Goliath's death.\r If the painting was a gift to Cardinal Borghese, the papal official with the power to grant Caravaggio a pardon for murder, it can also be interpreted as a personal plea for mercy. \"David with the Head of Goliath [thus] demonstrates Caravaggio's gift for distilling his own experiences into an original sacred imagery that transcends the personal to become a searing statement of the human condition.\"\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Denial of Saint Peter\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/denial-of-saint-peter-1610\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Denial of Saint Peter (La Negazione di Pietro) is a painting finished around 1610 by the Italian painter Caravaggio. It depicts Peter denying Jesus after Jesus was arrested. The painting is housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\r The Denial of Saint Peter is generally thought to be one of the last two works by Caravaggio, the other being The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula. It was probably finished at Naples in the summer of 1610. This dating is made on stylistic and compositional grounds, especially by comparison to the Saint Ursula.\r In 1612, the painter Guido Reni left Rome for his native Bologna and on 8 March 1612 gave instructions to the engraver Luca Ciamberlano to collect the remainder of his fees from Reverenda Camera Apostolica for the frescos he had painted in the Borghese Chapel in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. Ciamberlano again acted on his behalf on 12 September 1612 in the collection of some other debts. The combined sum owed to Reni amounted to 350 scudi. It seems that Ciamberlano was late in the forwarding of this money, for on 3 May 1613 Reni appointed Alessandro Albini to collect. Summoned before the notary Simon Petrus Corallus, Ciamberlano offered \"a painting by the hand of the late master Michelangelo da Caravaggio, which they say portrays the denial of St Peter with a maid.\" It was valued highly at 240 scudi and accepted by Albini in payment. The balance, 110 scudi, was paid over the next seven years.\r A number of artists active in Rome about this time must have known of the painting. Its influence is to be seen in a work by Jos\u00e9 de Ribera, now in the Galleria Corsini, Rome, dated to ca. 1613\u201315. Lionello Spada also completed at least two autograph works based on the painting, one in a private collection, the other in the Galleria Nazionale, Parma. Spada returned to Bologna from Rome and Malta in 1614.\r Reni must have disposed of the painting some time within the next decade since it appears in Cardinal Paolo Savelli's inventory taken at the Ariccia palace in 1624. Savelli was a patron of Orazio Gentileschi, a contemporary of Caravaggio in Rome, of whom he owned at least twelve paintings.\r The cardinal died in 1632, leaving it to his brother, Federico Savelli (died 1649), who in his turn left it to his nephew Cardinal Fabrizio Savelli. In 1650 the Savelli collection was offered for sale to the Duke of Modena and the picture must have been sold soon thereafter.\r In 1798, Matthew Pilkington noted a painting in the Certosa di San Martino in Naples \"by Caravaggio, representing the Denial of St. Peter, with figures at half-length and as large as life\". A document of 28 September 1655 states it was sold to the Certosa by architect Cosimo Fanzago and was hung above the door to the sacristy. Bernardo de' Dominici described this painting in the third volume of his Vite dei Pittori, Scultori, ed Architetti Napolitani (1742) as \"a miracle of art, executed with such power of truth that it triumphs over whatever work is near it\". Battistello Caracciolo had made a copy of this painting, now lost. It is not known whether this painting is the same as the present; some time after Bernardo de' Dominici remarked on it, it was removed and presumably sold. Giovanni Pietro Bellori (1672) wrote \"it depicts the serving maid pointing to Peter, who turns with open hands in the act of denying Christ; and it is painted in nocturnal light with other figures warming themselves at a fire \". Thus there appears to be a second version of Caravaggio's Denial of St Peter unaccounted for.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Martyrdom of Saint Ursula\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/martyrdom-of-saint-ursula-1610\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Martyrdom of Saint Ursula (1610), is a painting by the Italian artist Caravaggio (1571\u20131610) and thought to be his last picture. It is in the Intesa Sanpaolo Collection, the Gallery of Palazzo Zevallos Stigliano, Naples.\r According to one version of the legend of Saint Ursula, she and her eleven thousand virgin companions, were captured by the Huns. The eleven thousand virgins were slaughtered, but the king of the Huns was overcome by Ursula's modesty and beauty and begged her forgiveness if only she would marry him. Ursula replied that she would not, upon which the king transfixed her with an arrow.\r Caravaggio painted Saint Ursula in 1610 in Naples for Marcantonio Doria, a 25-year-old nobleman from Genoa. Doria had become an ardent collector of Caravaggio's work, and he commissioned the painting to mark the entry of his stepdaughter into a religious order as Sister Ursula. The date of the painting can be located at shortly prior to 11 May 1610,  when Doria's procurator in Naples, Lanfranco Massa, wrote to his master that the painting was finished. There had been a slight accident, the agent wrote, when he had tried to hasten the drying by leaving it out in the sun the day before, softening the varnish. The agent told Doria not to worry as he would take it back to Caravaggio to be fixed and, in fact, Doria should commission more works from the artist as \"people are fighting over him and this is a good chance.\" However, this may be a reference to another artist Marcantonio had also commissioned work from. The original source document is unclear. Tha painting was received in Genoa on 18 June and Doria was delighted, placing it with his Raphaels and Leonardos and his vial of the authentic blood of John the Baptist.\r In his will of 19 October 1651, Marcantonio left his art collection to his eldest son Nicol\u00f2, Prince of Angri and Duke of Eboli. The estate was transferred to Naples by Maria Doria Cattaneo in 1832. The painting is listed in the inventory of Giovan Carlo Doria's inheritance, taken in 1854-55, in the Palazzo Doria d'Angri allo Spirito Santo, Naples.\r Caravaggio had arrived in Naples from Sicily in September or October 1609. Within days he was attacked outside a restaurant by four armed men, leading to rumours that he had been killed or facially disfigured. It is probable that he took a long time to convalesce, and it is difficult to link more than a handful of works, and most of them hesitantly, to this second stay in the city. The Saint Ursula, however, can be positively identified. It marks yet another change in style: in Sicily he had continued the compositional scheme introduced with The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist, a small group of figures dwarfed by massive architecture, but Ursula marks a return to a scene which brings the action directly into the space of the viewer, at the very moment when the Hun king lets fly his arrow, and Ursula looks down with an expression of mild surprise at the shaft sticking out of her chest. To the right and rear a few onlookers stare in shock, one of them, the upturned face behind Ursula, apparently Caravaggio himself. Everyone who had seen the painting had been stunned, Doria's agent reported. Doria himself might have been glad to see his favourite artist, unmarked despite all the rumours.\n", "\nArtist: Caravaggio\nArtwork Name: Saint Francis in Prayer\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/saint-francis-in-prayer\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Francis in Prayer (c. 1602-1604) is a painting from the Italian master Caravaggio, in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica in Rome.\r The painting is unrecorded and therefore difficult to date, or even to distinguish the original from later copies. John Gash (see references, below) identifies a version in the Chiesa dei Cappuccini as a good copy of a lost original identified by some scholars with a painting in the Church of San Pietro, Carpineto Romano (Museo di Palazzo Venezia). Helen Langdon, treating the same painting in her biography Caravaggio, refers to the version in Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, in the Palazzo Barberini. St Francis's life of poverty and humility was a popular subject in Caravaggio's age. Peter Robb makes the point that St Francis of Assisi, together with John the Baptist and St Jerome, \"...make up the trio of alienated males, young, mature and old, brooding and remote from human society, that M (i.e. Caravaggio) painted again and again\", becoming, in effect, private icons for Caravaggio\u2019s own troubled life.\r In the course of a libel trial in 1603 Caravaggio\u2019s friend Orazio Gentileschi stated that he had lent the artist a monk's robe several months before, and this painting could be connected. Gentileschi\u2019s evidence seems to be the main argument behind a 1602/1604 date; but Robb, on the grounds of the austere approach and less painterly technique of the work, believes that it may date from 1606, when Caravaggio had fled Rome as an outlaw following a death in a street brawl.\n", "\nArtist: Guido Reni\nArtwork Name: Massacre of the Innocents\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/guido-reni/massacre-of-the-innocents-1611\n\nWikipedia Article:\nMassacre of the Innocents is a painting by the Italian Baroque painter Guido Reni, created in 1611 for the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna, but now in the Pinacoteca Nazionale in that same city.\r The painting is based on the biblical episode of the Massacre of the Innocents, described in the Gospel of Matthew.

The phrase appears for the first time in art and architecture in this work. The iconography of the memento mori theme symbolised in art by the skull was rather popular in Rome and Venice since Renaissance times.\r Elias L. Rivers suggested the phrase \"Et In Arcadia Ego\" is derived from a line from Daphnis' funeral in Virgil's Fifth Eclogue Daphnis ego in silvis (\"Daphnis was I amid the woods\"), and that it referred to the dead shepherd within the tomb, rather than Death itself.\r Mentioned for the first time in the collection of Antonio Barberini in 1644, the painting was later acquired by Colonna of Sciarra (1812), being attributed to Bartolomeo Schedoni until 1911. Nicolas Poussin also made two paintings on the topic of Et in Arcadia Ego, less than two decades later.\r The painting is connected with Guercino's Flaying of Marsyas by Apollo in Palazzo Pitti (1618), where the same group of shepherds is present.\r Goethe's Italian Journey (1816) has \"Et In Arcadia Ego\" as its motto. Goethe viewed Guercino's painting in Cento (17 October 1786).\r Hans Christian Andersen's \"Improvisatoren\" (1835) in chapter 13 two of the main characters discuss the painting.\n", "\nArtist: Gian Lorenzo Bernini\nArtwork Name: The Rape of Proserpina\nArtwork Genre: sculpture\nArtwork Media: marble\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gian-lorenzo-bernini/rape-of-proserpine-1622\n\nWikipedia Article:\n  The Rape of Proserpina (Italian: Ratto di Proserpina) is a large Baroque marble sculptural group by Italian artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini, executed between 1621 and 1622. Bernini was only 23 years old at its completion. It depicts the abduction of Proserpina, who is seized and taken to the underworld by the god Pluto. The word \"Rape\" is the traditional translation of the Latin raptus, \"seized\" or \"carried off\", and does not refer specifically to sexual violence.  As with many of Bernini's early works, it was commissioned by Cardinal Scipione Borghese, possibly alongside a portrait of Scipione's uncle Pope Paul V (who had died in 1621). Bernini received at least three payments for the statue, of value of at least 450 Roman scudi. The sculpture was begun in 1621 and completed in 1622. Quite soon after its completion, the statue was given by Scipione to Cardinal Ludovisi in 1622, who transported it to his villa. Purchased by the Italian State, it returned to the Villa Borghese in 1908.  Most critics have been quick to praise the work. Rudolf Wittkower noted: \"representations of such rape scenes depended on Bernini's new, dynamic conception for the next hundred and fifty years\". Howard Hibbard makes similar comments noting the realistic effects that Bernini had achieved via carving hard marble, such as the \"texture of the skin, the flying ropes of hair, the tears of Persephone and above all the yielding flesh of the girl\". The choice of incident to depict the story is commonly cited as well: Pluto's hands encircle the waist of Proserpina just as she throws her arms out in an attempt to escape. Bernini's own son and biographer, Domenico, called it \"an amazing contrast of tenderness and cruelty\".   However, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when Bernini's reputation was at a low ebb, critics found fault with the statue. The eighteenth-century French visitor Jerome de la Lande allegedly wrote: \"Pluto's back is broken; his figure extravagant, without character, nobleness of expression, and its outline bad; the female one no better\". Another French visitor to the Villa Ludovisi was equally critical, stating: \"The head of Pluto is vulgarly gay; his crown and beard give him a ridiculous air, while the muscles are strongly marked and the figure poses. It is not a true divinity, but a decorative god...\"  Others have remarked on the twisted contrapposto or figura serpentinata pose of the group. While reminiscent of Mannerism, particularly Giambologna's The Rape of the Sabine Women, Bernini permits the viewer to absorb the scene from one single viewpoint. While other views provide further details, a spectator can see the desperation of Proserpina and the lumbering attempts of Pluto to grab her. This was in contrast to the Mannerist sculpture of Giambologna, which required the spectator to walk around the sculpture to gain a view of each of character's expression.  During the First World War, the sculpture was protected by a box and sandbags to prevent damage.\n", "\nArtist: Giovanni Paolo Panini\nArtwork Name: Roman Capriccio: The Pantheon and Other Monuments\nArtwork Genre: veduta\nArtwork Media: oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/giovanni-paolo-panini/roman-capriccio-the-pantheon-and-other-monuments-1735\n\nWikipedia Article:\nRoman Capriccio: The Pantheon and Other Monuments is a 1735 oil painting by Italian artist Giovanni Paolo Panini, located in the Indianapolis Museum of Art, which is in Indianapolis, Indiana. It depicts an array of famous Roman monuments in a rural setting.\r Panini was a famed painter of capriccios, architectural fantasies. In this case, he combined a staggering array of monuments by Romans without regard to topography. From left to right, he included the Temple of Hadrian, the Pantheon, the Temple of Vesta, the Maison Carr\u00e9e, and the Theater of Marcellus, all of them surrounding the Obelisk of Thutmose III. In front of this overabundance of history, he placed the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, around which contemporary Roman peasants carry out their business.\r While quite cavalier with regards to geography, Panini was remarkably faithful in his architectural reconstructions. He carefully edited out later additions to the original buildings, such as the walled-in sections in the arches of the Theater of Marcellus and Bernini's bell towers on the Pantheon's pediment.\r Panini's earliest training was with a painter of theatrical scenery, and certain elements of that early influence can be seen in this painting. The arrangement of monuments is very similar to the way architectural perspective was achieved in the Italian theater. At the front of the \"stage\" are the peasant-actors in quaint costumes.\r Fashionable European youths undertook the Grand Tour throughout the eighteenth century, and for half a century to either side, and liked to bring back souvenirs of their travels. Thus, sketches and paintings of landmarks such as those in the Capriccio were very lucrative for Panini and his contemporaries. Escapism and contemplation were more important than geographical accuracy, so Panini was free to rearrange scenery in paintings like this. This creative reorganization led to a better comprehension of the ideal, rather than current, conditions of the monuments and the civilization that made them.\r The IMA received Roman Capriccio: The Pantheon and Other Monuments and its pendant, The Colosseum and Other Monuments in 1950, as gifts of Lila Allison Lilly in memory of her husband, Josiah Kirby Lilly. Both are currently on view in the Jane H. Fortune Gallery.

It depicts the Virgin Mary, surrounded by angels and crowned with the circle of stars. She is shown trampling a snake, representing her victory over the devil. The lilies and the rose are references to hortus conclusus (\"enclosed garden\"), and symbolize Mary's love, virginity and purity.\r The painting was one of seven altarpieces commissioned in March 1767 from Tiepolo by King Charles III of Spain for the Church of Saint Pascual in Aranjuez, then under construction. This was originally an Alcantarine (Franciscan) monastery that was later assigned to the Conceptionist nuns. Both orders promoted the cult of the Immaculate Conception. The painting is now in the Prado Museum, Madrid.\r Baroque art was meant to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. Tiepolo's works, many of which are on an imposing scale, are also characterized by tension, exuberance, hedonism and intricate designs. Among Tiepolo's most popular works are mythological and religious themes conveying an atmosphere of grandeur and beauty.\r Tiepolo's altarpieces were transferred to the adjoining convent soon after they were installed in the church. They were replaced by an identically themed set by Anton Raphael Mengs, whose neo-classicism was more to Charles III's taste. Finally The Immaculate Conception was transferred to the Prado Museum in 1827.\r The imposing Baroque style of the painting is meant to evoke emotion. It was completed between 1767 and 1768. The depiction of the Virgin Mary is done according to traditional Christian iconography, and represents her Immaculate Conception, free from original sin. Standard iconographic elements include the dove above her, the stars around her head, her position on the crescent moon with a snake crushed under her feet, her hands held together in prayer, and the obelisk on her right.\r Additional iconography which accords to this theme include clouds, cherubs, lilies and a pink rose, flowers which are often associated with Mary. The dove above her head symbolizes the Holy Ghost, while the rose and the lilies are her customary symbols, lilies representing her purity, while the rose is the symbol for Mary, Queen of heaven and earth. Her girdle should be the cord of St. Francis.\r The globe symbolizing the whole world, the crescent moon and the starry crown above her head are traditional symbols of the \"woman clothed with the sun\" (Virgo in Sole) described in Revelations 12:1-2. The crescent moon itself is an ancient symbol of chastity deriving from the Roman goddess Diana. Just as the moon derives its light from the sun, so Mary's special grace derives from the merits of Christ, her Son. The obelisk to her right also shimmers in the light of the sun and references traditional symbols of the Immaculate Conception associated with the Tower of David and the Ivory Tower, evoking impregnability, virginity and purity. Mary is depicted as trampling a serpent holding an apple in its mouth, representing the serpent in the Garden of Eden and Original Sin. A palm branch, and a mirror are seen under her feet. The palm branch signifies Mary's victory and exaltation, the mirror her purity.\n", "\nArtist: Canaletto\nArtwork Name: Stonemason's Yard\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/canaletto/stonemason-s-yard-1727\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Stonemason's Yard (formally known as Campo S. Vidal and Santa Maria della Carit\u00e0) is an early oil painting by Giovanni Antonio Canal, better known as Canaletto. Painted in the mid to late 1720s, it is considered one of Canaletto's finest works.\r The painting, 123.8\u00a0cm tall and 162.9\u00a0cm wide, depicts a Venetian scene looking roughly southwest over a temporary stonemason's yard situated in an open space beside the Grand Canal known as the Campo San Vidal (\"campo\", literally field, used in Venice to denote a small open space). Several masons are at work shaping and carving stone probably destined for the reconstruction of the nearby church of San Vidal (immediately behind the viewer and so not visible in the painting; its Palladian fa\u00e7ade was renovated in the 1730s) or possibly for the embellishment of a nearby palazzo (the Palazzo Cavalli-Franchetti and Palazzo Barbaro are close by, to the viewer's left). The side of the medieval church of Santa Maria della Carit\u00e0, reconstructed in the 1440s, stands on the opposite bank of the Grand Canal, to the left of the fa\u00e7ade of the Scuola Grande della Carit\u00e0; the tower of the church of San Trovaso is visible rising over the rooftops in the distance.\r In addition to the architectural details, The Stonemason's Yard shows scenes of daily life in Venice, probably in the early morning: a cock crows on a windowsill to the lower left, and sunlight streams in from the left behind the viewer's (east). The mainly domestic buildings are generally in poor repair, with typical Venetian flared chimney-pots. Laundry hangs from many of the windows, and pot plants stand on several balconies. One woman is using a distaff and drop spindle to spin thread on a balcony to the right; another draws water from a well in the campo beside a wooden shed, from a well-head shaped like the capital of a column. Two children are playing in the foreground to the left: one is falling over and urinating involuntarily in surprise, as a woman lunges forward to catch him; another woman looks down from a balcony above. A gondola with canopied cabin passes on the canal, with others moored on either bank.\r Unsigned and undated, the painting is attributed and dated by stylistic clues. The informal scene is thought to have been painted for a Venetian patron, rather than a foreign visitor to Venice, in the mid to late 1720s.\r Unlike many views painted by Canaletto and his fellow vedutisti, the location has changed significantly since the 1720s. The view of the opposite bank of the Grand Canal is now blocked by the high arch of the modern wooden Accademia bridge, and the church of the Carit\u00e0 has been much altered. The campanile fell down in the 1740s, demolishing the houses beside the canal in front, and much of the other stonework has been removed. The nave became the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia in the 1800s, and the Gallerie dell'Accademia is housed in the Scuola. The Campo remains an open space, with the well-head at its centre. The domestic building to the right remains standing.\n", "\nArtist: Canaletto\nArtwork Name: Capriccio: a Palladian Design for the Rialto Bridge, with Buildings at Vicenza\nArtwork Genre: capriccio\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/canaletto/capriccio-a-palladian-design-for-the-rialto-bridge-with-buildings-at-vicenza\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Capriccio with Palladian buildings (Italian: Capriccio con edifici palladiani) is an oil painting on canvas (58x82 cm) by Canaletto, dating from about 1756 to 1759 and stored in the Galleria Nazionale Di Parma.\n", "\nArtist: Francesco Guardi\nArtwork Name: The Doge on the Bucintoro near the Riva di Sant'Elena\nArtwork Genre: veduta\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francesco-guardi/the-doge-on-the-bucintoro-near-the-riva-di-sant-elena-1770\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Doge on the Bucintoro near the Riva di Sant'Elena (also known as The Departure of the Bucentaur for the Ascension Day Ceremony, and other similar titles) is an oil on canvas by Venetian painter Francesco Guardi, a member of the Venetian School. It was painted between 1766 and 1770, and is currently held and exhibited at the Louvre in Paris.\r This painting entered the Louvre as a result of a confiscation in 1797 of the Count Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Xavier de Pestre de Seneffe 1797's collection. It was selected by the Louvre, with eleven other paintings in the same series, at the H\u00f4tel de Nesle; it was then sent to the Mus\u00e9um de Toulouse (now a museum of natural history), which subsequently handed it back to the Louvre in exchange for a portrait by Ingres and another painting by Guardi, in 1952.\r This work is one of a series of twelve paintings representing the Solennit\u00e0 dogali (The Doge's Solemnities), in which the artist has faithfully copied the scenes drawn by Giovanni Antonio Canal and engraved by Giambattista Brustolon to commemorate the festivities at the coronation of the Doge Alvise Giovanni Mocenigo, in 1763. This has led to some confusion, and the canvases were formerly attributed to Canaletto, though their style was quite unmistakably that of Guardi.\r Under the First French Empire, the series was unfortunately broken up: seven remained in the Louvre, one was sent to Brussels, two to Nantes, one to Toulouse and one to Grenoble. The return in 1952 of the Toulouse painting to the Louvre, through the aforementioned exchange, has been the first step in an attempt to reassemble the set and display them in a special room. Today ten paintings of the series are exhibited in the Louvre.\r This painting and another in the series represent the Festa della Sensa, the most sumptuous of all Venetian festivals. It took place each year on Ascension Day, the anniversary of the setting out of Doge Pietro II Orseolo's expedition, which achieved the conquest of Dalmatia in c. 1000. It was also a celebration of the Treaty of Venice of 1177 with the Doge Sebastiano Ziani, Pope Alexander III and the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick Barbarossa. In a magnificent state barge, known in fact as the Bucentaur (It. Bucintoro), the Doge visited the Lido and celebrated the Marriage of the Sea ceremony of Venice with the Adriatic Sea, by casting a ring into the waters.\r This particular canvas shows the Bucentaur leaving Venice.

He completed a cartoon for the work in 1793 which was favourably received by art critics active in Rome at the time. However, when he produced a first version of the painting in 1796, it was less well-received and so he destroyed it and started again from scratch, completing the surviving version in 1806. The Earl had died in 1803 and his heirs refused to pay for the work, so Camuccini instead sold it to Gioacchino Murat in 1807. After Murat's fall, it was acquired by Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies and relocated to the Palazzo Reale in Naples.

Painted in the Futurist style, the work centres on a woman on a balcony in front of a busy street, with the sounds of the activity below portrayed as a riot of shapes and colours.\r The first public display of the painting was in Paris, in 1912, as part of the first Futurist exhibition. It is now housed in the Sprengel Museum in Hanover, Germany.\r Boccioni was one of the founding members of the Futurist movement. Until 1910, the group concentrated primarily on capturing \"emotion and multiple states of mind\" using techniques derived from Neoimpressionism style (for example, Severini's The Black Cat or The Obsessive Dancer). After hearing second-hand reports of the innovations of Picasso and Braque, Boccioni and his compatriots adapted their technique to match, incorporating angular lines and intersecting planes as a way of capturing multiple viewpoints in a two-dimensional image. While this was going on, there was a corresponding shift in what the group was attempting to capture as well. They began to focus more heavily on the physical and the external rather than the emotional and internal.\r In 1910, Boccioni began a series of works based on modern urbanism. The first, The City Rises, described the construction of a new city and the sights and sounds of men and horses at work. He described it as a \"great synthesis of labour, light, and movement.\" His later works, such as The Forces of the Street, The Street Enters the House, Simultaneity of Vision, and Street-pavers and A Study of a Woman Among Buildings were elaborations on the same theme.\r The central figure of The Street Enters the House is a woman dressed in blue and white, viewed from behind and above. She looks over her balcony at a busy street scene, a riot of colours, lines, and angles. On the road in front of her, workers lift poles to form the walls of a new building, surrounded by a pile of bricks. On every side of this construction, white and blue houses lean into the street. Two of the balconies are occupied by other figures peering down into the road. A line of horses flies past the foreground.\r The identity of the woman in The Street Enters the House is the subject of some debate. While several scholars postulate that she was an entirely imagined character, Boccioni had a history of employing the women of his family as models. This has led some to the conclusion that the figure is Boccioni's mother, and use the depiction in The Street Enters the House as evidence of Boccioni's changing view of women in general and mothers in particular.\r The painting in general showcases Boccioni's evolution from a Neoimpressionist style to one more aligned with the ideals of Cubism, and the catalog description for the piece demonstrates his increasing fascination with scientific terminology. It includes lines such as \"The principles of Roentgen rays is applied to the work, allowing the personages to be studied from all sides, objects both at the front and the back are in the painter's memory.\" Boccioni experiments with Cubist techniques as a way of keeping elements in both the foreground and background \"rushing into the window at the same time\" He also weaves in references to his earlier works. See for example, the visual pun of the horse's appearance on the woman's buttock when compared with a line from his earlier Manifesto: \"How often have we seen upon the cheek of the person with whom we are talking the horse which passes at the end of the street.\"\n", "\nArtist: Katsushika Hokusai\nArtwork Name: The Great Wave off Kanagawa\nArtwork Genre: marina\nArtwork Media: woodcut\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai/the-great-wave-of-kanagawa-1831\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Great Wave off Kanagawa (\u795e\u5948\u5ddd\u6c96\u6d6a\u88cf, Kanagawa-oki nami ura, \"Under a wave off Kanagawa\"), also known as The Great Wave or simply The Wave, is a woodblock print by the Japanese ukiyo-e artist Hokusai. It was published sometime between 1829 and 1833 in the late Edo period as the first print in Hokusai's series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It is Hokusai's most famous work, and one of the most recognizable works of Japanese art in the world.\r The image depicts an enormous wave threatening boats off the coast of the town of Kanagawa (the present-day city of Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture). While sometimes assumed to be a tsunami, the wave is more likely to be a large rogue wave. As in many of the prints in the series, it depicts the area around Mount Fuji under particular conditions, and the mountain itself appears in the background.\r Impressions of the print are in many Western collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the British Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, and in Claude Monet's home in Giverny, France, among many other collections.\r Hokusai began painting when he was six years old. At age twelve, his father sent him to work at a booksellers. At sixteen, he was apprenticed as an engraver and spent three years learning the trade. At the same time he began to produce his own illustrations. At eighteen he was accepted as an apprentice to Katsukawa Shunsh\u014d, one of the foremost ukiyo-e artists of the time.\r In 1804 he became famous as an artist when, during a festival in Tokyo, he completed a 240m\u00b2 painting of a Buddhist monk named Daruma. In 1814, he published the first of fifteen volumes of sketches entitled Manga. His Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji, from which The Great Wave comes, was produced from c.\u20091830.\r From the sixteenth century fantastic depictions of waves crashing on rocky shores were painted on folding screens known as \"rough seas screens\" (ariso by\u014dbu). Hokusai drew many waves throughout his career; the genesis of the Great Wave can be traced back over thirty years. The combination of wave and mountain was inspired by an oil painting by Shiba K\u014dkan, an artist strongly influenced by the Western art, particularly Dutch paintings, he had seen at Nagasaki, the only port open to foreigners in this period. K\u014dkan's A View of Seven-League Beach was executed in middle of 1796 and exhibited publicly at the Atago shrine in Shiba. Hokusai's print Springtime at Enoshima, which he contributed to The Willow Branch poetry anthology published in 1797, is clearly derived from K\u014dkan's work, although the wave in Hokusai's version rises noticeably higher.\r Closer compositionally to the Great Wave are two later prints by Hokusai: Kanagawa-oki Honmoku no zu (c.\u20091803) and Oshiokuri Hato Tsusen no Zu, (c.\u20091805) Both works have subjects identical to the Great Wave: a sailboat and a rowboat respectively. In both precursor works, the subjects are in the midst of a storm, beneath a great wave that threatens to devour them. An analysis of the differences between the two works and the Great Wave demonstrates the artistic and technical development of Hokusai:\n", "\nArtist: Taro Okamoto\nArtwork Name: Tower of the Sun\nArtwork Genre: sculpture\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/taro-okamoto/tower-of-the-sun-1970\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Tower of the Sun (\u592a\u967d\u306e\u5854, Taiy\u014d no T\u014d) is a building created by Japanese artist Tar\u014d Okamoto. It was known as the symbol of Expo '70 and currently is preserved and located in the Expo Commemoration Park in Suita, Osaka, Japan. The tower has three faces on its front and back.\r Originally, the tower was built for Expo '70 and housed in the Festival Plaza building known as \"Big Roof\" designed by Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. The tip of the tower projected out of the Big Roof's ceiling due to the height of the building. After the completion of the tower projecting through the Big Roof, a Japanese science fiction writer, Sakyo Komatsu, looked at it and said he associated it with a sexual description in a Japanese novel, Season of the Sun, where a character broke through a sliding paper door. The creator of the tower, Taro Okamoto, heard about it, and named the tower as the \"Tower of the Sun\".\r The tower was open to the public and visitors could enter inside during the expo, yet it was closed after the event. The gallery inside displayed a huge artwork called the \"Tree of Life\", which represented the evolution of creatures. The Tsuburaya Productions partly produced the artwork. The Big Roof housing the tower was removed in 1979, causing the tower to be exposed for a long time. The tower has gradually deteriorated. Once a claim to demolish it arose, yet it was decided to be preserved and repair work began in November 1994, ending in March 1995.\r On October 11 and 12, 2003, the inside of the Tower of the Sun was opened to a selected 1,970 people (the figure was chosen for the year the expo was held). Prior to the opening, over 24,000 people applied for it so the Commemorative Organization for the Japan World Exposition '70 made a decision to open the tower again in November and December in the same year. The event to release the inside irregularly continued, and over 40,000 people in total visited the inside of the tower until October 2006. Due to the repair and renovation for the 40th anniversary event of the Expo '70 in 2010, access to the Tower's interior was closed again. After additional repairs it was to be permanently open to the public starting in 2014. As of December, 2015, the Tower's interior is not open to the public.\r The tower's height is 70 metres, the diameter at the base is 20 metres, and each of the two arms is 25 metres long. The tower has currently three faces, two faces on the front, and a face in the back. The face located at the top, whose diameter is 11 metres, represents the future. An antenna attached to it works as a conductor. In the eyes of the face, Xenon arc lamps were used during the expo, however they became decrepit and broken down after the expo. On September 25, 2004, new lights were installed next to the old ones and lit to advertise the Expo 2005. A face between two arms represents the present, and a black face on the rear of the tower is the sun of the past. Originally another face, \"Sun of the Underworld\" was located on the basement floor, yet currently it has been moved to an unknown location. The jagged red paintings on the front of the tower represent thunder.\n", "\nArtist: Maurycy Gottlieb\nArtwork Name: Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/maurycy-gottlieb/jews-praying-in-the-synagogue-on-yom-kippur-1878\n\nWikipedia Article:\nMaurycy Gottlieb made significant contributions towards creating the genre of Jewish Art. Gottlieb\u2019s 1878 painting Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur exemplifies many artistic values that are significant to Eastern European Jews at the time and contains many deeper meanings about Gottlieb\u2019s short life. The religious holiday of Yom Kippur (the holiest day of the Jewish year) is shown throughout this piece by the figures and symbolism. The color palette, location, human beings, and objects used all suggest a holiday of repentance and of importance. In this research paper, I will formally analyze the painting Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur, examine the context of the painting and how Gottlieb\u2019s Jewish upbringing influences this work of art.\r Yom Kippur is the Jewish holiday of repentance and is a time for the Jewish people to pray and repent for their sins. As Soussloff writes in Jewish Identity in Modern Art History, \u201cYom Kippur is also the occasion in the Jewish year when the dead are solemnly commemorated (in the service called Yizkor), and Gottlieb has injected into this picture several prominent self-memorials.\u201d This piece shows the rabbi grasping the holy Torah (which contains the Old Testament); his expression is very somber and serious in keeping with the theme of the holiday they are observing. The location (a synagogue) is apropos considering the figures are observing the holiday of Yom Kippur. Gottlieb was a man who was proud of his Jewish heritage and wanted to show the world the religion and culture of Eastern European Jews. This painting was created on the days of atonement (preceding the day of Yom Kippur) but the setting of the piece is on the actual day of Yom Kippur. In his book Painting a People, Ezra Mendelsohn confirms that Gottlieb\u2019s subject in this painting is the Days of Atonement: \u201cNathan Samuely, who discussed the work with Gottlieb in 1878, does specifically connect it, in his German essay on the artist published in 1885, with Yom Kippur, and informs us that the artist himself had the idea of painting it during the days of repentance preceding this holiday.\u201d Not only does this piece show the observance of the specific holiday of Yom Kippur, but it also highlights the many differences of how Jewish people observe general holidays and how they dress in a unique fashion as opposed to gentiles.\r Every figure in the synagogue has a serious look on their face. They could be listening to the rabbi\u2019s sermon at the podium or reflecting upon their actions in the past year. It is very obvious they are in a place of prayer because of several objects placed in the temple and the way the figures are dressed. For example, many of the adult men are wearing talith (a holy cloth) and yarmulke\u2019s (head coverings). These holy pieces of clothing are worn when praying in a synagogue. There is a Torah in the center of the composition, stained glass windows in the back, and candles on the top left. As Mendelsohn writes, \u201ccandles, at the left of the painting help provide the light.\u201d The viewer can easily tell that the light is coming from the left of the painting which is where the candles are located. There is a quote/inscription on the wall that talks about the triumph of the Torah.

It is sometimes referred to as What I Saw in the Water.  Frida Kahlo\u2019s What the Water Gave Me has been called her biography. As the scholar, Natascha Steed, points out, \"her paintings were all very honest and she never portrayed herself as being more or less beautiful than she actually was.\" With this piece she reflected on her life. Kahlo released her unconscious mind through the use of what seems to be an irrational juxtaposition of images in her bathwater. In this painting, Frida paints herself, precisely her legs and feet, lying in a bath of grey water.  The painting was included in Kahlo's first solo exhibit at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York City in November 1938. It is now part of the private collection of Surrealist art collector Daniel Filipacchi.  Kahlo's toes point up from the water in a bathtub and are reflected back into the water. They dominate the painting, and, along with an underwater view of her thighs, are all that can be seen of her in this self-portrait. In the water float remnants of Kahlo's life. There is an island which holds a volcano erupting a skyscraper, a dead woodpecker perched upon a tree, and a small skeleton resting upon a hill. From this island a tight rope begins which creates a diamond-like shape within the center of the tub, and eventually wraps around the neck of a naked female figure, who floats Ophelia-like. From this female figure, who may represent Kahlo herself, the rope returns into the hand of a faceless man lounging on the edge of the island, who seems to be watching the woman that he is distantly strangling.  Also floating in the bathtub are an empty Mexican dress, a seashell full of bullet-holes, a couple that resemble Kahlo's parents from her earlier painting My Grandparents My Parents and I, and two female lovers who later reappear in her 1939 painting Two Nudes in a Forest.  The painting references traditional and ancient iconography, mythology and symbolism, eroticism and botany all mapped out onto a scene depicting the legs of the artist herself (as signified by her wounded right foot) submerged in bath water. References to Kahlo's earlier works and influences have been noted. These include themes from her painting My Parents, My Grandparents and I (1936), allusions to fifteenth-century painter Hieronymus Bosch's The Garden of Earthly Delights in her attention to flora and fauna, and a reference to her political position by documenting the clash of the old and the new in the dramatic detail of a skyscraper burning inside a volcano. Among the various elements of macabre that are visible, a skeleton and a nude bather choked by a rope stand out.  What the Water Gave Me  was Frida's memoir of her life, depicting life and death and comfort and loss. In the midst of her vision lies the way in which Frida found herself submerged by her life. Frida is quoted saying \"I drank to drown my pain, but the damned pain learned how to swim, and now I am overwhelmed by this decent and good behavior.\" Scholar Graham Watt stated that a common feature of Kahlo's paintings is duality, as Kahlo painted \"the body she lost and the body she had, her heterosexual and lesbian affairs, traditional and modern ways, Mexican and European, the closeness and treachery of those she loved, sadness and joy as well as the community of her world view and the loneliness of her position.\" Frida found only her hardships in her bath.  In this portrait Kahlo appears lifeless as she lies in a bathtub submerged in water, her legs barely visible but her feet emerge from the water. Her right foot is bleeding and deformed, reflecting what was happening to her body while she suffered in pain.\n", "\nArtist: Frida Kahlo\nArtwork Name: The Two Fridas\nArtwork Genre: self-portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/the-two-fridas-1939\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Two Fridas (Las dos Fridas in Spanish) is an oil painting by Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. The painting was the first large-scale work done by Kahlo and is considered one of her most notable paintings. It is a double self-portrait, depicting two versions of Kahlo seated together. One is wearing a white European-style Victorian dress while the other is wearing a traditional Tehuana dress. The painting is housed at the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City.  Kahlo painted The Two Fridas in 1939, the same year she divorced artist Diego Rivera, although they remarried a year later. According to Kahlo's friend, Fernando Gamboa, the painting was inspired by two paintings that Kahlo saw earlier that year at the Louvre: Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau's The Two Sisters and the anonymous Gabrielle d'Estr\u00e9es and One of Her Sisters.  In January 1940, The Two Fridas was exhibited along with The Wounded Table at the International Surrealist Exhibition in Mexico City.  The painting remained in Kahlo's possession until it was acquired by the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (INBA) in 1947. The INBA transferred it to the Museo de Arte Moderno on December 28, 1966, where it is presently housed.  Some art historians have suggested that the two figures in the painting are a representation of Frida's dual heritage. Her father, Guillermo Kahlo, was German; while her mother, Matilde Calderon, was Mestizo (a mix of Spanish and Native American). Another interpretation is that the Tehuana Frida is the one who was adored by her husband Diego Rivera, while the European Frida is the one that was rejected by him. In Frida's own recollection, the image is of a memory of a childhood imaginary friend.  Both Fridas hold items in their lap; the Mexican Frida holds a small portrait of Diego Rivera, and the European Frida holds forceps. Blood spills onto the European Frida's white dress from a broken blood vessel that has been cut by the forceps. The blood vessel connects the two Fridas, winding its way from their hands through their hearts. The work alludes to Kahlo's life of constant pain and surgical procedures and the Aztec tradition of human sacrifice. Because this piece was completed by Kahlo shortly after her divorce, the European Frida is missing a piece of herself, her Diego.\n", "\nArtist: Jan Matejko\nArtwork Name: Skarga`s Sermon\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-matejko/skarga-s-sermon-1864\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Sermon of Piotr Skarga or Skarga's Sermon (Polish: Kazanie Skargi) is a large oil painting by Jan Matejko, finished in 1864, now in the National Museum, Warsaw in Poland. It depicts a sermon on political matters by the Jesuit priest Piotr Skarga, a chief figure of the Counter Reformation in Poland, where he rebukes the Polish elite for neglecting the national interest.\r Skarga's Sermon is among Matejko's most famous works, and like other historical paintings by Matejko includes several portraits of identifiable historical figures of the period depicted, as well as in this case a self-portrait of the artist in the figure of Skarga.\r Matejko finished the painting in May 1864. It was the first \"large\" painting of Matejko (the canvas had the size of over 8 square metres (86\u00a0sq\u00a0ft), several times larger than any of his prior work). It was displayed in the gallery of the Krak\u00f3w Society of Friends of Fine Art (Towarzystwo Przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 Sztuk Pi\u0119knych w Krakowie). Painting's premiere drew crowds and reviews comparable with modern movie premieres. Soon afterwards Count Maurycy Potocki bought it for 10,000 guldens.\r The painting shows Poland of the early 17th century, a country torn between the magnates and elected kings of the House of Vasa, with a proud and egotistical nobility, beginning a slide into an ungovernable anarchy. In that context, little heed was paid to the calls of many individuals (such as Skarga) for reform. Matejko's work became one of the major elements of the \"legend of Piotr Skarga\", helping the Jesuit achieve a lasting fame in Poland. Although Matejko's work fits within the genre of historical painting, with the Sermon... he departed from strict adherence to historical accuracy, focusing more on the message; thus this painting, like many of his subsequent works, included characters or items that could not have been present at the depicted scene.\r The painting portrays Piotr Skarga, a Jesuit, giving a sermon in the presbytery of the Wawel Cathedral. He is visible at the top right, clad in black, with his hands raised, paused in the middle of the speech. His face is that of Matejko himself, if significantly aged (another source, however, suggests that Matejko asked Micha\u0142 Szweycer to pose for Skarga instead). Skarga is the only animated character in the composition, all other individuals are shown as immobile, standing or sitting. The title of the painting suggests that the theme of Skarga's speech is his famous critique of the Polish government and a prophecy of its destruction. In reality, however, there is no proof that Skarga's work was ever delivered in the form of a real sermon.\r Various historical figures, listening to the sermon, react to it through posture and facial expressions in a manner that suggest Matejko's view of their historical role. In the center, magnates Janusz Radziwi\u0142\u0142 (1579-1620) (in a golden robe), Stanis\u0142aw Stadnicki, Miko\u0142aj Zebrzydowski, stand together, arrogant and unfazed. Jerzy Mniszech, Jan Piotr Sapieha and Janusz Zbaraski to their right seem to be listening, but an older nobleman is dozing nearby as a reminder that most nobility did not care either way about the issues Skarga is discussing. To their left, the king, Sigismund III Vasa, seems not to be paying too much attention to the preacher. His foreign garb stresses his unwillingness to integrate with his subjects; he always considered himself more of a Swede than a Pole, and would have preferred to be a king of Sweden instead. Sigismund is portrayed by Matejko as the second most important character in the painting, as he is also illuminated by light, albeit immobile, compared to Skarga. Sigismund's son, prince and future king W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Waza, stands above and to the left of the king. To his right, two women - Queen Anna Jagiellonka and Halszka Ostrogska are present. A glove on the floor between the king and the magnates is a sign of the upcoming civil war.\n", "\nArtist: Jan Matejko\nArtwork Name: The Union of Lublin\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-matejko/the-union-of-lublin-1869\n\nWikipedia Article:\nUnion of Lublin (Polish: Unia lubelska) is an oil painting by the Polish artist Jan Matejko, finished in 1869, depicting the Union of Lublin.\n", "\nArtist: Jan Matejko\nArtwork Name: Bathory at Pskov\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-matejko/bathory-at-pskov-1872\n\nWikipedia Article:\nStephen B\u00e1thory at Pskov or B\u00e1thory at Pskov (Polish - Stefan Batory pod Pskowem) is an 1872 history painting by the Polish artist Jan Matejko, now in the collections of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland.

The canvas dates to 1878 and is one of the most heroic representations of the history of Poland and Lithuania. It is displayed in the National Museum in Warsaw.\r The painting's main focus is the death scene of the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Ulrich von Jungingen; another central figure is the Lithuanian grand duke Vytautas the Great, dressed in red with a raised sword. The painting has been both hailed and criticized for its complexity. It is one of Matejko's most recognizable works, and has likely contributed to the popular image of the battle of Grunwald, and its enduring fame in Polish consciousness.\r Matejko began collecting materials for the painting in 1874. He started painting the canvas some time in 1875 and finished it in 1878. Soon afterwards, he received a scepter from the council of Krak\u00f3w in an official ceremony, in recognition of his work and his position as one of the most respected Polish artists. The painting was sold that year to Dawid Rosenblum, a private individual in Warsaw. Displayed in numerous international exhibitions, in 1902 the painting was bought from Rosenblum's heirs by the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts (Towarzystwo Zach\u0119ty Sztuk Pi\u0119knych) and displayed in Warsaw.\r Like many other works, the Battle of Grunwald was hidden during the occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany. Together with Prussian Homage, it was one of the two artworks that topped the \"most wanted\" paintings list made by the Nazis, who engaged in a systematic action of physical destruction of all artifacts of Polish culture. Goebbels offered a bounty of 10 million marks for it, and several members of the Polish Underground were executed by the Germans when they refused to divulge its location despite interrogation and torture. The painting survived the war years hidden near Lublin.\r Restored after World War II, since 1949 this oil painting has been on display in the National Museum in Warsaw. In 1999 the Battle of Grunwald was loaned to Lithuania, where it garnered a positive reception because it prominently features Vytautas, who is considered a national hero in that country. By the 2000s, the painting needed restoration. In 2010, the poor condition of the painting prevented its inclusion in a special exhibition at Wawel Castle to mark the 600th anniversary of the battle. The painting was renovated, with the work finished in 2012. After restoration the painting is once again on display at the National Museum.\r The Battle of Grunwald is a painting by Matejko that portrays events from the history of Poland and Lithuania, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the struggles of Eastern European principalities against Teutonic knights in general. In the center of the painting is the Lithuanian grand duke Vytautas the Great (Witold), dressed in red with a raised sword. Vytautas holds a more prominent position in the painting than his cousin, Polish king W\u0142adys\u0142aw Jagie\u0142\u0142o (Jogaila), who is visible in the second plan, mounted, in the top right side. According to Scales and Zimmer, by focusing on Vytautas rather than Jagie\u0142\u0142o, Matejko stressed the importance of Lithuania for Poland, and the value of cooperation between the two countries in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian union. Others have noted that this placement likely was influenced by Matejko's reliance on the writings of Jan D\u0142ugosz, who attributed greater importance to Vytautas than to Jagie\u0142\u0142o, who, by some polish sources, commanded the battle. While Lithuanian sources claim that Vytautas The Great have got the very major role in the battle by actually commanding troops. In the skies above the carnage, Saint Stanislaus, a patron of Poland, overlooks the fighting.\n", "\nArtist: Jan Matejko\nArtwork Name: The Prussian Homage\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-matejko/the-prussian-homage-1882\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Prussian Homage (Polish: Ho\u0142d pruski) is an oil on canvas painting by Polish painter Jan Matejko painted between 1879 and 1882 in Krak\u00f3w (then part of Austria-Hungary). The painting depicts the \"Prussian Homage,\" a significant political event from the time of the Renaissance in Poland in which Albrecht Hohenzollern, the Duke of Prussia paid tribute and swore allegiance to King Sigismund I the Old in Krak\u00f3w's market square on 10 April 1525. Matejko depicted over thirty important figures of the Polish Renaissance period, taking the liberty of including several who were not actually present at the event.\r The painting glorifies this event in Poland's past and its culture, and the majesty of its kings. At the same time, the painting has darker undertones, reflecting the troubled times that befell Poland in the late eighteenth century, for the Kingdom of Prussia would become one of the partitioning powers that ended the independence of Poland. The painting was seen by some as anti-Prussian, foretelling its perceived betrayal of Poland; others have noted it is also critical of Poland, as Matejko included signs that signify this seemingly triumphant moment was a hollow, wasted victory. Matejko created his painting to remind others about the history of the no-longer-independent country he loved, and about the changing fates of history. The painting is counted among his masterpieces.\r Matejko began to paint the Prussian Homage on Christmas Eve 1879 and finished it in 1882. He donated it to the Polish nation during the meeting of the Diet of Galicia (Sejm Krajowy) in Lw\u00f3w (Lviv) on 7 October 1882 to start a collection designed to revive the remodelling of Wawel Castle. It was subsequently exhibited in Krak\u00f3w, Lw\u00f3w and Warsaw, as well as in Berlin, Paris, Budapest, and most notably in Rome and Vienna. When it returned to Krak\u00f3w in 1885, it was temporarily exhibited in the Sukiennice Museum because the Royal Wawel Castle was occupied at that time by the Austrian army, as Krak\u00f3w was part of the Austrian partition of Poland.\r Because of the pro-Polish and anti-Prussian character of the painting German emperor William I objected to a proposal to reward Matejko. During this period, Prussia was trying to suppress Polish culture in its territory and Germanise it. During World War II, the Nazis systematically tried to destroy all Polish cultural artefacts in occupied Poland. This painting, together with Matejko's painting of the Battle of Grunwald, was on their \"most wanted\" list. Fortunately it was hidden and safeguarded throughout the war in the town of Zamo\u015b\u0107.\r For most of the twentieth and at the beginning of the twentieth-first centuries, the painting has been hung in the National Museum gallery in the Sukiennice Museum in Krak\u00f3w, where it is usually displayed in the Prussian Homage Hall.\r Renovation work started in the Sukiennice Museum in June 2008. The painting previously had been restored in 1915 and 1938. During World War II it was damaged while it was at Zamo\u015b\u0107, and in 1945 it was renovated. In 1974, experts again tried to restore it to its original condition before it went on public exhibition in Moscow. The most recent restoration process took place between 2006 and 2008, when the painting was finally returned to its former glory.\n", "\nArtist: Jan Matejko\nArtwork Name: The Constitution of the 3rd May 1791\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-matejko/the-constitution-of-the-3rd-may-1791-1891\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Constitution of May 3, 1791 (Polish: Konstytucja 3 Maja 1791 roku) is an 1891 Romantic oil painting on canvas by the Polish artist Jan Matejko. It is a large piece, and one of Matejko's best known. It memorializes the Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791, a milestone in the history of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the high point of the Polish Enlightenment.\r Like many Matejko works, the picture presents a grand scene populated with numerous historic figures, including Poland's last King, Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski; Marshals of the Great Sejm Stanis\u0142aw Ma\u0142achowski and Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha; co-authors of the Constitution such as Hugo Ko\u0142\u0142\u0105taj and Ignacy Potocki; and other major contemporary figures such as Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko. Some twenty individuals have been identified by modern historians; another ten or so who had been reported in older sources as being present, await definitive identification.\r The picture was painted between January and October 1891 to commemorate the Constitution's centenary. It was one of the last works by Matejko, who died in November 1893. The painting was displayed in Lw\u00f3w (now Lviv, Ukraine) until 1920, when it was moved to Krak\u00f3w. It was hidden during World War II and later moved to Warsaw, where it now hangs in the Royal Castle.\r The Constitution of May 3, 1791 was adopted as a \"Government Act\" (Polish: Ustawa rz\u0105dowa) on that date by the Sejm (parliament) of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It has been called \"the first constitution of its type in Europe\" and the world's second oldest constitution.\r It was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Commonwealth's system of \"Golden Liberty\", which conferred disproportionate rights on the nobility, had increasingly corrupted the Commonwealth's politics. The Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's magnates with a more democratic constitutional monarchy. It introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility (szlachta) and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto, which at one time had put the Sejm at the mercy of any deputy who might choose, or be bribed by an interest or foreign power, to undo the legislation adopted by that Sejm.\r The adoption of the May 3 Constitution met with hostile political and military responses from the Commonwealth's neighbors. In the Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792 (sometimes called the \"War in Defense of the Constitution\"), the Commonwealth was attacked by Catherine the Great's Imperial Russia allied with the Targowica Confederation, a coalition of Polish magnates and landless nobility who opposed reforms that might weaken their influence. The Commonwealth's ally Prussia, under Frederick William II, broke its alliance, and the Commonwealth was defeated. In the end, the Constitution of May 3 remained in force for little more than one year. Despite the Commonwealth's defeat in the Polish\u2013Russian War and the ensuing partitions which eliminated the Commonwealth, the May 3 Constitution remained for more than 123 years a beacon in the struggle to restore Polish sovereignty. In the words of two of its co-authors, Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Ko\u0142\u0142\u0105taj, it was \"the last will and testament of the expiring Country.\"\n", "\nArtist: Henryk Siemiradzki\nArtwork Name: Dance Amongst Daggers\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/henryk-siemiradzki/dance-amongst-daggers\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Sword Dance (Polish: Taniec w\u015br\u00f3d miecz\u00f3w) is an 1881 painting by the Polish painter Henryk Siemiradzki.

It presents the painter's grandson as Aleksander Wielopolski, Polish politician, a member of the Polish Kingdom government in the early 1860s, who tried to maneuver between the interests of the invaders and the Polish population. The figure is located in the center of the composition, surrounded by two women. He is dressed in yellow-green dress and belted pouch, in which instead of bullets are tubes of paint, and he thoughtfully pulls on the petals of chamomile.\r The painting is symbolic and patriotic, it can be read in several ways. The women placed on both sides of the picture are an allegory of two different visions of the fate of their homeland. Located to the right is an elderly woman with white hair, dressed in dark robes, her hands cuffed no shackles, and her face takes on an expression of sadness, despair and awareness of their situation. She embodies Poland enslaved, experienced by fate, remaining under the yoke of others, and who can not be liberated. On the left side there is a young girl, half-naked, shown at the time of breaking the shackles. She is full of energy, and her face has the expression of a very expressive. It symbolizes the \"young Poland\" - capable of action and being able to release from the long-term captivity.\r The image can be interpreted as a question of choosing the right way and the future fate of the homeland, entering a new century. This dilemma clearly refers to the title character of Hamlet, William Shakespeare's drama and his life choice, as highlighted in the title of the work. Alexander Wielopolski is an example of the person making the difficult decision, and carrying the consequences of that choice, resulting from the need to accept or reject the attitude towards life of his grandfather. The artist does not in favor which solution. The figure of a man is pensive, lost in melancholy, and his indecision which highlights even more the flower in his hand and a belt on the body. The work is an expression of his concern for the future of the Polish.\r In the literature, due to the fact that actually portrayed in the picture grandson and Alexander Wielopolski name was the same as his grandfather, there is often the wrong suggestion that image presented his grandfather. In fact, Jacek Malczewski could not portray his grandfather, because he died in 1877 and the picture was painted in 1903.

It depicts nineteen rusalki, who, according to Slavic mythology, were river or lake spirits who appeared at night in the form of young women. Some versions of the myths describe them as spirits who had died unbaptised or unmarried, or had drowned themselves following an unrequited love. They would emerge from the water at night, to sing and dance. They fulfilled a similar folkloric role to sirens; often enchanting young men before luring them to their deaths at the bottom of the water.\r The painting is based around works by Alexander Pushkin and Nikolai Gogol's 1831 fantastic story \"A May Night, or The Drowned Maidens\", and shows that despite the realist principles of the newly formed Peredvizhniki movement in which Kramskoi was a leading light, the artist continued to be interested in more Romantic fantasy and fairy-tale subject matter.\r The painting is set at night and is almost entirely without colour. The women occupy the centre mid-ground of the painting and are lit from high above the left hand of the canvas, presumably by the moon. The source of light throws shadow inconsistently.\r Most of the women are huddled together in a row, while some are at the edge of the bank or alone to the right seemingly lost in their own thoughts. In the left foreground the last of Kramskoi's rusalki is emerging from among the reeds, while in the background one of the women wrings out the water from her hair. The water bank is at the foot of a steep hill and surrounded by deep forest to the right. At the top of the small hill and to the right background is a small, seemingly unnoccupied cabin. The subject matter and composition is likely to have been influenced by the work of the Hungarian painter and designer Hans Makart.\r The Mermaids is held in the Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow.\n", "\nArtist: Ivan Kramskoy\nArtwork Name: Christ in the Wilderness\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil,watercolor\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/ivan-kramskoy/christ-in-the-wilderness-1872\n\nWikipedia Article:\nChrist in the Desert, or Christ in the Wilderness (Russian: \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441 \u0432 \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044b\u043d\u0435, tr. Khristos v pustyne) is a painting by Russian artist Ivan Kramskoi, reflecting the Fasting of Christ. Kramskoi was offered a professorship for the painting by the Russian Academy of Arts Council, but having learned that in the beginning of 1873, rejected it (he had been expelled from the Academy earlier, and chose to keep his \"youthful commitment to independence from the Academy\"). Subsequently, it became one of the favourite paintings of Pavel Tretyakov, who bought it for his gallery in the year the painting was finished.\r The theme of Christ's temptation had attracted Kramskoi already in the early 1860s. In that period he made the first sketch of the composition. The first version of Christ in the Desert is dated to 1867, but turned to be unsuccessful. Kramskoi realized that the choice of vertical format was inappropriate. He opted for the horizontal format and introduced the pallid rocky desert in the background.\r Kramskoi described the early history of the painting in his letters to writer Vsevolod Garshin.\r Christ in the Desert is one of Kramskoi's Jesus-themed paintings, the other being Rejoice, King of the Jews and Herodias. Kramskoy used primarily cold colors to reflect the chill dawn in the background. The thoughtful figure of Christ, wearing a dark wrap and red tunic underneath is slightly shifted to the right of the center. Kramskoi wrote: \"To the question \"this is not Christ, how do you know he looked like that?\", I permitted myself to reply \"but even the actual, living Christ has not been recognised\". The painting emphasizes Jesus' human constituent of hypostatic union and features a mind struggle instead of action. Because the horizon divides the canvas plane almost in half, the figure of Jesus dominates the painting space and harmonizes with stern wilderness simultaneously.\r Kramskoi sold his work to Tretyakov for 6,000 rubles.\r The painting received a wide feedback and appeared at the Peredvizhniks' second exposition of 1873. Pavel Tretyakov wrote: \"I liked Kramskoi's Saviour very much... that's why I was harrying up to purchase him, but many people did not appreciate him much and the others did not at all. In my opinion this is the best painting in our school recently; maybe I am mistaken\". Critic Vladimir Stasov noted that a \"sorrowful note sensibly resounds in the general physological array of the work\". Vsevolod Garshin outlined the \"expression of immense moral force, hatred against evil and complete resoluteness to fight it\". According to Ivan Goncharov, who wrote \"Christ in the Desert. A Painting of Mr. Kramskoi\" (original Russian title: \"\u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441 \u0432 \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044b\u043d\u0435\u00bb. \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0433. \u041a\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e\"), \"the entire figure seems to have diminished a bit from its natural size, contracted, not from starvation, thirst and bad weather, but from internal, inhuman insight to his thought and will during the struggle of forces of spirit and flesh\".

Neizvestnaya) is an oil painting by the Russian artist Ivan Kramskoi, painted in 1883. The model, whose identity is unknown, is a woman of \"quiet strength and forthright gaze\". It is one of Russia's best-known art works, although a number of critics were indignant when the painting was first exhibited and condemned what they saw as a depiction of a haughty and immoral woman. Its popularity has grown with changes in public taste.  The painting hangs in the Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow, while an earlier version, also dated 1883, is housed at the Kunsthalle Kiel.  Portrait of an Unknown Woman combines elements of the genre and portrait traditions in art. She is dressed in a black fur and velvet coat, fur hat, with leather gloves. The woman is seated on an open carriage at the Anichkov Bridge in Saint Petersburg.  Her identity has not been established by art historians. Kramskoi titled the painting Unknown, and did not mention her in any of his letters or diaries, leading to much speculation and the painting's highly enigmatic reputation.  The portrait was painted late in Kramskoi's life. He had begun his career as a rebel working outside of the establishment, and was early on expelled from the Russian Academy. By 1883, he was at the height of his fame and reputation and working at the highest level of patronage, producing portraits of Czar Alexander III and his wife Maria Feodorovna. He was also one of the founders and leaders of The Wanderers.  However, Portrait of an Unknown Woman caused a sensation when first exhibited, more as a result of the subject matter than the aesthetics of the work. A number of critics presumed that the woman was a prostitute. One critic described the painting as a portrayal of \"a coquette in a carriage\", while another wrote of \"a provocatively beautiful woman, all in velvet and fur, throwing you a sneeringly sensuous glance from a luxurious carriage \u2013 is this not one of the effluvia of big cities that allow contemptible women dressed in outfits purchased for the price of their female chastity onto the streets\". Kramskoi remarked, \"Some people have said it is not known who this woman is. Is she decent, or does she sell herself? But within her is an entire epoch.\"  Pavel Tretyakov refused to buy the painting for his gallery. However, its popularity quickly grew, in part as the beauty of sin became a popular theme amongst the following generation of Russian artists. It has been described as \"unusually bright, densely painted, and relaxed. Kramskoi clearly tried to shine with his outstanding painterly mastery.\"  The painting has been used as the cover for some editions of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina. In 2008, Guggenheim curator Valerie Hillings observed that, \"Many people just think she's sort of like Anna Karenina. She has that kind of special feel, that special Russianness\".\n", "\nArtist: Konstantin Makovsky\nArtwork Name: The Boyars' Wedding\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/konstantin-makovsky/the-boyars-wedding\n\nWikipedia Article:\nA Boyar Wedding Feast  was painted in 1883 by Russian artist Konstantin Makovsky (1839\u20131915). The painting shows a toast at a wedding feast following a boyar marriage, where the bride and the groom are expected to kiss each other. The bride looks sad and reluctant, while the elderly attendant standing behind her encourages the bride to kiss the groom. The work won a gold medal at the World\u2019s Fair held in Antwerp, Belgium in 1885, and is considered to be one of Makovsky\u2019s most popular works.\r Konstantin Makovsky was a Russian realist painter who opposed academic restrictions. His paintings venerate Russia's old world customs. A Boyar Wedding Feast is painted as a scene from the seventeenth-century \u2013 depicting the old way of Russian life, bringing back memories of the cherished past.\r A Boyar Wedding Feast is an oil on canvas painting measuring 93\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a0154\u00a0in (240\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a0390\u00a0cm), set in either the 16th or 17th century, in which a room of guests are depicted toasting a newlywed couple. A traditionally offered boyar wedding toast is meant to encourage the first kiss to make the wine sweeter. The couple stands at the head of the table (right), where the groom presents his bride to the wedding guests and sees her without her veil for the first time. She appears timid and bashful as the men toast for the first kiss. To the right of the couple, the \"Lady of Ceremony\" gently urges on the bride.\r Makovsky\u2019s depiction of the wedding, an important social event of 16th and 17th century boyar life, is dramatically lit. The guests are depicted at the table with food and drink served on silverware in front of them. A roasted swan is being brought in on a large platter, the last dish served before the couple retire into the bedroom. Luxurious details such as silver cups, richly embroidered garments, and an ivory chest with a silver bowl in the foreground are depicted. The bride and the other women are wearing pearl-studded kokoshniki, a Russian woman\u2019s headdress.\r Winning the 1885 medal of honor at the Exposition Universelle d'Anvers (2 May \u2013 2 November 1885), A Boyar Wedding Feast was purchased by American jeweler and art collector Charles William Schumann in August 1885 for $15,000 (or \u00a310,000). Schumann reportedly outbid Alexander III of Russia to obtain the work. The painting was auctioned as part of Schumann\u2019s estate on 23 January 1936 and sold for $2,500. Sometime after the sale, A Boyar Wedding Feast entered the collection of Robert Ripley, creator of Ripley's Believe It or Not!. It was sold during his estate sale on 26 August 1949 for $2,200. The painting was again offered for sale on 18 December 1968. Between 1968 and 1973, the painting was acquired by Marjorie Merriweather Post. Upon her death in 1973, the Hillwood Estate, Museum & Gardens was founded by Post's estate, and A Boyar Wedding Feast was donated to the collection.\r Notes\r Citations\r Bibliography\n", "\nArtist: Vladimir Tretchikoff\nArtwork Name: Chinese Girl.

It is housed in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in Paris (part of the La Caze bequest of 1869), and was painted in Naples. Art historian Ellis Waterhouse wrote of it as \"a touchstone by which we can interpret the whole of Ribera's art\".\r Commissioned by a Flemish dealer, the painting features a Neapolitan beggar boy with a deformed foot. Behind him is a vast and luminous landscape, against which the boy stands with a gap-toothed grin, wearing earth-toned clothes and holding his crutch slung over his left shoulder. Written in Latin on the paper in the boy's hand is the sentence \"DA MIHI ELEMOSINAM PROPTER AMOREM DEI\" (\"Give me alms, for the love of God\").\r This is one of the painter's last works, and one of the most bitter. The contrast of light and shade gave him pleasure. He studied the composition of the Renaissance painters in Italy, and perhaps also the work of Flemish artists, but in spite of all that, he clung to the profoundly Spanish tradition of realism, even after having spent nearly all his life in Italy.\r Moved by a Christian awareness of human weakness, Spanish artists often painted pictures of beggars, cripples and idiots. Here the young Neapolitan vagabond seems to be making game of his own infirmity; he is also careful to inform us, by means of the scrap of writing he holds, that he is dumb as well as crippled, because he appeals to the charity of the passer-by with that card written in Latin.\r The motif is surely a derivation of taste for scenes of low life in art, as instituted by Caravaggio and followed by Ribera, who was in Naples his most fervent admirer in the realist vein.\n", "\nArtist: Francisco de Zurbaran\nArtwork Name: Beato Serapio\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-de-zurbaran/beato-serapio-1628\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Serapion or The Martyrdom of Saint Serapion is a 1628 oil on canvas painting by the Spanish artist Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n (1598\u20131664). The work was commissioned by the Mercedarian Order to hang in the De Profundis (funerary chapel) hall of their monastery in Seville (now Museum of Fine Arts of Seville). Zurbar\u00e1n is noted for his portrayals of penitent or martyred monks and saints. Critic Tom Lubbock used this painting to illustrate a difference in the way the martyrdom of two different saints were depicted. He contrasted the understated and calm depiction of St. Serapion's violent death, with the equally or more violent death of the Jesuit priest and martyr Saint Edmund Campion (1540\u20131581) who was publicly hanged, drawn and quartered in London in December 1581. The art critic draws a comparison in the manner of depiction of Campion's death and that of Saint Serapion of Algiers (1179\u20131240), a Mercedarian friar who fought in the Third Crusade of 1196 and was later martyred.\r Saint Serapion is depicted by Zurbar\u00e1n in a quasi-crucified pose, standing with each hand bound by ropes and chain to an overhead horizontal pole. According to Michael Brenson of the New York Times, his head \"has shifted from the realm of the robe to the realm of the cape, which supports the head and seems to have the potential to lift it to the sky\". The painting stops at the figure's knee level, while the strain placed on his arms is indicated by the heavy hanging folds of the drapes of the cloth hanging from left shoulder and right outstretched arm. The saint is identified by text on a small note placed to the left of his chest area.\r The work makes strong use of chiaroscuro in the Spanish Tenebrist tradition of Jusepe de Ribera. The dominance of the white paint used to render the cloth creates a sense of tranquility, while the tension of the painting is derived from the dark shade created from the deep folds of the robes. In 2003, Scottish painter Alison Watt wrote, \"Each fold has been pared down to the basic elements of light and shade. As a viewer you are seduced by this simplicity, only to realise you have been duped. Zurbar\u00e1n has elevated the humble fabric of the robes of Saint Serapion to a divine level with pure, magnificent white.\"\r There is an allusion to Zurbur\u00e1n's depiction of Saint Serapion in the poem \"Meditations in an Emergency\" by the mid-twentieth century American poet Frank O'Hara:\n", "\nArtist: Francisco de Zurbaran\nArtwork Name: Still Life\nArtwork Genre: still life\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-de-zurbaran/still-life-1633\n\nWikipedia Article:\nStill Life with Lemons, Oranges and a Rose is an oil-on-canvas painting by Baroque Spanish artist Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n completed in 1633.

The date is not precisely known but is thought to be around the turn of 1618 before his definitive move to Madrid in 1623. The painting is in the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh. Vel\u00e1zquez frequently used working-class characters in early paintings like this one, in many cases using his family as models; the old woman here also appears in his Christ in the House of Martha and Mary (1618). There is some dispute about what cooking process is actually depicted with some suggesting not frying but poaching, leading to an alternative title of the painting, Old Woman Cooking Eggs or Old Woman Poaching Eggs.   Old Woman Frying Eggs is considered to be one of the strongest of Vel\u00e1zquez's early works. Like others, it shows the influence of chiaroscuro, with a strong light source coming in from the left illuminating the woman, her utensils and the poaching eggs, while throwing the background and the boy standing to her right into deep shadow. Here the chiaroscuro is very intense, so much so that it would be impossible to see the wall at the bottom of the painting but for the basket hanging from it; it simultaneously manages to combine the murky darkness and high contrasts of light and shadow with the use of subtle hues and a palette dominated by ochres and browns. The composition is organised as an oval with the middle figures in the nearest plane, thus drawing in the viewer.  The realism is nearly photographic and shows everyday plates, cutlery, pans, pestles, jugs and mortars, capturing the special shine on a glass surface and the light's play on the melon carried by the boy. The boiling pan is particularly well-captured, with its reflections and the whites of the eggs. Vel\u00e1zquez also worked particularly hard on the detail of the two figure's hands.\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Kitchen Scene with the Supper in Emmaus\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/kitchen-scene-with-the-supper-in-emmaus-1618\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Kitchen Maid (in Spanish La mulata, La cocinera or Escena de cocina (Kitchen Scene)) is one of two paired domestic paintings by Diego Rodr\u00edguez de Silva y Vel\u00e1zquez from his early Seville period. A wide range of dates has been suggested for its completion, although most place it between 1620 and 1622. This version is kept in the Art Institute of Chicago. The second version is held at the National Gallery of Ireland.\r Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez-Rey suggests that this picture could be related to a lost Vel\u00e1zquez painting described by Antonio Palomino...\"where a board is seen, that serves as a table, with a charcoal burner, and a pot boiling on top, and covered with a bowl, and the fire is visible, the flames, and the sparks are clearly visible, a small tin saucepan, an alcarraza, some plates, and some basins, a glazed jug, a mortar with its pestle and a head of garlic next to it; and on the wall there is small basket and a cloth hanging from a hook, and other trinkets; and guarding this is a boy holding a jug, wearing a coif, who with his humble clothes represents a subject that is very ridiculous and amusing\". The Dublin version was bequeathed by Alfred Beit in 1987. A 1933 cleaning revealed a depiction of Jesus\u2019 supper at Emmaus on the wall behind the main figure.\r The Chicago painting was bought from the Goudstikker gallery in Amsterdam by August L. Mayer and presented to the Institute in 1927. It was at the time thought to be the Vel\u00e1zquez original, relegating the Beit painting to the status of a copy. A number of art experts agreed with this opinion, including Bernardino Pantorba and Jos\u00e9 Gudiol, however, L\u00f3pez-Rey recognized that the painting in Dublin came from the hand of Vel\u00e1zquez, casting doubt on the originality of the painting in Chicago due to its poor state of conservation. The Vel\u00e1zquez expert Jonathan Brown agreed with this reasoning, suggesting that the Chicago painting was \u201cpossibly\u201d painted by Vel\u00e1zquez. In addition, he also suggested that the picture might be a copy produced by an artist who \u00abwanted to draw on the success of genre paintings by Vel\u00e1zquez and who might have produced a large number of replicas and versions of the originals\u00bb.\r The Kitchen Maid was restored in 1999 by Frank Zuccari. Despite paint losses, the best conserved parts show a similar quality, and in some aspects a superior quality, to the Dublin version. No trace has been found suggesting that the painting might have at any time had any religious significance or that it is anything other than a painting of a mulatto maid working in a kitchen. The painting contains a number of features that confirm its technical superiority over the Dublin version. In the Chicago version there are a greater number of folds on the upper part of the girl\u2019s coif and the treatment of the associated light and shadows is more meticulous, this is also seen in the crumpled cloth in the foreground. Superior technique is also seen in the depiction of light on the objects, particularly on the glazed ceramic jug that the maid is holding in her hand, in which it is possible to see the shine of the crackle glaze and marks left when the jug was formed on a potter\u2019s wheel. A possible explanation for this improvement in technique is that Vel\u00e1zquez returned to a previous theme in order to improve on it, concentrating on the tactile qualities of the painting, which were his main interest at the time, and disregarding the religious motif.\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Three Musicians\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/three-musicians-1618\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Three Musicians is an oil painting by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599-1660), a Spanish Baroque painter considered one of the great Spanish naturalists. It depicts three young men grouped around a dinner table playing music. It is painted in chiaroscuro, a Baroque painting technique that made use of the contrast between light and dark shadows to achieve a sense of volume.\r The Three Musicians is one of Vel\u00e1zquez's earliest works, from his early Seville period. It is one of approximately ten paintings in the bodeg\u00f3n style that Vel\u00e1zquez created before 1622, while living in Seville. Its subject is similar to that of another painting, The Farmers' Lunch. In this painting three young men are grouped around a table eating, drinking and playing music, with strong contrasts of light and darkness around the figures. The light falls from the left, creating sharp shadows and intense highlights. Two men with stringed instruments are singing while the third, the youngest, has an instrument of his own under his arm and a glass of wine in his hand; he displays the glass with a mocking smile, pointing out the wine that inspires the musicians. In the background can be seen a monkey with a pear in hand. The monkey emphasizes the grotesque nature of the scene.\r A loaf of bread on a napkin, a glass of wine, and a piece of cheese with a knife stuck into it give Vel\u00e1zquez the opportunity to study the different textures. An interesting feature of The Three Musicians is the variety of issues raised, such as whether it is a genre representation or whether behind the supposedly everyday scene there are hidden layers of meaning, which can make the picture readable as an allegory, giving it a different interpretation.\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Adoration of the Kings\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/adoration-of-the-kings-1619\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Adoration of the Magi is a 1619 Baroque painting by the Spanish artist Diego Vel\u00e1zquez now held in the Museo del Prado.

Housed in the National Gallery, London, United Kingdom, it was painted in 1618, shortly after he completed his apprenticeship with Pacheco. At this time, Vel\u00e1zquez was experimenting with the potential of the bodegones, a form of genre painting set in taverns (the meaning of bodegon) or kitchens which was frequently used to relate scenes of contemporary Spain to themes and stories from the Bible. Often they contained depictions of people working with food and drink.\r Vel\u00e1zquez has painted the interior of a kitchen with two half-length women to the left; the one on the left appeared in his Old Woman Cooking Eggs from the same period. On the table are a number of foods, perhaps the ingredients of an Aioli (a garlic mayonnaise made to accompany fish). These have been prepared by the maid. Extremely realistic, they were probably painted from the artist's own household as they appear in other bodegones from the same time.\r In the background is a biblical scene, generally accepted to be the story of Martha and Mary (Luke 10:38\u201342). In it, Christ goes to the house of a woman named Martha. Her sister, Mary, sat at his feet and listened to him speak. Martha, on the other hand, went to \"make all the preparations that had to be made\". Upset that Mary did not help her, she complained to Christ to which he responded: \"Martha, Martha, ... you are worried and upset about many things, but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.\" In the painting, Christ is shown as a bearded man in a blue tunic. He gesticulates at Martha, the woman standing behind Mary, rebuking her for her frustration.\r The plight of Martha clearly relates to that of the maid in the foreground. She has just prepared a large amount of food and, from the redness of her creased puffy cheeks, we can see that she is also upset. To comfort her (or perhaps even to rebuke her), the elderly woman indicates the scene in the background reminding her that she can not expect to gain fulfillment from work alone. The maid, who cannot bring herself to look directly at the biblical scene and instead looks out of the painting towards us, meditates on the implications of the story, which for a theologically alert contemporary audience included the traditional superiority of the vita contemplativa (spiritual life) over the vita activa (temporal life), not that the latter was inessential. Saint Augustine had drawn this moral from the story in the 5th century, followed by countless other divines. In the Counter-Reformation the usefulness of the \"active life\" was somewhat upgraded by many writers to counter Lutheran assertions of the spiritual adequacy of \"faith alone\".\r This is the most likely interpretation of the painting. However, scholars have given other readings of it. Some have argued over the identities of the characters, suggesting that the maid in the foreground is actually Martha herself and the lady standing in the background is just an incidental character.\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: St. Paul\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/st-paul\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSaint Paul (Spanish: San Pablo) is a painting by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez that is in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya in Barcelona, Spain. The piece was created around 1619 during the early stage of Vel\u00e1zquez's artistic career before he moved to Madrid. At this stage of Velazquez's career he was deeply influenced by Caravaggio. In the image, Saint Paul is seated holding a book, commonly referenced as a large Gospel book.\r The painting was created using oil on canvas. The artist from Seville reveals his mastery of portraiture in the image of a man captured directly from nature and wrapped in a wide robe in which the folds are almost sculptural. The dramatic lighting that brings the figure into relief against a dark background is a style inherited from Tenebrism, as are the earth-tone colors commonly used by Vel\u00e1zquez. They present to the viewer a natural and authentic representation of the figure. The saint is sitting on a stone plinth that blends with the background area. The fingers of the left hand grasp a thick book. Perhaps to hide his limitations, Vel\u00e1zquez has hidden the legs and most of the hands under its folds.\r According to Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez-Rey, Saint Paul's head is \"sharply drawn\" and the image itself is \"somewhat rubbed and darkened\", a style typical of Vel\u00e1zquez's early works.\r According to the New Testament, Paul was traveling to Damascus when he saw a bea of light and was visited by Jesus, who struck him blind. Three days later, Paul regained his sight and began to preach Christianity to the people. In this painting, Saint Paul is depicted wearing a large brown robe to symbolize his pilgrimage from the Holy Land to Damascus. The loose and thick cloak contains numerous creases, which suggest the heaviness of the fabric draping over a reddish/brown tunic. Saint Paul is commonly drawn with a tapering beard, brown hair, and a balding forehead to signify great wisdom and learning. However, Vel\u00e1zquez's image depicts Saint Paul with black hair that has a hint of grey in it, a very uncommon attribute for this figure. Vel\u00e1zquez's image of Saint Paul holds a blank stare, perhaps referencing his loss of eyesight from the legend.\r The text in the upper-left hand corner identifies the figure as S. PAVLVS (which means \"Saint Paul\" in Latin). He is depicted without the sword, his only known attribute. (If not holding a book, Saint Paul is more grimly represented with a severed head and the sword that killed him, which depicts his martyrdom.) A glowing aura, or halo, around the head of the figure symbolizes that he has a sense of holiness and was canonized as a saint. Although the aura of holiness is appropriate to the subject, the work also evokes the intellectual philosophers painted by Jos\u00e9 de Ribera. Vel\u00e1zquez deviated from the traditional representation of Saint Paul by drawing him with a book. The Gospel book that Saint Paul is holding symbolizes that this figure is an apostle and had a great influence on the spreading of the Christian religion.\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: The Lunch\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/the-lunch-1620\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Farmers' Lunch (Almuerzo de campesinos) is one of the earliest paintings by the Spanish artist Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.

The composition shows a younger man gesturing with his right hand to reinforce the story coming from his half-open lips, and an older man listening attentively while holding his cup up to a woman so she can refill it with wine.

The original version is considered to be among the finest works of the painter's Seville period and is displayed in the Waterloo Gallery of Apsley House.\r The painting exists in three versions. The version in the Apsley House, London, United Kingdom, was originally housed in the Royal Spanish Collection but stolen by Joseph Bonaparte at the time of the Napoleonic wars. The Duke of Wellington later won it back \u2013 along with 82 other paintings \u2013 at the Battle of Vitoria. The King of Spain allowed him to keep them in return for beating the French. Wellington brought the painting back to England where it remains to this day, in Apsley House, his former home. This version is hung in the Waterloo Gallery in the museum side of the House (the current Duke of Wellington holds several private rooms still) so can be viewed by the public.\r The version in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, painted two to four years earlier, has a rather more burlesque feel, with the seller wearing an ornate red hat. This may have been more in line with Vel\u00e1zquez's contemporaries' expectations due to the comical and devious image of the waterseller given in picaresque novels of the time.\r The third version, takes yet another angle on the waterseller. In this he appears almost despairing in his expression, perhaps to the extent of appearing farcical. The brilliant colours used are the most extreme of the three (with the pots taking on an altogether more shiny appearance). However, as in the Uffizi version, the characters lack the depth of personality present in the Wellington version.\r The subject of the painting is the waterseller, a common trade for the lower classes in Vel\u00e1zquez's Seville. The jars and victuals recall the bodeg\u00f3n paintings. The seller has two customers: a young boy, possibly painted from the same model as used for the boys in The Lunch and Old Woman Cooking Eggs, and a young man in the background shadows, (time has caused him to fade somewhat \u2013 he is clearer in the Uffizi version).\r In the foreground sit the seller's gigantic pots of water, glistening with splashes of water. So large and rounded, they almost protrude out of the painting into the observer's space. The seller hands a freshly poured glass of water to the boy. In it sits a fig, a perfumer intended to make the water taste fresher (something still done in Seville today).\r The still, calm scene \u2013 a typical quality of his genre scenes and, indeed, much of Vel\u00e1zquez's work \u2013 is remarkable for the depiction of the seller. His pensive face, battered by its direct exposure to sunlight and deeply scarred with the wrinkles of age, speaks of long years of experience. His short shaved hair and old plain clothes give him the appearance of a monk, saint, or eccentric philosopher. He gazes into nothing, indicating deep thought, almost unaware of those around him.\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Portrait of the Count Duke of Olivares\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/portrait-of-the-count-duke-of-olivares-1624\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of the Count-Duke of Olivares is a 1624 portrait by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (Seville, June 6, 1599 \u2013 Madrid, August 6 1660), the most celebrated painter of the Spanish Golden Age.

It is popularly known as Los borrachos or The Drinkers (politely, also The Drunks).\r Vel\u00e1zquez painted The Triumph of Bacchus after arriving in Madrid from Seville and just before his voyage to Italy. The work was painted for Philip IV, who paid Vel\u00e1zquez 100 ducats for it. The painting shows Bacchus surrounded by drunks. In Madrid, Vel\u00e1zquez was able to study the king's collection of Italian paintings and was no doubt struck by the nudity in many paintings as well as the treatment of mythological subjects.\r The Triumph of Bacchus has been described as the masterpiece of Vel\u00e1zquez's 1620s paintings.\r In the work, Bacchus is represented as a person at the center of a small celebration, but his skin is paler than that of his companions, rendering him more easily recognizable. Unusually, the rest of the group, apart from the figure naked to the waist behind the god, are in the contemporary costume of poor people in 17th-century Spain. The work represents Bacchus as the god who rewards or gifts men with wine, temporarily releasing them from their problems. In Baroque literature, Bacchus was considered an allegory of the liberation of man from the slavery of daily life.\r The scene can be divided in two halves. On the left, there is the very luminous Bacchus figure, his dominant but relaxed pose somewhat reminiscent of that of Christ in many Last Judgement scenes, who is often shown seated and naked to the waist. Bacchus and the character behind him are represented in the traditional loose robes used for depictions of classical myth. The idealization of the god's face is highlighted by the clear light which illuminates him in a more classicist style. The right side, however, presents some drunkards, men of the streets that invite us to join their party, with a very Spanish atmosphere similar to Jos\u00e9 de Ribera in style. There is no idealization present in their large and worn-out faces, though the figure kneeling in front of the god is younger and better dressed than the others, with a sword and tall boots. The light which illuminates Bacchus is absent on this side; the figures are shown with chiaroscuro and have much darker skin.\r In this work, Vel\u00e1zquez adopted a realist treatment of a mythological subject, a tendency he would pursue further during the following years.\r There are various elements of naturalism in this work, such as the bottle and pitcher which appear on the ground close to the god's feet; Vel\u00e1zquez employed the contrast of the god's bright body to lend relief and texture to the bottle and pitcher, creating something akin to a still life. These jars are very similar to the ones which appear in paintings made by Vel\u00e1zquez during his period in Seville, and the combination of still life elements of naturalistic genre figures relates to the bodegon subjects he painted there.\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Joseph's Bloody Coat Brought to Jacob\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/joseph-s-bloody-coat-brough-to-jacob-1630\n\nWikipedia Article:\nJoseph's Tunic is a 1630 painting by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, now held in the museum of the Sacrist\u00eda Mayor del Monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial (Madrid, Spain).

Critics agree that the work should be dated to 1630, the same year as his companion painting Joseph's Tunic. It appears that neither of the two paintings were commissioned by the king, although both became part of the royal collections within a short time. The painting became part of the collection of the Museo del Prado, in Madrid, in 1819.\r Apollo in the Forge of Vulcan has been cited as one of the most important works from Vel\u00e1zquez's first trip to Italy and \"one of his most successful compositions with regard to the unified, natural interaction of the figures.\"\r The painting depicts the moment when the god Apollo, identifiable by the crown of laurel on his head, visits Vulcan, who is found making weapons for war. The god Apollo tells Vulcan that his wife, Venus, is having an affair with Mars, the god of war. For this reason, the other figures in the room are looking in urprise at the god who has just appeared before them, some of them even opening their mouths to indicate surprise.\r Vel\u00e1zquez was inspired to create this work by an engraving by Antonio Tempesta, modifying it greatly and centering the narrative action on the arrival of Apollo, using a classical baroque style. It emphasises contemporary interest in nude figures, influenced by Greco-Roman statuary and the classical movement of Guido Reni. The frieze-style method of composition could also come from Reni. On the other hand, the clear shades of the figure of Apollo are reminiscent of Guercino.\r This work was created in Rome without commission at the request of the painter Peter Paul Rubens who had also visited Spain in 1629. Vel\u00e1zquez painted two large canvases in the house of the Spanish ambassador. These two canvases formed a pair and were brought back to Spain with his luggage: Joseph's Tunic and Apollo in the Forge of Vulcan.\r The subject is taken from Roman mythology, specifically from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Vel\u00e1zquez interpreted the scene into a strictly human version, with contemporary figures. Apollo is seen wearing a toga which leaves his torso exposed to view. Vulcan, in this picture, is just a blacksmith, as are his helpers, who are men from the village who know the trade. Vulcan is staring at him in astonishment after having heard the news of his wife's adultery with the god Mars, for whom he is forging armour at this very moment. The cave in which the blacksmith god forges weapons for the other deities in this painting is shown as a smithy, similar to those Vel\u00e1zquez could have seen in Spain or in Rome. With characteristic mastery Vel\u00e1zquez also painted a variety of objects which would be commonly found in a forge.\r Vel\u00e1zquez interest in nudes is not surprising, and evidence of this appears as early as his arrival in Madrid in 1623, although the appearance of them in his works increased after his first visit to Italy in the years 1629\u20131631.\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Villa Medici in Rome (Facade of the Grotto Logia)\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/villa-medici-in-rome-facade-of-the-grotto-logia-1630\n\nWikipedia Article:\nView of the Garden of the Villa Medici is a small painting by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez of the garden at the Villa Medici in Rome, with some figures standing watching an unseen event, possibly the works behind the scaffolding in the middle of the building in the background. It is now in the Prado. There is some controversy as to its date, with some scholars believing it was made during the artist's first trip to Italy (1629-31) and others feeling its advanced technique must mean it belongs to his second trip (1649-51). There is another version with similar features and the same title, and the two are of similar size and vary little in their execution and manner of depicting the garden.\r Landscape painting was rare in Spanish painting of this time, with most commissions being religious works or portraits, and so Vel\u00e1zquez was somewhat cut off from the mainstream of French and Italian landscape art as practised by Claude Lorrain or Poussin for example), making his use of an oil sketch rather than an easel-painted work unusual. Such a revolution put him 200 years ahead of the Impressionist painters in choosing landscape as a topic, then showing interest in light, nature and their interconnectedness, and finally in his pictorial technique (abandoning detail to stain rather than paint, with little touches of the brush better appreciated stood further back from the painting than too close to it). Vel\u00e1zquez thus showed that he was not only a good painter for his mastery of technique but also his innovation, ahead of its time and nationally and internationally revolutionising other painters' way of painting.\r Art critic Laura Cumming wrote that View of the Garden of the Villa Medici \"is one of the smallest paintings in the Prado and one of the greatest [...] a painting that insists upon nothing, that appreciates something as mean as a wall, that makes a wall as beautiful as a painting.\"\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Dona Antonia de Ipenarrieta y Galdos and her Son\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/dona-antonia-de-ipenarrieta-y-galdos-and-her-son\n\nWikipedia Article:\nDo\u00f1a Antonia de Ipe\u00f1arrieta y Gald\u00f3s and Her Son Don Luis is a 1634 portrait by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, now in the Prado Museum.

According to different studies of the canvas, it is believed that the child's figure could have been added afterwards.\r In this portrait, Vel\u00e1zquez begins to reinterpret long strokes influenced by Juan Pantoja de la Cruz, giving more expression and delicacy, expressing her natural and easy manner, and capturing a golden light with inexplicable technique. In any case, the experts consider the portrait of her husband to be superior.\r The portrait belonged to the family depicted in the painting until the year 1905, in which, its proprietor at the time, Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda del Pilar Azlor de Arag\u00f3n y Guillamas, XV Duchess of Villahermosa, the seventh grandchild of the woman in the portrait, bequeathed the painting and its partner, which belonged to the second husband of Do\u00f1a Antonia, Don Diego del Corral y Arellano, by the same artist, painted years before, to the Prado Museum of Madrid.\r In 1989 the painting was a part of an exposition on Vel\u00e1zquez which occurred in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\r Of noble ancestry, Do\u00f1a Antonia de Ipe\u00f1arrieta was the daughter of Crist\u00f3bal and Antonia, born in Villareal de Urrechu, in the Guip\u00fazcoa (Pa\u00eds Vasco) province, where her family owned a large palace located on the side of the Irimo mountain. She was the lady-in-waiting of the Queen Isabella II of Spain, and servant of the house of Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias; she died in Madrid in 1634.\r She was first married to Don Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez de Araciel, knight of the Order of Santiago, professor of law in the University of Salamanca and attorney general of the Council of Castile, who died in 1624. Once she became a widow, she got married again in Madrid in 1627 to Don Diego del Corral y Arellano, professor of law in the University of Salamanca, attorney of the Real Audiencia y Chanciller\u00eda de Valladolid (1608), attorney and advisor of the Consejo de Hacienda (1612 y 1622), attorney and advisor of the Supremo de Justicia (1616 y 1618), knight of the Order of Santiago (1622), and of the Council of Castile (1629).\r The third child of Do\u00f1a Antonia and her second husband, Don Diego, Luis was born in Madrid and was baptized under the name of Luis Vicente. He did not follow the family tradition of law and service of the Monarchy of Spain, and lived away from the court, residing in the cities of Madrid and Baeza, married to a cousin of his father, whom he did not succeed.\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Christ on the Cross\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/christ-on-the-cross-1632\n\nWikipedia Article:\nChrist Crucified is a 1632 painting by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez depicting the Crucifixion of Jesus. The work, painted in oil on canvas, measures 249 \u00d7 170 cm and is owned by the Museo del Prado.\r During his stay in Rome, Vel\u00e1zquez made various nude studies he used in later paintings, such as Apollo at the Forge of Vulcan (1630) and Joseph's Tunic (1630). Art critics assert that the nude study for this painting is exceptional and masterly in its fusion of serenity, dignity and nobility. It is a life-size frontal nude, without the support of a narrative scene.\r Vel\u00e1zquez followed the accepted iconography in the 17th century. His master, Francisco Pacheco, a big supporter of classicist painting, painted the crucified Christ using the same iconography later adopted by Vel\u00e1zquez: four nails, feet together and supported against a little wooden brace, in a classic contrapposto posture. Both arms draw a subtle curve, instead of forming a triangle. The loincloth is painted rather small, thus showing the nude body as much as possible. The head shows a narrow halo, as if it came from the figure itself; the face is resting on the chest, showing just enough of his features. The long, straight hair covers a great part of the face, perhaps foreshadowing the death, already inflicted as shown by the wound on the right side. It lacks the characteristic dramatic qualities of Baroque painting.\r Because of lack of information, the date of the painting is unknown. Nevertheless, historians believe the work was made after Vel\u00e1zquez' return from Italy, probably between 1631 and 1632. The influence of Classicist painting is shown by the calm posture of the body, the idealized face and the leaning head. On the other hand, the influence of Caravaggism can be seen in the strong chiaroscuro between the background and the body, and in the strong, artificial lightning over the cross.\r It was most likely a commission for the San Pl\u00e1cido Convent sacristy. The painting was among the impounded items of Manuel Godoy, but was returned to Mar\u00eda Teresa de Borb\u00f3n, 15th Countess of Chinch\u00f3n. After her death, the painting was passed on to her brother-in-law, the Duke of San Fernando de Quiroga, who gave it to King Fernando VII. The king then sent the painting to the Museo del Prado.\r The spirituality and mystery of this painting have inspired much religious writing, notably the poem El Cristo de Vel\u00e1zquez by the Spanish writer and philosopher Miguel de Unamuno.\r https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elbuscolu.com%2Fcontent%2F957%23at_pco%3Dsmlrebh-1.0%26at_si%3D56c37f216c2290cb%26at_ab%3Dper-2%26at_pos%3D0%26at_tot%3D4&redir_token=z64Q1RyfEoc-ibkKjDJoN2UFMmN8MTQ4NjczMjg1NEAxNDg2NjQ2NDU0 . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxLAzPJhQz0&t=110s .,., https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxLAzPJhQz0&t=110s .\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Don Baltasar Carlos with a Dwarf\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/don-baltasar-carlos-with-a-dwarf-1632\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPrince Balthasar Charles With a Dwarf is a 1631 portrait by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez of Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias and a court dwarf.

It is sometimes known as Silver Philip and is now in the National Gallery in London. It was the main portrait of Philip painted by Vel\u00e1zquez in the 1630s, used as the model for many workshop versions.\r The date of the work is not certain \u2013 the National Gallery website gives 1631/32, whilst Carrassat gives 1635 \u2013 but it was definitely the first portrait the artist produced after his first trip to Italy, in that it adopts the softer and more colourful palette of the Venetian school. There is some evidence that the portrait may have taken a number of years to complete, accounting for the uncertainty. Life size, it is unlike most portraits of Philip IV, in that it does not show him in his usual wholly black costume. Instead it shows him in a brown and silver embroidered costume (thus giving the portrait its name), painted with small rapid strokes, and wearing the insignia of the Order of the Golden Fleece on a golden chain. There are several pentimenti that fine tune the composition. The signature is on the letter Philip holds, a fictive petition from the painter to him. This is a sign of the importance Vel\u00e1zquez attached to the work, as he only signed a few of his paintings.\r It was almost certainly the painting on display in the library at the Escorial outside Madrid from the mid-17th century until 1809, when it was removed on the orders of Joseph Bonaparte, who had been placed on the throne of Spain by his brother Napoleon. He presented it to a General Desolle, despite a civil servant asking him to present a less important work. Desolle's daughter sold it after the general's death to the English collector William Thomas Beckford, on whose death in 1844 it was inherited by his son-in-law, the 10th Duke of Hamilton. It was bought by the National Gallery for \u00a36,300 at the 1882 Hamilton Palace Sale, a very high price for a Spanish painting at the time.\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Temptation of St.Thomas Aquinas\nArtwork Genre: religious painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/temptation-of-st-thomas-aquinas\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Temptation of St. Thomas is a painting by the Spanish Baroque painter Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, executed in 1632 and housed in the Museum of Sacred Art of Orihuela Cathedral, southern Spain.\r The work, for a period, was attributed to Murcian painter Nicol\u00e1s de Villacis, until it was recognized as Vel\u00e1zquez's in the 1920s.

It has been in the Museo del Prado in Madrid since its inauguration in 1819.\r The object of the work was to validate the power of Gaspar de Guzman, Count of Olivares and Duke of Sanl\u00facar la Mayor, known as the Count-Duke of Olivares, the chief minister under Philip IV of Spain, a Spanish nobleman and influential politician. In the style of Vel\u00e1zquez, this painting is an exception, as its design and color are more vigorous and pompous than his usual more somber portraits.\r Olivares is portrayed on horseback, an honor usually reserved for monarchs and reflects the power he attained as valido or right hand of the king (equivalent to the current prime minister's office). The picture resembles equestrian portraits Vel\u00e1zquez had painted for the Hall of Realms of the Buen Retiro Palace but was not made for this series, but rather as displaying a particular custom of Olivares bound for home. It is not dated but stands at just after this series, around 1638, and was possibly painted after the battle of Fuenterrab\u00eda, a military success that was attributed to Olivares although he was not personally involved. The picture did not join the royal collection at the predecessor of the Prado Museum until a century later.\r The Count-Duke looks at the viewer, making sure all can witness his feat. The figure is viewed from a low viewpoint and his torso is turned back, making it look more slender; Olivares had a massive body and was rather clumsy, as seen in the portraits that Velazquez had done before. The horse raises its front legs, performing a somersault or levade as it looks toward the battlefield. Drawing a diagonal from the hills that can be seen in the landscape, the composition provides energy to the portraiture; in this dynamism, the work reminds of Rubens. This equestrian portrait differs from those made for the royal family and is believed to have been suggested by Olivares; Velazquez had to take particular care, as Olivares was the highest political office of the court (after the king) and had supported him in his early days as a painter in Madrid.\r The Count-Duke wears a wide-brimmed feathered hat and the band of the State; the hand holds a marshal's baton, which marks the direction of the battle. The armor he wears is possibly preserved in the Palace of Liria of Madrid (collection of the House of Alba).\r The rich chromaticism and treatment of light give the scene a great vitality.\r The battle in the distance is treated with small spots. The landscape is very schematic, as defined Vel\u00e1zquez, with no buildings or characters. Perhaps it is because the painter did not know the town of Hondarribia, where the battle happened as described, although other sources believe the painting did not refer to any particular battle. The hills fade in green and blue tones, providing a feeling of remoteness, for it is said to have a very sharp aerial perspective.\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Equestrian Portrait of Philip III\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/equestrian-portrait-of-philip-iii-1635\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Equestrian Portrait of Philip III is a portrait of Philip III of Spain on horseback by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.

This last was smaller than those of the other family members, as it was intended to be hung on a door and therefore viewed from a lower perspective.\r As with the portrait of her husband, this portrait of Margarita evidences input from Velasquez' workshop. Velasquez retouched the work which his workshop produced, retouching the horse's harness in particular; this was originally very detailed. The same stroke fluidity can be observed in the redone head of the queen, but this process was reversed in the horse's mane and some portions of the landscape in the background, albeit hidden in the underlying technique of the painting.

It was completed during the years 1634\u201335, inspired by Vel\u00e1zquez's visit to Italy with Ambrogio Spinola, the Genoese general who conquered Breda on June 5, 1625. It is considered one of Vel\u00e1zquez's best works. Jan Morris has called it \"one of the most Spanish of all pictures\".\r The capture of Breda in 1625 was one of the major successes of Spanish arms in the latter stages of the Eighty Years' War. The Spanish general, Genoese aristocrat Ambrogio Spinola, conquered Breda against the instructions of his superiors. Before its capture, the Spanish government had decided that siege warfare against heavily defended towns of the Low Countries was too wasteful and that they would concentrate instead on an economic blockade of the Dutch Republic. The bulk of Spanish forces were diverted to the unfolding Thirty Years War.\r Breda, a city near the frontier of Holland proper had been occupied in 1567 by the Duke of Alba, ten years afterwards recovered by Holach, and again seized by Haultepenne. The town was the seat of the Orange family, who had a castle there.\r In 1624, the suspension of hostilities in Germany enabled the Spanish to concentrate their forces towards Breda. Although attacking such a formidable fortress was widely considered to be unwise, Ambrogio Spinola made the bewildering executive decision to march on Breda, accompanied by the Marquis de Legan\u00e9s and Carlos Coloma. Spinola had made a military reputation for himself in 1604 and been rewarded with the Golden Fleece for conquering Ostend in Flanders. Consequently, the siege of Breda was not only a clash between the Netherlands and Spain, but a \u201cdecisive contest between two famous generals, [Spinola and Dutch general Nassau], both well versed in the arts of fortification, who had their renown at stake\u201d.\r Defending the Dutch, Maurice of Nassau led hostilities against Spinola but died before the end of the siege. His successor, Frederick Henry, unsuccessfully attempted to revive Dutch momentum, but ultimately surrendered in May. The terms of defeat at Breda were some of the most honorable and lenient of the time. Spinola died in the autumn of 1630, only a year after Velazquez had sailed with him on the voyage to Italy. In 1637 Breda was recaptured by Frederick Henry after a four-month siege, and in 1648 it was finally ceded to the Dutch Republic by the Treaty of Westphalia.\r Vel\u00e1zquez painted The Surrender of Breda as an emblem of Spanish nationalism and as a tribute to Ambrogio Spinola. Diego Vel\u00e1zquez and Ambrogio Spinola had been thrown closely together \u201cDuring the voyage from Barcelona to Genoa, in 1629\u2026 The artist must also have been more deeply affected than others by the tragic result of the siege of Casale, which occurred soon after the voyage \u2013 how Spinola was shamefully sacrificed; and how, mortified at the slur cast on his military honor, he soon after sank with gloomy thoughts into the grave.\u201d\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Prince Balthasar Carlos dressed as a Hunter\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/prince-balthasar-carlos-dressed-as-a-hunter-1636\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPrince Balthasar Charles as a Hunter is a 1635 portrait of Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias by Vel\u00e1zquez. It is now held at the Museo del Prado.\r King Phillip IV commissioned Vel\u00e1zquez to paint a series of portraits on the theme of the hunt, all of which were to adorn the hunting lodge that was built in the mountain of Pardo, close to Madrid, called Torre de la Parada. This pavilion was later converted into an art museum with a long series of Ovid\u2019s Metamorphosis, painted by Rubens. This pavilion was reserved exclusively for the Court, and no-one else had access to it. It became one of the most important collections on the subject of mythology and a variety of nudes.\r Vel\u00e1zquez painted two other works for this location on the theme of the hunt: El cardenal infante don Fernando de Austria cazador and Felipe IV cazador. The three works have something in common: a long format, the figure presented in three quartes, hunting weapon in hand and hunting clothes on the protagonists. It is known the painter created many more works on this subject but none of them are in Spain.\r The prince is dressed in adequate clothing for this sport. A dark cloak with sleeves, wide jodhpurs, a grey embroidered blouse, a lace collar, knee-high boots, and a rifle of the appropriate size for a child.\r In the painting there are two dogs, which are never missing from a hunting scene. One of these is very large, so much so that the painter decided to represent him sleeping so that he would not detract from the slight figure of the prince; it has large ears and its head is lying on the ground. The other is a little dog that is leaving the painting, a cinnamon colored greyhound with lively eyes, whose head reaches the height of the child\u2019s hand.\r The landscape is represented by the presence of an oak that accompanies the figure. One appreciates the forest of Pardo and in the background the blue mountains of Madrid, in the distance.

It depicts a woman wearing a black lace veil on her head and a dark dress with a low-cut bodice. On the basis of its place in Vel\u00e1zquez's stylistic development, the portrait is thought to have been painted between 1638 and 1639. It is now in the Wallace Collection in London.\r The Lady with a Fan is an enigmatic portrait. Although most other Vel\u00e1zquez portraits are easily recognizable likenesses of the members of the Spanish royal family, their courtiers and court servants, the sitter in Lady with a Fan has not yet been convincingly identified; there is a lack of accurate documentary information about the portrait. The details of the costume suggest that the sitter for The Lady with a Fan could be Marie de Rohan, the duchess of Chevreuse (1600\u20131679), because she was dressed according to French fashion of the late 1630s. There one piece of evidence that Vel\u00e1zquez painted a Frenchwoman, a letter dated January 16, 1638, which stated that he once portrayed the exiled duchess of Chevreuse, who was then living in Madrid under the protection of Philip IV, after having escaped from France disguised as a man. But some experts argued that no resemblance could be discerned with other portraits of the duchess, and it was assumed that the costume of the woman in The Lady with a Fan revealed a Spanish tapada, which was a precursor to the majas of the 18th century.\r The Lady with a Fan was first recorded in the collection of Lucien Bonaparte in the early 19th century. It is believed that Bonaparte acquired it in Spain when he was there in 1801. But because there was no earlier record of the painting in any Spanish collection, it is also possible that he acquired it either in England or in Italy, where he spent most of the period of the Napoleonic Wars, or even in France, where Bonaparte met the then duke of Luynes, a direct descendant of the duchess of Chevreuse. Bonaparte's collection was sold in 1816. After further sales, in 1847 the painting was bought by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford (1800-1870), and on his death passed to his son Sir Richard Wallace and so to the Wallace Collection.\r There is a variant of the portrait, the Lady in a Mantilla, in the Devonshire collection. It has been in England since the eighteenth century.

It is housed in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\r The Needlewoman is an unfinished portrait, in which the head, modeled in light and shadow, is the most fully realized part. The arms and hands are sketched in briefly. The result displays Vel\u00e1zquez's facility for portraying gesture, his method of summarily constructing the figure, and his ability to suggest a subject's melding into the surrounding atmosphere.\r Similarities have been noted between The Needlewoman and The Lady with a Fan; not only do the facial features seem consistent, but so, too, is the brushwork of the face and chest. Although the subject's identity is not known for certain, it has been proposed that she was Francisca V\u00e9lazquez del Mazo, the artist's daughter. If, indeed, the subject in both paintings was the same sitter, it would at least suggest an intimacy between artist and subject.\r The attribution has not been uncontested. As recently as 1944 biographer F. J. S\u00e1nchez Cant\u00f3n concluded that the painting was begun by Vel\u00e1zquez but completed by his son-in-law, Juan Bautista Martinez del Mazo. However, the traditional attribution of the painting as entirely by the master is supported by the inventory made of the work in Vel\u00e1zquez's rooms at the time of his death, which includes a description of \"Another head, of a woman doing needlework\".\r The painting came into the possession of Andrew W.

It is now at the Museo del Prado.\r It was probably commissioned for the oratory of the court of Elisabeth of France, queen consort to Philip IV of Spain, in the Real Alc\u00e1zar of Madrid. There it joined others on Marian religious festivities by the Naples painter Andrea Vaccaro which had been brought to Madrid by cardinal Gaspar de Borja y Velasco. The model for Mary in the work may be the same model as the artist used for the Rokeby Venus.\r Vel\u00e1zquez's coronation of the Virgin is exceptional for being a rare religious work by an artist better known for his portraits, and for the air of naturalness and simplicity not found in works by other Baroque religious painters. Its composition is based on an inverted triangle, giving a sense of great equilibrium and harmonious lines and reminiscent (both in its colour and form) of a heart. The main figure is the Virgin Mary, with a modest, reverential, and emotional expression, lowered eyes, a straight nose and curved lips. The sense that the inverted triangle is meant to refer to a heart is reinforced and the viewer's piety invoked by Mary pointing to her own heart.\r To the viewer's right is God the Father, represented as a dignified old man, whilst to the left is the long-haired figure of Jesus Christ - together they hold Mary's crown above her head. In the centre the Holy Spirit is represented in the form of a white dove. The two figures' heads and the dove are all level, on the line of the triangle's base, representing their equality within the Holy Trinity. Also notable are the cherubs round the Virgin at the base of the painting - their pictorial quality rivals that of Murillo, famous for his cherub-themed works.\r The colours Vel\u00e1zquez uses are blues and violets. He also used carmines (especially Venetian carmine) instead of traditional reds, following the advice of his tutor Pacheco as written down in his book Arte de la Pintura, despite Vel\u00e1zquez already being an acclaimed artist and well beyond his student years by the time of producing this painting.\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Don Sebastian de Morra\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/don-sebastian-de-morra\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Sebasti\u00e1n de Morra is a portrait by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez of Sebasti\u00e1n de Morra, a court dwarf and jester at the court of Philip IV of Spain.

He looks directly at the viewer, motionless, making no hand gestures, leading one critic to suggest that the painting represents a denunciation of the court's treatment of de Morra and other dwarfs.

Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London.\r Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Vel\u00e1zquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Vel\u00e1zquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.\r The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Vel\u00e1zquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.\r The Rokeby Venus depicts the Roman goddess of love, beauty and fertility reclining languidly on her bed, her back to the viewer\u2014in Antiquity, portrayal of Venus from a back view was a common visual and literary erotic motif\u2014and her knees tucked. She is shown without the mythological paraphernalia normally included in depictions of the scene; jewellery, roses, and myrtle are all absent. Unlike most earlier portrayals of the goddess, which show her with blond hair, Vel\u00e1zquez's Venus is a brunette. The female figure can be identified as Venus because of the presence of her son, Cupid.\r Venus gazes into a mirror held by Cupid, who is without his usual bow and arrows. When the work was first inventoried, it was described as \"a nude woman\", probably owing to its controversial nature. Venus looks outward at the viewer of the painting through her reflected image in the mirror. However, the image is blurred and reveals only a vague reflection of her facial characteristics; the reflected image of the head is much larger than it would be in reality. The critic Natasha Wallace has speculated that Venus's indistinct face may be the key to the underlying meaning of the painting, in that \"it is not intended as a specific female nude, nor even as a portrayal of Venus, but as an image of self-absorbed beauty.\" According to Wallace, \"There is nothing spiritual about face or picture. The classical setting is an excuse for a very material aesthetic sexuality\u2014not sex, as such, but an appreciation of the beauty that accompanies attraction.\"\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Juan de Pareja\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/juan-de-pareja-1650\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Portrait of Juan de Pareja is a painting by Spanish artist Diego Vel\u00e1zquez of his assistant Juan de Pareja, a notable painter in his own right, who was enslaved and owned by Vel\u00e1zquez at the time the painting was completed. Vel\u00e1zquez painted the portrait in Rome, while was traveling in Italy, in 1650. It is the earliest known portrait of a Spanish man of African descent.\r It was the first painting to sell for more than \u00a31,000,000. At the time of the painting's purchase by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1970 they considered it \"among the most important acquisitions in the Museum's history\". The painting is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\r In 1648, as court painter to Philip IV of Spain, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez was sent to Rome to purchase works of art for the Alc\u00e1zar in Madrid. Vel\u00e1zquez brought with him Juan de Pareja, a slave, who served as an assistant in the artist's workshop. During his stay in Rome, Vel\u00e1zquez executed an oil portrait of Juan de Pareja, which was displayed as part of a larger exhibition of paintings at the Pantheon on 19 March 1650. According to Antonio Palomino's biography of Vel\u00e1zquez, the painting \"was generally applauded by all the painters from different countries, who said that the other pictures in the show were art but this one alone was 'truth'.\"\r Vel\u00e1zquez painted the portrait of Juan de Pareja, who was of Moorish descent, in his workshop, as an exercise in preparation for his official portrait of Pope Innocent X. The Pope, a ruddy-faced man who would be depicted in the bright pink and crimson robes of his office, presented a tricky study in both color and composition. Additionally, since he would be executing a portrait from life, Vel\u00e1zquez would be forced to work quickly while still capturing the essence of Innocent X's character. The Juan de Pareja reflects Vel\u00e1zquez's exploration of the difficulties he would encounter in the Pope's portrait. To compensate for a restricted palette of colors, Vel\u00e1zquez adopted a loose, almost impressionistic style of brushwork to bring an intense vitality to his subject.\r Juan de Pareja (circa 1610 \u2013 1670) became an artist in his own right, and in 1654 he was freed by Vel\u00e1zquez.\r The painting's ownership between its first exhibition at the Pantheon in Rome in 1650 and the end of the eighteenth century is unknown. There is no record of the painting in Spain. The earliest record of the ownership of the painting was in essay written in 1765 by Francisco Preciado, Director of the Royal Spanish Academy in Rome. He stated that the painting owned by Cardinal Trajano D'Acquaviva (1694-1747) who lived in Rome.\r The painting then reappears in the record as part of the dukes of Baranello's collection in Naples sometime in the 1700s. It was recorded as part of the collection of Sir William Hamilton, the British Ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples from 1764 to 1798. The inventory of his residence in Naples, Palazzo Sessa, lists \"a portrait of a Moresco slave by Velazquez.\" Hamilton sent the portrait and his other works of art to London for safekeeping, on board the ship HMS Fondroyant the flagship of Lord Nelson, when he left Naples. Hamilton returned to England heavily in debt and the portrait was auctioned at Christie's in 1801. The auction catalogue listed the painting as Velazquez's \"Portrait of a Moorish Slave, that was in his service, and became a great Painter\". It sold for 39 guineas and disappeared from the record again.\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Portrait of Pope Innocent X\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/portrait-of-pope-innocent-x-1650\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPortrait of Pope Innocent X is an oil on canvas portrait by the Spanish painter Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, executed during a trip to Italy around 1650. Many artists and art critics consider it the finest portrait ever created. It is housed in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj in Rome. A smaller version is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and a study is on display at Apsley House in London. The painting is noted for its realism, in that it is an unflinching portrait of a highly intelligent, shrewd but aging man. He is dressed in linen vestments, and the quality of the work is evident in the rich reds of his upper clothing, head-dress, and the hanging curtains.\r The pope, born Giovanni Battista Pamphilj, was initially wary of having his portrait taken by Vel\u00e1zquez, but relented after he was given reproductions of examples of Vel\u00e1zquez's portraiture. A contributing factor for this large advancement in the painter's career was that he had already depicted a number of members of Pamphilj's inner court. Yet the pope remained wary and cautious, and the painting was initially displayed to only his immediate family, and was largely lost from public view through the 17th and 18th centuries. The parchment held by the pope contains Vel\u00e1zquez's signature.\r The portrait was painted during Vel\u00e1zquez's second voyage to Italy, between 1649 and 1651. The Pope's vestments being of light linen, it was probably painted during the summer, most likely in 1650. Vel\u00e1zquez included his signature on the paper the Pope is holding, but it is difficult to read the date. There are two versions of the story of how Vel\u00e1zquez came to paint the portrait. According to one of them, while visiting the Vatican City, Vel\u00e1zquez, already a renowned painter, was granted an audience with Pope Innocent X. He offered to paint a portrait of the Pope, but Innocent X doubted, mistrusting Vel\u00e1zquez's fame. Hence, he asked Vel\u00e1quez to offer some proof of his painting skills. It would have been then that Vel\u00e1zquez painted the portrait of his servant Juan de Pareja (today at display in the Metropolitan Museum of New York). Once the Pope saw the portrait of Juan de Pareja, he allowed Vel\u00e1zquez to paint the portrait.\r Apparently, when the Pope saw the finished portrait, he exclaimed, somewhat disconcerted: \"Troppo vero!\" (\"all too true!\"), though he was not able to deny the intrinsic quality of the portrait as a masterpiece. Experts doubt the veracity of this story, and argue that the Pope allowed Vel\u00e1zquez to paint him because he had already painted with great success other people from the inner papal court, including the Pope's own barber.\r The portrait was kept at private display by Innocent's family, the Pamphilj, who would display it in the Doria-Pamphilj gallery where it remains to this day. It was a relatively secret masterpiece for much of the 17th and 18th centuries, only known to some connoisseurs who, nonetheless, would inevitably praise the work as one of the finest portraits ever produced. French historian Hippolyte Taine considered the portrait as \"the masterpiece amongst all portraits\" and said that \"once it has been seen, it is impossible to forget\".\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Las Meninas\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/las-meninas-detail-of-the-lower-half-depicting-the-family-of-philip-iv-of-spain-1656\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLas Meninas (pronounced\u00a0[las me\u02c8ninas]; Spanish for The Ladies-in-waiting) is a 1656 painting in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Its complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted. Because of these complexities, Las Meninas has been one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting.\r The painting shows a large room in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid during the reign of King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Vel\u00e1zquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Vel\u00e1zquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position similar to that of the viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Vel\u00e1zquez is shown working on.\r Las Meninas has long been recognised as one of the most important paintings in Western art history. The Baroque painter Luca Giordano said that it represents the \"theology of painting\" and in 1827 the president of the Royal Academy of Arts Sir Thomas Lawrence described the work in a letter to his successor David Wilkie as \"the true philosophy of the art\". More recently, it has been described as \"Vel\u00e1zquez's supreme achievement, a highly self-conscious, calculated demonstration of what painting could achieve, and perhaps the most searching comment ever made on the possibilities of the easel painting\".\r In 17th-century Spain, painters rarely enjoyed high social status. Painting was regarded as a craft, not an art such as poetry or music. Nonetheless, Vel\u00e1zquez worked his way up through the ranks of the court of Philip\u00a0IV, and in February 1651 was appointed palace chamberlain (aposentador mayor del palacio). The post brought him status and material reward, but its duties made heavy demands on his time. During the remaining eight years of his life, he painted only a few works, mostly portraits of the royal family. When he painted Las Meninas, he had been with the royal household for 33 years.\r Philip\u00a0IV's first wife, Elizabeth of France, died in 1644; and their only son, Balthasar Charles, died two years later. Lacking an heir, Philip married Mariana of Austria in 1649, and Margaret Theresa (1651\u20131673) was their first child, and their only one at the time of the painting. Subsequently, she had a short-lived brother Philip Prospero (1657\u20131661), and then Charles (1661\u20131700) arrived, who succeeded to the throne as Charles\u00a0II at the age of three. Vel\u00e1zquez painted portraits of Mariana and her children, and although Philip himself resisted being portrayed in his old age he did allow Vel\u00e1zquez to include him in Las Meninas. In the early 1650s he gave Vel\u00e1zquez the Pieza Principal (\"main room\") of the late Balthasar Charles's living quarters, by then serving as the palace museum, to use as his studio. It is here that Las Meninas is set. Philip had his own chair in the studio and would often sit and watch Vel\u00e1zquez at work. Although constrained by rigid etiquette, the art-loving king seems to have had an unusually close relationship with the painter. After Vel\u00e1zquez's death, Philip wrote \"I am crushed\" in the margin of a memorandum on the choice of his successor.\n", "\nArtist: Diego Velazquez\nArtwork Name: Portrait of the Infanta Margarita\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/portrait-of-the-infanta-margarita\n\nWikipedia Article:\nInfanta Margarita Teresa in a Blue Dress is one of the best known portraits by Spanish painter Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.

Currently, the painting is in the Kunsthistorisches Museum.\r This is one of the several court portraits made by Vel\u00e1zquez on different occasions of Infanta Margaret Theresa who, at fifteen, married her uncle, Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. She's the little infanta who appears in Las Meninas (1656). These paintings show her in different stages of her childhood; they were sent to Vienna to inform Leopold of what his young fianc\u00e9e looked like.\r The Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna has two other outstanding paintings by Vel\u00e1zquez: Infanta Maria Teresa and Prince Philip Prospero.

The infanta, here eight years old, is shown with a solemn expression. She wears a blue silk dress which is adorned with silver borders after the Spanish fashion of the era; the most striking characteristic is the huge expanse of the voluminous crinoline which is accentuated by the trimmed borders and the wide lace collar. In one of her hands she holds a brown fur muff, perhaps a present from Vienna.

The painting depicts an elderly man in traditional Ottoman religious costume which predates the introduction of the fez and the spread of Western style dress with the Tanzimat reforms in the mid 19th century. He holds a traditional ney flute with which he is attempting to \"train\" the tortoises at his feet.\r Osman Hamdi Bey created the painting at a time of great social and political turmoil in the Ottoman Empire.

The relatively small image is regarded as one of the Danish Golden Age masterpieces.\r The painting shows a woman with her back turned, with bare torso by an oval mirror, that reflects her face and the top of her chest. Her left hand rests on a green dressing table in the image left. On the table you also see a box with an open lid. With her right hand she has lifted and taken to the brown hair that is tightly put up with center parting and chignon. Her big red left earlobe has a gold glistening earring. her right earring is also seen, not in the mirror, and hairstyle are also different in the mirror. The head is turned slightly to the left and sunk.\r The woman's lower body is draped with a white cloth, which is well down her buttocks. Her right leg seems to be slightly bent upward in contrapposto.\r The woman is located offset to the left relative to the center line of the image, whereas the mirror is on the right. The oval mirror with the wooden frame mirrors so as to face viewed approximately in the middle of the mirror. The mirror has a size so that only the top portion of the woman's breasts seen. The woman raised his right arm covers parts of the mirror image so you can not see the bottom part of the face. In the mirror image is also seen that women do not consider themselves in the mirror, but the gaze directed downward to the left. There is no eye contact with the viewer.\r The wall where the mirror hangs is plain, however, with some text. In the left of the picture is an oblique shadow on the wall and down the left wall. On the bottom right is a panel at the height of her thighs. In the reflection you see a closed door.\r The picture is not particularly large, only 33.5 \u00d7 26 centimeters.\r Eckersberg was a professor at the art academy and had in 1833 he introduced that students could paint for female nudes. Eckersberg painted together with his students, and painting with the woman comes from a session in late summer 1841. The model's name was Florentine and she stood model for over a month that summer. The position she occupies in Ecker's painting, drawing and painting, he and the students after the period from 9 August to 16 September. Two of the students' paintings are known. This is one of Ludvig August Smith and Sally Henriques. The composition of their paintings are similare. Henriques painted her back more s-shaped, and there are differences in how the face is covered by the right arm and the angle at which the arm is held. The color scheme also seems to be different. The woman's back in Ludvig August Smiths painting has an attitude there is more follow Eckersberg than Henriques. Unlike Eckersberg, Smith painted the woman roughly in the middle of the imag. In Ecker's painting the mirror image assumes a greater weight. From the angles of the images can conclude that Eckersberg has reserved the best seat for himself while Smith has stood by Ecker's right, Henriques far right.\n", "\nArtist: Peder Severin Kroyer\nArtwork Name: Hip, Hip, Hurrah! Artists' Party at Skagen\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/peder-severin-kroyer/hip-hip-hurrah-1888\n\nWikipedia Article:\nHip, Hip, Hurrah! (Danish: Hip, hip, hurra! Kunstnerfest p\u00e5 Skagen) is an oil-on-canvas painting from 1888 by Norwegian-Danish painter Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer.\r The work shows various members of what Kr\u00f8yer referred to as the \"guild\" of Skagen Painters: a group of Danish, Norwegian and Swedish artists who formed a loose community in Skagen at the northern tip of Jutland in the 1880s and early 1890s. Hip, Hip, Hurrah! is typical of the work produced by the Skagen Painters; very much in the style of the French Impressionists and Naturalists, it celebrates the play of light in the scene (and in composition and subject draws obvious comparisons to Renoir's Luncheon of the Boating Party), but at the same time it harks back to the freundschaftbild tradition of artists of the Danish Golden Age such as Ditlev Blunck and Wilhelm Bendz in depicting artistic communities spontaneously drawing together. The development of Kr\u00f8yer's Skagen style can be seen by comparing Hip, Hip, Hurrah! with Ved frokosten (Artists' Luncheon at Skagen), a similarly themed 1883 painting which features many of the same people; and with later works like Sommeraften ved Skagens strand. Kunstneren og hans hustru (Summer Evening at Skagen beach. The Artist and his Wife) and Roser (Roses).\r The painting was started in 1884 after a party at Michael Ancher's house; the composition was inspired by photographs taken at the celebration by the German artist Fritz Stoltenberg, although the individuals featured are not all the same. Kr\u00f8yer returned uninvited to Ancher's house the morning after the gathering with his easel and paints, eager to start sketching and expecting the freedom to come and go as he pleased. His lack of consideration annoyed Ancher, who had only recently moved to the house in an attempt to escape the hustle and bustle of town life; as a result, the two artists suffered their first serious falling-out. Although they reconciled soon afterwards, Kr\u00f8yer did not get the unlimited access to Ancher's garden that he had expected and, frustrated, he struggled to progress with the work. He made do with the garden at Ancher's old apartment and worked from photographs and from life when he got the chance. It was four years before he could complete the picture. Helga, Ancher's daughter, who had been less than a year old at the time of the original festivities, is shown to be older in the final painting, suggesting she was not included until later in the composition. A photo of the painting in Kr\u00f8yer's studio shows an earlier composition before the older Helga was added. Swedish art collector Pontus F\u00fcrstenberg bought the painting unseen (or at least before it was completed). It was displayed at Charlottenborg in 1888, and F\u00fcrstenberg later donated it to the Gothenburg Museum of Art, where it has hung ever since. The Skagens Museum has a small sketch from 1888.\r From left to right the people pictured are: Martha M\u00f8ller Johansen and her husband, the painter Viggo Johansen, Norwegian painter Christian Krohg, Kr\u00f8yer, Degn Br\u00f8ndum (Anna Ancher's brother), Michael Ancher, Swedish painter Oscar Bj\u00f6rck, Danish painter Thorvald Niss, teacher Helene Christensen (who was romantically involved with Kr\u00f8yer), Danish painter Anna Ancher and her daughter Helga Ancher.\n", "\nArtist: Peder Severin Kroyer\nArtwork Name: Summer Evening at Skagen\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/peder-severin-kroyer/summer-evening-at-skagen-1892\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSummer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore (Danish: Sommeraften ved Skagen. Kunstnerens hustru med hund ved strandkanten) is an 1892 painting by P.S. Kr\u00f8yer, one of the best known of the artistic community known as the Skagen Painters. The work shows Marie Kr\u00f8yer, the artist's wife, standing on the beach at Skagen with their dog Rap at her side and the moonlight reflected in the sea.\r The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of Jutland, painting the local fishermen and their own family life, gatherings and celebrations. Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer (1851\u20131909), who was born in Stavanger, Norway, but brought up in Copenhagen, first arrived in Skagen in 1882 and returned almost every summer, finally settling there permanently after marrying Marie Triepcke in 1889. He had already gained a reputation for his paintings of the fishermen in Hornb\u00e6k on the north coast of Zealand and had been influenced by the Impressionist movement during his travels to France. In Skagen, he became one of the central and most enthusiastic members of the artistic community creating masterpieces emphasizing the special effects of the local light, particularly in his beach scenes, and painting several memorable works recording the lively gatherings of the artists.\r Marie Kr\u00f8yer n\u00e9e Triepcke came from a well-to-do German family living in Copenhagen. From an early age she aspired to become an artist and after training privately she went to Paris to continue her studies. It was there, in early 1889, that she met Kr\u00f8yer who immediately fell madly in love with her. Although he was 16 years her senior, the couple married that summer. In 1891, they settled in Skagen, giving Kr\u00f8yer ample opportunity to paint portraits of Marie, both indoors and especially on the beach. The summers Kr\u00f8yer spent together with his wife in the 1890s were clearly a source of inspiration for him, especially as Marie had a strong sense of beauty herself, often quoting Keats' \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty\". As a result of the periods of mental illness Kr\u00f8yer experienced from 1900, the marriage fell apart. In 1912, she married the Swedish composer Hugo Alfv\u00e9n who had also been taken by her beauty. It is believed Marie was reluctant to paint after meeting Kr\u00f8yer whom she looked up to as a far more competent artist. A few of her works have nevertheless survived.\r The work is oil on canvas and it measures 206 by 123 centimetres (81\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a048\u00a0in). Marie Kr\u00f8yer is shown in profile and her melancholy face and bright dress glow under the light of the setting sun. The painting is one of the works in which Kr\u00f8yer tries to capture the light and mood on the Skagen shore during what he called \"l'heure bleue\" (the blue hour), the short period at dusk when the light casts a blue tint over the landscape. The moon's reflection adds a slight feeling of depth to the otherwise flat background which consists mostly of the monolithic blue sea. Although Marie is depicted as being at a similar height to the viewer, the horizon rises above her head, so her radiance is emphasized by comparison with the muted, nearly monochrome background.\n", "\nArtist: Peder Severin Kroyer\nArtwork Name: Summer evening on Skagen's beach\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/peder-severin-kroyer/summer-evening-on-skagen-s-beach-1899\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSummer Evening at Skagen Beach \u2013 The Artist and his Wife (Danish: Sommeraften ved Skagens strand. Kunstneren og hans hustru) is an 1899 painting by Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer. One of the best known paintings of the Skagen Painters, it depicts Kr\u00f8yer with his wife Marie and his dog Rap strolling on the beach in the moonlight.\r The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of Jutland, painting the local fishermen and their own gatherings. P.S. Kr\u00f8yer arrived there in 1882, quickly becoming the most prominent member of the group.\r In 1895, in a letter to his friend Oscar Bj\u00f6rck, Kr\u00f8yer wrote \"I am also thinking of painting a large portrait of my wife and me together \u2014 but for that I shall definitely need good weather, so it won't be this year.\" In fact it was four years later, in the summer of 1899, that he finally created his large painting. Maybe it was in recognition of 10 years of marriage with Marie Triepcke as illustrated in other works of family life at the time as well as in a number of the photographs and sketches he used as a basis for the work.\r The final result nevertheless has a rather melancholic tone. Despite the beautiful surroundings, Marie appears distant, disappearing into the blue moonlight. Even Kr\u00f8yer's own weak figure seems to be experiencing difficulty in supporting her on his arm while the closest figure of all is Kr\u00f8yer's faithful dog, Rap. After Kr\u00f8yer had worked on the painting throughout the summer, he submitted it to the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1900. It was not very well received there, being criticized as banal. In fact, it presents the blue half-light, a favourite with the Symbolists who believed the twilight hour heralded the coming of death. In 1907, Kr\u00f8yer conveyed his own feelings about Skagen evenings: \"Skagen can look so terribly dull in the bright sunlight ... but when the sun goes down, when the moon rises up out of the sea, ... with the fishermen standing on the beach and the cutters sailing by with loosened sails ... in recent years this has been the time I like most of all.\" A few months after the spring exhibition, Kr\u00f8yer was admitted to Middelfart Mental Hospital after suffering a nervous breakdown.\n", "\nArtist: Peder Severin Kroyer\nArtwork Name: St John's Eve Bonfire on Skagen's Beach\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/peder-severin-kroyer/st-john-s-eve-bonfire-on-skagen-s-beach-1906\n\nWikipedia Article:\nMidsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach (Danish: Sankt Hansblus p\u00e5 Skagen strand) is a 1906 painting by P.S. Kr\u00f8yer. The large work, which took several years to complete, shows many of the artists in the group known as the Skagen Painters as well as influential members of Skagen's local community.\r The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of Jutland, painting the local fishermen and their own gatherings and celebrations. Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer (1851\u20131909), who was born in Stavanger, Norway, but brought up in Copenhagen, first arrived in Skagen in 1882 and returned almost every summer, finally settling there after marrying Marie Triepcke in 1889. He had already gained a reputation for his paintings of the fishermen in Hornb\u00e6k on the north coast of Zealand and had been influenced by the Impressionist movement in his travels to France. In Skagen, he became one of the central and most enthusiastic members of the group of painters, creating masterpieces emphasizing the special effects of the local light in his beach scenes while painting several memorable works recording the lively gatherings of the artists.\r The painting depicts many of the members of the artists' colony as well as local inhabitants gathered around the traditional midsummer bonfire, celebrated in Denmark on Sankt Hans aften. The artists and the influential personalities from the village are on the left while the rest of the inhabitants are on the right. Kr\u00f8yer originally made a sketch of the event in 1892 but it took him 14 years to complete the large painting which measures 149.5 centimetres (58.9\u00a0in) x 257 centimetres (101\u00a0in).\r In her Northern Lights, Lise Svanholm tells us Kr\u00f8yer took his easel onto the beach at Skagen \u00d8sterby in 1903 and spent a couple of hours making an extensive sketch. In the foreground, Kr\u00f8yer's daughter Vibeke stands in front of Marie Kr\u00f8yer's brother, Valdemar Triepcke, next to Walter Schwartz, the mayor's son. Otto and Alba Schwartz come next, then Michael Ancher in his straw hat beside Degn Br\u00f8ndum, the innkeeper. In the next row is Br\u00f8ndum's daughter, Anna Ancher in a green shawl, Henry Brodersen, then the treasurer's wife and, at the end of the row, Schr\u00f8der, the postmaster with his little wife Soffi. In addition to the painters, the work includes the writer Holger Drachmann, the head of the lifeboat service, Captain P.K. Nielsen, and the town's treasurer, Brodersen, with his sister in law, Mrs Dethlef J\u00fcrgensen, on his arm. On the right-hand side, the artist Laurits Tuxen can be seen with Frederikke who is looking up wonderously at her husband. Tuxen is sketching the scene, resulting in a work which can be seen in Skagens Museum (Kr\u00f8yer Painting the Midsummer Bonfire, 1906). The red and orange flames are blowing over towards Hugo Alfv\u00e9n, with Marie on his arm, leaning on a fishing boat.\r The painting is one of the most important in the collection at Skagens Museum, although Kr\u00f8yer himself felt the work was too dark, especially the sky which should have been brighter. He recognized it was not one of his best works but believed it would have considerable historic importance. On signing the painting, however, his daughter Vibike remembers a celebration which reached such heights that Drachmann threw his glass down on the floor. Apparently Kr\u00f8yer replied: \"I find, Drachmann, you should think twice before flinging other people's glasses on the floor. It was not your fault it didn't break.\"\n"]}
