    "This code implements a workflow-based memory generation system that combines LangGraph and GPT-4 mini to process interactions into structured memories. The system takes predefined memory schemas (episodic, semantic, procedural, prospective) and generates contextual memories through a graph-based workflow, maintaining hierarchical organization (type → label → content → context)."
