    "## Overview\n",
    "This code implements a semi-autonomous memory schema generation system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and graph-based workflows to create structured memory representations. The system is built on LangGraph and uses GPT-4 mini to generate memory schemas across four fundamental memory types: procedural, semantic, episodic, and prospective. Each generated schema follows a hierarchical structure (type → label → description) and can be iteratively refined through user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation demonstrates a practical approach to automated knowledge structuring while maintaining human oversight. It showcases how modern AI tools can be used to systematically generate complex memory structures while allowing for human guidance and quality control in the generation process."

    "## Motivation\n",
    "Several key factors motivate this implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Knowledge Structure Automation**\n",
    "   - Manual creation of memory schemas is time-consuming and often inconsistent\n",
    "   - Automated generation can significantly speed up the initial structuring of knowledge\n",
    "   - LLMs can provide sophisticated, context-aware schema suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flexible Control Flow**\n",
    "   - The need for systems that balance automation with human oversight\n",
    "   - Importance of iterative refinement in knowledge structure development\n",
    "   - Value of maintaining schema history and evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standardized Memory Organization**\n",
    "   - Need for consistent categorization across different types of memories\n",
    "   - Importance of structured approaches to knowledge representation\n",
    "   - Benefits of using established memory type categories (procedural, semantic, episodic, prospective)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interactive Development**\n",
    "   - Recognition that initial automated outputs may need refinement\n",
    "   - Value of human expertise in guiding schema development\n",
    "   - Importance of flexible iteration in knowledge structure development\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation addresses these motivations by providing a framework that combines automated generation with human oversight, allowing for systematic development of memory schemas while maintaining quality control and flexibility."
